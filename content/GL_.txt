premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency investment income expenses and target profit margins these assumptions are based on company experience and projected investment earnings rates revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products profitability is affected by actual experience deviations from the established assumptions and to the extent investment income varies from that required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income in excess of the amounts required for policy reserves 

gl 2021 form 10k 

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each globe life insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information obtained from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants including but not limited to inspection reports pharmacy data motor vehicle records responses to both medical and not medical questions doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in globe lifes consolidated financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these reserves with future premiums and the associated interest compounded at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health insurance policies written by globe lifes insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis the assumptions used in the calculation of globe lifes reserves are reported in note 1—significant accounting policies  reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

reinsurance 

globe life has historically participated in very limited thirdparty reinsurance as a result of the low face amounts of the policies sold by the company see schedule iv and note 6—commitments and contingencies for more information 

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of globe life insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities approximately 94 of our invested assets at fair value are fixed maturities at december 31 2021 see note 4—investments and management’s discussion and analysis  

competition 

  

globe life competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with globe life no individual company dominates any of globe lifes life or health insurance markets 

  

globe lifes health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

the company effectively competes with other carriers in part due to its ability to operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows globe life to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

regulation 

insurance —insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted insurance companies are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the 

gl 2021 form 10k 

national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

riskbased capital rbc —the naic requires that a riskbased capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the riskbased capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all globe lifes insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the riskbased capital formula see further discussion of rbc in capital resources  

holding company —states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system globe life and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in indiana nebraska ohio and new york

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

the insurance industry is a regulated industry populated by many public and private companies we operate in the industrys life and health insurance sectors each of which has its own set of risks 

business and operational risks 

the development and maintenance of our various distribution channels are critical to growth in product sales and profits 

recruiting development and retention of producing agents are critical to support sales growth in our agency operations because our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals and the face amounts of the life insurance policies sold are typically lower than those of policies sold in higherincome markets if we do not provide an attractive career opportunity with competitive compensation and that motivates producing agents to increase sales of our products our growth could be impeded in addition a failure to effectively develop new methods of reaching consumers and realizing cost efficiencies in our direct to consumer division business could result in reduced sales and profits 

our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit hire motivate develop and retain highlyskilled insurance personnel doing so may be difficult due to many factors including but not limited to fluctuations in economic and industry conditions and the effectiveness of our compensation programs and competition among other employers 

our life insurance products are sold in niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish 

we have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches three of which are labor unions affinity groups and sales via direct to consumer solicitations deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to direct to consumer marketing initiatives could negatively affect our life insurance business 

the impact of covid19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations financial position andor liquidity 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic and us and international responses are wideranging costly disruptive and rapidly changing the global covid19 pandemic has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in significant disruptions in economic activity and financial markets covid19 has directly and indirectly adversely affected the company and will likely continue to do so for an uncertain period of time because of the size and breadth of this pandemic and the impact of related government and regulatory actions all of the direct and indirect consequences of covid19 on the company are not yet known and may not emerge for some time 

the covid19 pandemic subjects the company to various potential risks that could adversely affect the company in different ways including but not limited to the following 

• reduced sales resulting from potential limitations in the virtual sales and agent recruiting process or reductions in the willingness or ability of consumers to purchase our products 

• reduced cash flows from lower premiums higher surrenders and greater than anticipated claim payments 

• disruptions delays and increased costs and risks related to employees working remotely having limited or no access to our facilities and experiencing reductions or interruptions of critical or essential services 

• ratings downgrades increased bankruptcies and credit spread widening in industries in which we invest in our investment portfolio 

for the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded approximately 140 million of covid19 life claims this amount includes certain estimates utilizing accepted actuarial practices of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for claims that have occurred by the end of the year whether known or unknown given the great uncertainties associated with covid19 and its impact and the limited information 

gl 2021 form 10k 

upon which our current assumptions and assessments have been made our reserves and the underlying estimated level of claim losses and costs arising from covid19 may materially change 

actual or alleged misclassification of independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries could result in adverse legal tax or financial consequences 

a significant portion of our sales agents are independent contractors although we believe we have properly classified such individuals a risk nevertheless exists that a court the internal revenue service or other authority will take the position that those sales agents are employees the laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of workers are subject to change and differing interpretations which we cannot predict 

if there is an adverse determination regarding the classification of some or all of the independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries by a court or governmental agency we could incur significant costs with respect to payroll tax liabilities employee benefits wage payments fines judgments andor legal settlements any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any resulting reclassification could necessitate significant changes in our affected insurance subsidiaries’ business models 

financial and strategic risks 

our investments are subject to market and credit risks significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses 

our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values our investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed maturity and shortterm investments where we are exposed to the risk that individual issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments a concentration of these investments in any particular issuer industry group of related industries or geographic areas could increase this risk factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels consisting of both treasury rate and credit spread financial market performance disruptions in credit markets general economic conditions legislative changes particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control 

additionally as the majority of our investments are longterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity a significant increase in interest rates or a market downturn could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses could substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses could experience a credit event where an allowance for credit loss is recorded reducing net income 

  

we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all significant downgrades or defaults of issuers could negatively impact our riskbased capital ratios leading to potential downgrades of the company by rating agencies potential reduction in future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries andor higher financing costs at the parent company should additional statutory capital be required 

  

changes in interest rates could negatively affect income  

declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate net policy liabilities which could have a negative impact on income significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers any such calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower interest rates 

an increase in interest rates could result in certain policyholders surrendering their life or annuity policies for cash thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate invested assets if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations in such a case realized losses could result from the sale of the invested assets and could adversely affect our statutory income required capital levels and results of operations 

gl 2021 form 10k 

our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on available funds from our insurance subsidiaries 

as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity include a variety of shortterm and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper longterm debt federal home loan bankfhlb intercompany financing and reinsurance 

the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on regulations by their states of domicile accordingly impairments in assets or disruptions in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduce their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow the payment of dividends a principal source of our cash flow to us 

  

changes in laws or regulations in the states in which our companies are domiciled could constrain the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to pay our debt obligations corporate expenses or dividends on our capital stock 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital 

should interest rates increase in the future the higher interest expense on any new issued debt may reduce net income in addition if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions could limit our ability to replace maturing debt obligations in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability and cost of additional financing or capital depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we would prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility if so our results of operations financial condition consolidated rbc and cash flows could be materially negatively affected 

  

industry risks 

variations in actualtoexpected rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we establish policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models and accounting requirements that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of 

gl 2021 form 10k 

significant judgment with respect to investment yields levels of mortality morbidity persistency and investment yields as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test actualtoexpected results actual results may differ significantly from the levels assumed which could result in increased policy obligations and expenses and thus negatively affect our profit margins and income 

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us by limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and reducing our sales by adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through independent insurance agencies 

the supplemental health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny 

regulatory changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health business the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our supplemental health insurance business 

obtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain supplemental health insurance policies is critical 

a significant percentage of the supplemental health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance including conditions under which the premiums for such policies may be increased is highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result our medicare supplement business is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success since medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are typically necessary accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of appropriate premium rate increases for supplemental health insurance plans in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events that could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a pandemic hurricane earthquake or manmade catastrophes including acts of terrorism or war which may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 

our life and health insurance products are particularly exposed to risks of catastrophic mortality such as a pandemic or other events that result in a large number of deaths in addition the occurrence of such an event in a concentrated geographic area could have a severe disruptive effect on our workforce and business operations the likelihood and severity of such events cannot be predicted and are difficult to estimate in such an event the impact to our operations could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition particularly if those problems affect employees performing operations tasks and supporting computerbased data processing or destroy the capability to transmit store and retrieve valuable data in addition in the event that a significant number of our management were unavailable following a disaster our strategic plan could be negatively impacted 

gl 2021 form 10k 

our business is subject to the risk of direct or indirect effects of climate change 

climate change may increase the frequency and severity of weatherrelated natural disasters and pandemics which may adversely impact our mortality and morbidity rates and disrupt our business operations in addition climate change and climate change regulation may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities we hold or our willingness to continue to hold their securities climate change may also influence investor sentiment with respect to the company and investments in our portfolio we cannot predict how legal regulatory and social responses to concerns around climate change may impact our business 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth 

insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of policyholders not investors regulatory agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions included in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising agent licensing policy forms capital adequacy solvency reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting our companies may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business should regulatory changes occur we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of such laws and regulations if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend some or all of our business activities andor impose substantial fines 

  

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs or negatively impact our insurance subsidiaries capital 

changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry including the products insurers offer could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries capital or limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to sell certain of their products 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may affect our financial statements reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition 

our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap and accounting practices as promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners’ statutory accounting practices naic sap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements these changes including underlying assumptions projections estimates or judgmentsinterpretations by management could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations refer to note 1— significant accounting policies under the caption accounting pronouncements yet to be adopted  

noncompliance with laws or regulations related to customer and consumer privacy and information security including a failure to ensure that our business associates with access to sensitive customer and consumer information maintain its confidentiality could materially adversely affect our reputation and business operations 

the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of personally identifiable information by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels applicable laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba the health information technology for 

gl 2021 form 10k 

economic and clinical health act hitech and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could result in material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

general risk factors 

the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the company could compromise data security thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations 

our business is highly dependent upon the internet thirdparty service providers and information systems to operate in an efficient and resilient manner we gather and maintain data for the purpose of conducting marketing actuarial analysis sales and policy administration functions 

malicious thirdparties employee or agent errors or disasters affecting our information systems could impair our business operations regulatory compliance and financial condition employee or agent malfeasance or errors in the handling of our information systems may result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information or an inability to use our information systems to efficiently support business operations 

more frequent and sophisticated cyberattacks and more impactful regulatory oversight models could result in additional costs to protect against security breaches any breach of confidential information systems resulting from the above factors could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter potential customers from purchasing our products result in the loss of existing customers subject us to significant civil and criminal liability constrain cash flows or require us to incur significant technical legal or other expenses 

the failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information technology systems and infrastructure could adversely affect our business 

our ability to modernize our information technology systems and infrastructure requires us to commit to significant resources effective planning and execution in addition due to the highly regulated nature of the insurance industry we must continually implement new technology or adapt existing technology to meet compliance requirements of new and proposed regulations should we be unable to implement these innovations effectively efficiently or in a timely manner it could result in poor customer experience additional expenses reputational harm legal and regulatory actions and other adverse consequences this could also result in the inability to effectively support business operations 

damage to the brand and reputation of globe life or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business 

negative publicity through traditional media internet social media and other public forums could damage our brand or reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts the ability to market our products and the persistency of inforce policies the company could be subjected to adverse publicity in the event of a significant security breach

summary of operations net income increased 2 to 745 million in 2021 compared with 732 million in 2020 this increase was primarily related to an increase in realized gains offset by higher covid19 life claims  on a diluted per common share basis net income per common share for 2021 increased from 682 to 722 included in net income were aftertax realized gains of 47 million in 2021 compared with realized aftertax losses of 2 million for 2020 realized gains and losses are presented more fully under the caption realized gains and losses in this report 

net operating income from continuing operations declined 4 to 707 million in 2021 compared with 738 million in 2020 on a diluted per common share basis net operating income per common share decreased slightly from 688 to 686 net operating income is the consolidated total of segment profits after tax and as such is considered a nongaap measure net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments additionally net income was affected by certain significant and unusual nonoperating items in 2020 and 2021 we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are nonoperating items when evaluating the results of current operations and therefore exclude such items from our segment analysis for current periods 

despite headwinds with covid19 the company continues to see positive signs in its core operations including strong sales favorable persistency and a strong roe excluding net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio 

covid19 for the year ended december 31 2021 the company incurred 140 million of covid19 net life claims per the centers for disease control and prevention cdc there were approximately 460 thousand us covid19 deaths in 2021 in the second half of the year the covid19 deaths were concentrated in geographies and younger age groups where the company has greater risk exposure the company’s level of covid19 net life claims on average for the year was approximately 3 million per 10000 us deaths 

going forward we anticipate that covid19 deaths will continue at elevated levels throughout 2022 with an impact of approximately 50 million at the midpoint of our guidance based on incurred claims in the range of 3 million to 4 million per 10000 us deaths the projected life claims are dependent on this estimate and many other variables including but not limited to projected us deaths from covid19 the timing and availability of effective treatments for the disease vaccination rates and effectiveness of vaccines impact from potential variants and the ages and geographic areas in which infections and deaths occur

the discussions of our segments are presented in the manner we view our operations as described in note 14—business segments  

  

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” 

• annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue 

• net sales a statistical performance measure is calculated as annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of direct to consumer where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired management considers net sales to be a better indicator of the rate of premium growth than annualized premium issued 

• firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future

a discussion of life operations by distribution channel follows 

the american income life division markets to members of labor unions and continues to diversify its lead sources by building relationships with other affinity groups utilizing thirdparty internet vendor leads and obtaining referrals to facilitate sustainable growth this division is globe lifes largest contributor of life premium of any distribution channel at 48 of the companys 2021 total life premium net sales increased 15 to 291 million in 2021 over the 2020 total of 253 million the increase in net life sales is due to increased productivity and well as an increase in agent count premium increased 12 primarily due to improved persistency and higher sales the underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 30 for the year ended december 31 2021 down from 32 from the prior year primarily due to higher covid19 claims and higher reserve increases from lower policy lapse rates 

this division incurred 36 million in covid19 net life claims representing approximately 3 of premium for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with 18 million in covid19 net life claims during the prior year 

below is the average producing agent count at the end of the period for the american income life division the average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the year the division continues to see a significant recruiting opportunity due to the current economic conditions and our ability to recruit virtually and inperson sales growth in our exclusive agencies is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force 



american income life continues to focus on growing and strengthening the agency force specifically through emphasis on agency middlemanagement growth and additional agency office openings in addition to offering financial incentives and training opportunities the agency has made considerable investments in information technology including a customer relationship management crm tool for the agency force this tool is designed to drive productivity in lead distribution conservation of business manager dashboards and new agent recruiting additionally this division has invested in and successfully implemented technology that allows the agency force to engage in virtual recruiting training and sales activity over the past year and through the pandemic the agents have shifted to primarily a virtual experience with the customers and have generated a vast majority of its sales through virtual presentations we find this flexibility to be enticing for new recruits as well as a driver of sustainability for our agency force 

the direct to consumer division dtc offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of marketing approaches including direct mailings insert media and electronic media in recent years production from electronic media which is comprised of sales through both the internet and inbound phone calls to our call center has grown rapidly compared with direct mail response as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology as well as focused on driving traffic to our inbound call center this had been steadily increasing prior to covid19 but the pandemic accelerated this activity due in part to the awareness of needing life insurance from the effects of covid19 the different approaches support and complement one another in the divisions efforts to reach the consumer the dtcs longterm growth has been fueled by constant innovation and name recognition we continually introduce new initiatives in this division in an attempt to increase response rates 

while the juvenile market is an important source of sales it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders who are more likely to respond favorably to a dtc solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 

the dtc division continued to see high demand of its life insurance products in the current year primarily through its internet and inbound phone channels as a result of the response from covid19 our continued investments in technology have allowed us to successfully serve the higher demands for our products through the digital selfserve and phone channels

dtc net sales decreased 10 to 149 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with 165 million in the prior year primarily due to the record high net life sales in the prior year at the onset of the pandemic we expect continued strong sales in 2022 due to the heightened awareness as to the benefits of life insurance 

dtc incurred 69 million of covid19 net life claims representing approximately 7 of premium in 2021 compared with 35 million in 2020 dtc’s underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 7 for the year ended december 31 2021 which was lower than the 14 result in 2020 primarily due to higher covid19 net life claims in 2021 

the liberty national division markets individual life insurance to middleincome household and worksite customers recent investments in new sales technologies as well as recent growth in middle management within the agency will help continue this growth the underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 17 down from 23 for the year ended 2020 the decrease is primarily attributable to higher than normal policy obligations during 2021 as a result of covid19 this division incurred 28 million of covid19 net life claims representing approximately 9 of premium for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with 12 million in 2020 net sales increased 30 in 2021 over 2020 with the divisions ability to return to facetoface customer interaction and the option of virtual sales total net life sales increased for the full year 2021 however due to higher policy obligations as result of covid19 underwriting margin as a percent of premium was lower for the full year 2021 as compared with 2020 

below is the average producing agent count at the end of the period for liberty national division as the division continues to gain momentum in its sales and recruiting initiatives and advances its technology and crm platform the agency should see an increase in recruiting of new agents and an increase in the average producing agent count 



the liberty national division average producing agent count increased 5 in 2021 we continue to execute our longterm plan to grow this agency through expansion from smalltown markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers continued expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated lesspenetrated areas will help create longterm agency growth additionally the agency continues to help improve the ability of agents to develop new worksite marketing business systems that have been put in place including the addition of a crm platform and enhanced analytical capabilities have helped the agents develop additional worksite marketing opportunities as well as improve the productivity of agents selling in the individual life market

health insurance 

health insurance sold by the company primarily includes medicare supplement insurance accident coverage and other limitedbenefit supplemental health products including cancer critical illness heart and intensive care coverage

the united american independent agency consists of nonexclusive independent agencies who may also sell for other companies the united american independent agency was globe lifes largest health agency in terms of health premium income 

this division is also globe lifes largest producer of medicare supplement insurance responsible for 82 of the companys medicare supplement premium and 95 of medicare supplement net sales medicare supplement premium in this agency rose 4 to 460 million in 2021 over the prior period net sales of 443 million medicare supplement net sales increased 2 to 63 million in 2021 from the prior year the medicare supplement market is highly competitive and thus sales will fluctuate over the years underwriting margin as a percent of premium was flat at 15 for 2021 compared with 2020

the family heritage division primarily markets limitedbenefit supplemental health insurance in nonurban areas most of its policies include a cashback feature such as a return of premium where any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 27 up from 26 for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was primarily attributable to favorable claims experience 

the division experienced a 3 increase in net health sales in 2021 as compared with the 2020 primarily due to an increase in agent productivity and training the division will continue to launch incentive programs to help drive an increase in productivity and the number of producing agents 

below is the average producing agent count at the end of the indicated periods for the family heritage division while the agency has seen a decrease in agent count as compared with 2020 we anticipate that as covid19 and the job market stabilize agent recruitment opportunities should increase 



the liberty national division represented 16 of all globe life health premium income at 187 million in 2021 liberty national markets limitedbenefit supplemental health products consisting primarily of critical illness insurance much of liberty national’s health business is generated through worksite marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 100 employees in 2021 health premium income declined 1 liberty nationals firstyear collected premium increased 1 to 203 million in 2021 compared with 202 million in 2020 health net sales for 2021 increased by 4 million or 16 from 2020 we anticipate an increase in net health sales going forward at this division as the company becomes more able to interact facetoface with customers 

other distribution while some of the companys other distribution channels market health products selling life insurance is the main emphasis on a combined basis they accounted for 15 of health premium in 2021 and 16 in 2020 the american income life division primarily markets accident plans the direct to consumer division markets primarily medicare supplements to employer or unionsponsored groups adding 3 million of medicare supplement net sales in 2021 and 4 million in 2020

investments 

we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14—business segments  it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest on net insurance policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” 

management also views excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used 87 billion of excess cash flow at the parent company to repurchase globe life inc common shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater risk adjusted aftertax return than other investment alternatives if we had not used this excess cash to repurchase shares but had instead invested it in interestbearing assets we would have earned more investment income and had more shares outstanding as excess investment income per diluted common share incorporates all capital resources we view excess investment income per diluted common share as a useful measure to evaluate the investment segment

net investment income increased at a compound annual growth rate of 3 over the 3 years ending 2021 while mean invested assets increased at a compound rate of 5 during the same period the tax equivalent effective annual yield rate earned on the fixed maturity portfolio was 521 in 2021 growth in net investment income has been negatively impacted in recent years by the low interest rate environment during which time we have invested new money at yields lower than our average portfolio yield in addition we have reinvested the proceeds from bonds that matured were called or were otherwise disposed of at yield rates less than the yield earned on these disposed bonds we currently expect that the average annual turnover rate of fixed maturity assets will be less than 2 over the next five years and will not have a material negative impact on net investment income in addition to fixed maturities the company has also invested in limited partnerships with debt like characteristics that diversify risk and enhance riskadjusted capitaladjusted returns on the portfolio the earned yield on the investment funds for the year ended december 31 2021 was 524 see additional information in note 4—investments  the following chart presents the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets 



should the current low interest rate environment continue the growth of the companys net investment income will be negatively impacted primarily due to the investment of new money and proceeds from dispositions at rates less than the average portfolio yield rate while net investment income would grow it would continue to grow at rates less than the growth in mean invested assets 

should interest rates especially longterm rates rise globe lifes net investment income would benefit due to higher interest rates on new investments while such a rise in interest rates could adversely affect the fair value of the fixed maturities portfolio we could withstand an increase in interest rates of approximately 140 to 145 basis points before the net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio as of december 31 2021 would be eliminated should interest rates increase further we would not be concerned with potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio because we do not intend to sell nor is it likely that management will be required to sell the fixed maturities prior to their anticipated recovery 

required interest on net insurance policy liabilities reduces net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to “fund” required interest on net insurance policy liabilities which is the net of the benefit reserve liability and the deferred acquisition cost asset as such it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments as discussed in note 14—business segments management regards this as a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force 

the great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest rate protection policies not investment products and are accounted for under current gaap accounting guidance for longduration insurance products which mandate that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business each calendar year we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year and cannot be changed the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in as such the overall discount rate for the entire in force block of 58 is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years changes in the overall weightedaverage discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weightedaverage discount rate due to the size of our in force business 

since actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs due to the

financing costs for the investment segment consist primarily of interest on our various debt instruments the table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations  

analysis of financing costs 

dollar amounts in thousands 

  

in 2021 financing costs decreased 4 compared with prior year primarily due to rates on the shortterm debt the interest on funded debt was higher than the prior year as a result of the 215 senior note issued in august 2020 more information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the financial condition section of this report and in note 11—debt  

realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future since benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

despite our intent to hold fixed maturity investments for a long period of time investments are occasionally sold exchanged called or experience a credit loss event resulting in a realized gain or loss these sales are often in response to deterioration in credit quality of the issuer in effort to maximize riskadjusted capitaladjusted returns we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders in a bond exchange offer bondholders may consent to exchange their existing bonds for another class of debt securities the company also has investments in certain limited partnerships held under the fair value option with fair value changes recognized in realized gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations  

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause periodtoperiod trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

investment acquisitions  globe lifes investment policy calls for investing primarily in investment grade fixed maturities that meet our quality and yield objectives we generally invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities we believe this strategy is appropriate since our expected future cash flows are generally stable and predictable and the likelihood that we will need to sell invested assets to raise cash is low 

during calendar years 2019 through 2021 globe life invested predominately in fixed maturity securities primarily in corporate and municipal bonds with longerterm maturities the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity investments the effective annual yield shown is based on the acquisition price and call features if any of the securities for noncallable bonds the yield is calculated to maturity date for callable bonds acquired at a premium the yield is calculated to the earliest known call date and call price after acquisition first call date for all other callable bonds the yield is calculated to maturity date

for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment absent sales and makewhole calls however the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 

  

during 2020 and 2021 acquisitions consisted of securities spanning a diversified range of issuers industry sectors and geographical regions all of the acquired securities were investment grade in addition to the fixed maturity acquisitions globe life invested 258 million in other longterm investments in 2021 and 266 million in 2020 these investments include primarily investment funds see note—4 for further discussion 

new cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations cash received on existing investments and proceeds from dispositions while dispositions increase funds available for investment as noted earlier in this discussion they can also have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the dispositions are reinvested at lower yields than the bonds that were disposed dispositions were 428 million in 2021 and 469 million in 2020

losses were 12 of our shareholders’ equity excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities as of december 31 2021 globe life invests long term and as such one of our key criterion in our investment process is to select issuers that have the ability to weather multiple financial cycles 

market risk sensitivity globe lifes investment securities are exposed to interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since 94 of the carrying value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments and these investments are predominately fixedrate investments the portfolio is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio rising and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline under normal market conditions we are not concerned about unrealized losses that are interest rate driven since we would not expect to realize them globe life does not intend to sell the securities prior to maturity and likely will not be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of amortized cost the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong operating cashflow substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however as is permitted by gaap these liabilities are not recorded at fair value 

  

the following table illustrates the interest rate risk sensitivity of our fixed maturity portfolio at december 31 2021 and 2020 this table measures the effect of a parallel shift in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points

operating expenses 

operating expenses are included in the corporate and other segment and are classified into two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company insurance administrative expenses generally include expenses incurred after a policy has been issued as these expenses relate to premium for a given period management measures the expenses as a percentage of premium income the company also views stockbased compensation expense as a parent company expense expenses associated with the issuance of our insurance policies are reflected as acquisition expenses and included in the determination of underwriting margin

total operating expenses increased 7 over the prior year period primarily due to an 8 increase in insurance administrative expenses insurance administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher employeerelated expenses including pension costs and information technology salaries pension expense increased due to the lower discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit costs in 2021 as compared to 2020 the decrease in stockbased compensation expense was primarily due to fewer performance based equity awards in 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 insurance administrative expenses as a percent of premium were in line with 2020

share repurchases 

globe life has an ongoing share repurchase program that began in 1986 and is reviewed with the board of directors by management quarterly and annually reaffirmed by the board of directors with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the excess cash flow at the parent company general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess cash flow excess cash flow at the parent company is primarily comprised of dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries less interest expense paid on its debt dividends paid to parent company shareholders and other limited operating activities additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the resulting tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises on august 4 2021 the board of directors reauthorized the parent company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management in consultation with the board determines to be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders

liquidity liquidity provides globe life with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required to support our business operations and meet our financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from multiple sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities a revolving credit facility commercial paper and federal home loan bank fhlb 

insurance subsidiary liquidity  the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs cash inflows for the insurance subsidiaries primarily include premium and investment income in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are cash inflows cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes a portion of the excess cash inflows in the current year will provide for the payment of future policy benefits and are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities as they better match the longterm nature of these obligations excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restrictions the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains while the leading source of the excess cash is investment income a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control while the insurance subsidiaries routinely generate more operating cash inflows than cash outflows annually the companies also have the entire availableforsale fixed maturity investment portfolio available to create additional cash flows if required 

during the year four of our insurance subsidiaries became members of the fhlb of dallas fhlb membership provides the insurance subsidiaries with access to various low cost collateralized borrowings and funding agreements while not a primary source of liquidity the fhlb could provide the insurance subsidiaries with an additional source of liquidity if needed refer to note 11—debt for further details

parent company liquidity an important source of parent company liquidity is the dividends from its insurance subsidiaries these dividends are received throughout the year and are used by the parent company to pay dividends on common and preferred stock interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt and operating expenses of the parent company 



for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 12—shareholders equity although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company 

additional sources of liquidity for the parent company are cash intercompany receivables intercompany borrowings public debt markets term loans and a revolving credit facility at december 31 2021 the parent company had access to 119 million of invested cash net intercompany receivables and other liquid assets the credit facility is discussed below 

shortterm borrowings an additional source of parent company liquidity is a revolving credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 750 million which could be extended up to 1 billion while globe life can request the extension it is not guaranteed up to 250 million in letters of credit can be issued against the facility the facility is further designated as a backup line of credit for a commercial paper program under which commercial paper may be issued at any time with total commercial paper outstanding not to exceed the facility maximum less any letters of credit issued as of december 31 2021 we had available 295 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility compared with 360 million a year earlier interest charged on the commercial paper program resembles variable rate debt due to its short term nature globe life has consistently been able to issue commercial paper as needed during the three years ended december 31 2021 as discussed in note 11—debt  on september 30 2021 globe life amended the credit agreement dated august 24 2020 the fiveyear credit agreement will now mature on september 30 2026 as of december 31 2021 the parent company was in full compliance with all covenants related to the aforementioned debt 

as a part of the credit facility globe life has standby letters of credits these letters are issued among our subsidiaries one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer and have no impact on company obligations as a whole any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of offshore captive reinsurers might require globe life to obtain thirdparty financing which could cause an insignificant increase in financing costs on october 26 2021 the letters of credit were amended to reduce the amount outstanding from 135 million as of december 31 2020 to 125 million at december 31 2021 

  

the parent company expects to have readily available funds for 2022 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of debt an additional shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing refer to n ote 6— commitments and contingencies and the discussion surrounding the companys obligations over the next five years 

as noted above the parent company had access to 119 million of liquid assets available as of december 31 2021 this liquidity is available to the company in the event additional funds are needed to support the targeted capital levels within our insurance subsidiaries due to adverse impacts of covid19 

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from continuing operations were 144 billion in 2021 compared with 148 billion in 2020 in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies received proceeds from maturities calls and repayments of fixed maturities in the amount of 311 million in 2021 compared

cash and shortterm investments were 161 million at the end of 2021 compared with 203 million at the end of 2020 in addition to these liquid assets the entire 213 billion fair value at december 31 2021 portfolio of fixed income securities is available for sale in the event of an unexpected need approximately 97 of our fixed income securities are publicly traded freely tradable under sec rule 144 or qualified for resale under sec rule 144a we generally expect to hold fixed income securities to maturity and even though these securities are classified as available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold any securities until recovery or maturity our strong cash flows from operations ongoing investment maturities and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity highly unlikely 

capital resources the parent companys capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility and current maturities of longterm debt  longterm debt and shareholders’ equity 

debt the carrying value of the longterm debt was 15 billion at december 31 2021 which decreased from 17 billion a year earlier a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 11—debt  

subsidiary capital  the national association of insurance commissioners naic has established a riskbased factor approach for determining threshold riskbased capital levels for all insurance companies this approach was designed to assist the regulatory bodies in identifying companies that may require regulatory attention a riskbased capital rbc ratio is typically determined by dividing adjusted total statutory capital by the amount of riskbased capital determined using the naic’s factors if a company’s rbc ratio approaches two times the rbc amount the company must file a plan with the naic for improving their capital levels this level is commonly referred to as “company action level” rbc companies typically hold a multiple of the company action level rbc depending on their particular business needs and risk profile 

our goal is to maintain statutory capital within our insurance subsidiaries at levels necessary to support our current ratings for 2021 globe life has targeted a consolidated company action level rbc ratio of 300 to 320 the company concludes that this capital level is more than adequate and sufficient to support its current ratings given the nature of its business and its risk profile as of december 31 2021 our consolidated company action level rbc ratio was 315 compared with 309 in prior year 

in august 2021 the naic fully adopted new and expanded c1 investment factors the adoption of these factors resulted in higher amounts of required capital related to our investment portfolio in addition to the expanded c1 factors additional capital was needed by the end of the year to support higher sales levels growth of our inforce business higher covid19 net life claims and the acquisition of beazley benefits the parent company is committed to maintaining the targeted consolidated rbc ratio at its insurance subsidiaries and has sufficient liquidity available to provide additional capital if necessary

we plan to use excess cash available at the parent company as efficiently as possible in the future possible uses of excess cash flow include but are not limited to share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in securities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that targeted capital levels are maintained in our insurance subsidiaries if market conditions are favorable we currently expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds 

as discussed in note 1—significant accounting policies  the company will adopt asu 201812 financial services–insurance topic 944 targeted improvements to the accounting for longduration contracts ldti  effective on january 1 2023 the accounting adoption will have no economic impact on the cash flows of our business nor influence our business model of providing basic protection oriented products to the underserved and low to middleincome market in addition the adoption will not impact our capital management philosophies it will however modify the timing of when profits emerge on our insurance policies we are anticipating gaap net income and net operating income to increase under the new standard primarily due to the significant reduction in dac amortization in the near or intermediate term with respect to equity we anticipate a significant decrease as a result of the requirement to use current discount rates to remeasure the policy liabilities and record the offset through aoci at adoption since current rates uppermedium grade are lower than the lockedin rates assumed in valuing our policy liabilities we will have unrealized interest rate loss recognized through aoci 

we maintain a significant availableforsale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policy liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in market rates 

while a majority of invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity an inconsistency exists in measurement which may have a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios due to the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by market rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios

critical accounting policies 

application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment management reviews these key estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements on a timely basis if management determines that modifications are necessary due to current facts and circumstances the company’s results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could possibly change significantly 

the following accounting policies are deemed critical to the preparation of the financial statements and include accounting estimates that management believes are most subjective or have complex judgments 

  

future policy benefits due to the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies  

  

approximately 90 of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2021 were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies under the caption future policy benefits otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the consolidated financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

refer to note 1—significant accounting policies for discussion on the significant changes to future policy benefits with an effective date of january 1 2023 

  

deferred acquisition costs certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs such as advertising related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note 1—significant accounting policies under the caption deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements additionally the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies known as the value of insurance acquired voba is included in deferred acquisition costs our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1—significant accounting policies  

  

over 99 of our deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2021 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2021

less than 1 of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made the company concludes that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience there were no significant changes in the claims process in the current year 

valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time to maximize riskadjusted capitaladjusted returns we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio and the long average life small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report the company regards these unrealized fluctuations in value as having no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

at times the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening and accordingly to unrealized losses on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in note 1—significant accounting policies and in note 4—investments under the captions fair value measurements in both notes there were no significant changes in the valuation process in the current year 

investments allowance for credit losses we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value to determine if a credit loss event has occurred when a credit event does occur an allowance for credit loss is recorded and the corresponding provision is recognized in the consolidated income statement in realized gains or losses noncredit related fluctuations in the fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income  the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for allowance for credit losses are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an allowance for credit loss it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security

defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plan covering a limited number of officers our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2021 our gross liability under these plans was 779 million but was offset by assets of 598 million 

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligationsexpenses for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled additionally a corridor approach is used to amortize any unrecognized gains or losses outside the corridor the standard 10 of the greater of plan pbo and fair value assets and have an amortization service period of approximately nine years these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans for example a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2021 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2021

the criteria used to determine the primary assumptions are discussed in note 9—postretirement benefits while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to us note 9—postretirement benefits also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies and other related data there were no significant changes in the assumptions in the current year

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income in excess of the amounts required for policy reserves

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each globe life insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information obtained from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants including but not limited to inspection reports pharmacy data doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in globe lifes consolidated financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health insurance policies written by globe lifes insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis the assumptions used in the calculation of globe lifes reserves are reported in note 1—significant accounting policies  reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

reinsurance 

globe life has historically participated in very limited thirdparty reinsurance contracts as a result of the low face amounts of the policies sold by the company see schedule iv and note 6—commitments and contingencies for more information 

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of globe life insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities approximately 95 of our invested assets at fair value are fixed maturities at december 31 2020 see note 4—investments and management’s discussion and analysis  

competition 

  

globe life competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with globe life no individual company dominates any of globe lifes life or health insurance markets 

  

globe lifes health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

the company effectively competes with other carriers in part due to its ability to operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows globe life to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins

guaranty assessments —state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is based on its proportional share of the premium in each state a significant portion of assessments are recoverable as offsets against state premium taxes

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

the insurance industry is a regulated industry populated by many public and private companies we operate in the industrys life and health insurance sectors each of which has its own set of risks 

business and operational risks 

the development and maintenance of our various distribution channels are critical to growth in product sales and profits 

recruiting development and retention of producing agents are critical to support sales growth in this market because our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals and the face amounts of the life insurance policies sold are typically lower than those of policies sold in higherincome markets if we do not provide compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that motivates producing agents to increase sales of our products our growth could be impeded in addition a failure to effectively develop new methods of reaching consumers and realizing cost efficiencies in our direct to consumer division business could result in reduced sales and profits 

our life insurance products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish 

we have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches two of which are labor unions and sales via direct to consumer solicitations deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to direct to consumer marketing initiatives could negatively affect our life insurance business 

the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the company could compromise data security thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations 

our business is highly dependent upon the internet thirdparty service providers and information systems to operate in an efficient and resilient manner we gather and maintain data for the purpose of conducting marketing actuarial analysis sales and policy administration functions 

malicious thirdparties employee or agent errors or disasters affecting our information systems could impair our business operations regulatory compliance and financial condition employee or agent errors in the handling of our information systems may inadvertently result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information or an inability to use our information systems to efficiently support business operations 

more frequent and sophisticated cyberattacks and more impactful regulatory oversight models could result in additional costs to protect against security breaches any breach of confidential information systems resulting from the above factors could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter potential customers from purchasing our products result in the loss of existing customers subject us to significant civil and criminal liability constrain cash flows or require us to incur significant technical legal or other expenses 

the impact of covid19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations financial position andor liquidity 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic and us and international responses are wideranging costly disruptive and rapidly changing the global covid19 pandemic has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in significant disruptions in economic activity and financial markets covid19 has directly and indirectly adversely affected the company and will likely continue to do so for an uncertain period of time because of the size and breadth of this pandemic and the impact of related government and regulatory actions all of the direct and indirect consequences of covid19 on the company are not yet known and may not emerge for some time 

gl 2020 form 10k 

table of contents 

the covid19 pandemic subjects the company to various potential risks that could adversely affect the company in different ways including but not limited to the following 

• reduced sales resulting from potential limitations in the virtual sales and agent recruiting process or reductions in the willingness or ability of consumers to purchase our products 

• reduced cash flows from higher surrenders and claim payments or greater than anticipated losses from higher policyholder claims 

• disruptions delays and increased costs and risks related to employees working remotely having limited or no access to our facilities and experiencing reductions or interruptions of critical or essential services 

• ratings downgrades increased bankruptcies and credit spread widening in industries in which we invest in our investment portfolio 

actual or alleged misclassification of independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries could result in adverse legal tax or financial consequences 

a significant portion of our sales agents are independent contractors although we believe we have properly classified such individuals a risk nevertheless exists that a court the internal revenue service or other authority will take the position that those sales agents are employees the laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of workers are subject to change and differing interpretations which we cannot predict 

if there is an adverse determination regarding the classification of some or all of the independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries by a court or governmental agency we could incur significant costs with respect to payroll tax liabilities employee benefits wage payments fines judgments andor legal settlements any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any resulting reclassification could necessitate significant changes in our affected insurance subsidiaries’ business models 

financial and strategic risks 

our investments are subject to market and credit risks significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses 

our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values our investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed maturity and shortterm investments where we are exposed to the risk that individual issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments a concentration of these investments in any particular issuer industry group of related industries or geographic areas could increase this risk factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels consisting of both treasury rate and credit spread financial market performance disruptions in credit markets general economic conditions legislative changes particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control 

additionally as the majority of our investments are longterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity a significant increase in interest rates or a market downturn could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses could substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses could experience a credit event where an allowance for credit loss is recorded reducing net income 

  

we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all significant downgrades or defaults of issuers could negatively impact our riskbased capital ratios leading to potential downgrades of the company by rating agencies potential reduction in future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries andor higher financing costs at the parent company should additional statutory capital be required 

  

changes in interest rates could negatively affect income  

declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate net policy liabilities which 

gl 2020 form 10k 

table of contents 

could have a negative impact on income significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers any such calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower interest rates 

an increase in interest rates could result in certain policyholders surrendering their life or annuity policies for cash thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate invested assets if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations in such a case realized losses could result from the sale of the invested assets and could adversely affect our statutory income required capital levels and results of operations 

our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on available funds from our insurance subsidiaries 

as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity include a variety of shortterm and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper longterm debt intercompany financing and reinsurance 

the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on regulations by their states of domicile accordingly impairments in assets or disruptions in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduce their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow the payment of dividends a principal source of our cash flow to us 

  

changes in laws or regulations in the states in which our companies are domiciled could constrain the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to pay our debt obligations corporate expenses or dividends on our capital stock 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital 

should interest rates increase in the future the higher interest expense on any new issued debt may reduce net income in addition if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions could limit our ability to replace maturing debt obligations in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability and cost of additional financing or capital depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we would prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility if so our results of operations financial condition consolidated rbc and cash flows could be materially negatively affected

industry risks 

variations in actualtoexpected rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we establish policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models and accounting requirements that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test actualtoexpected results actual results may differ significantly from the levels assumed which could result in increased policy obligations and expenses and thus negatively affect our profit margins and income 

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us by limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and reducing our sales by adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through independent insurance agencies 

the supplemental health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny 

regulatory changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health business the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our supplemental health insurance business 

obtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain supplemental health insurance policies is critical 

a significant percentage of the supplemental health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance including conditions under which the premiums for such policies may be increased is highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result our medicare supplement business is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success since medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are typically necessary accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of appropriate premium rate increases for supplemental health insurance plans in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus our business financial condition and results of operations 

damage to the reputation of globe life or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business 

negative publicity through traditional media internet social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts the ability to market our products and the persistency of inforce policies the company could be subjected to adverse publicity as a result of a significant security breach 

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events 

our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a pandemic hurricane earthquake or manmade catastrophes including acts of terrorism or war which may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility

the following graphs represent net income and net operating income from continuing operations for the three years ended december 31 2020 

1 net operating income is the consolidated total of segment profits after tax and as such is considered a nongaap measure it has been used consistently by globe lifes management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the company it differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain nonoperating items such as realized gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure 

net operating income as an roe excluding net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio is considered a nongaap measure management utilizes this measure to view the business without the effect of the net unrealized gains which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates on the availableforsale portfolio the impact of the adjustment to exclude net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 32 billion and 20 billion for 2020 and 2019 respectively 

book value per share excluding net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio is also considered a nongaap measure management utilizes this measure to view the book value of the business without the effect of net unrealized gains which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates on the available for sale portfolio the impact of the adjustment to exclude net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 3007 and 1776 for 2020 and 2019 respectively

covid19 with respect to the impact of covid19 on our underwriting results for the full year 2020 we estimate 67 million of covid19 life claims were incurred at the midpoint of our 2021 guidance we are now projecting approximately 52 million of additional life claims will be incurred in 2021 based on an estimate of approximately 270000 us deaths this estimate of us deaths is based on various thirdparty models the projected additional life claims are dependent on this estimate and many other variables including but not limited to the effect of efforts to reopen the economy the timing and availability of effective treatments for the disease and the actual ages and states in which infections and deaths occur 

summary of operations net income declined 4 to 732 million in 2020 compared with 761 million in 2019 this decrease was primarily related to covid19 life claims  on a diluted per common share basis net income per common share for 2020 decreased slightly from 683 to 682 included in net income were aftertax realized losses of 2 million in 2020 compared with realized aftertax gains of 16 million for 2019 realized gains and losses are presented more fully under the caption realized gains and losses in this report

managements discussion  analysis 

a discussion of each of globe lifes segments follows a significant factor in the performance of our various segments has been the impact of covid19 in response to this crisis our crisis management and incident response teams successfully guided the company into a smooth transition of working remotely we quickly transitioned those employees whose jobs did not require them to be in the office averaging approximately 8085 of the companys total workforce to working remotely the company has continued to operate effectively while taking steps to help ensure the health and safety of our employees through adherence to the cdc and local government work guidelines 

with over 13 thousand exclusive agents in the field the company was presented with a challenge to move from facetoface sales presentations in customers homes and businesses to a virtual sales process despite its challenges the companys agencies also had to move from inperson recruiting and training of new agents to virtual processes the companys exclusive agency divisions were able to quickly pivot and continue to write new business and hire new agents due in part to new and updated information technology systems put in place over the last several years through the year ended december 31 2020 the company has seen a 28 increase in agent count at american income and a 14 increase at family heritage compared with the prior year comparable period 

our direct to consumer division continues to experience record high demand for its products through its internet and inbound phone call channels with a 31 increase in overall net life sales for year ended december 31 2020 compared with the prior year comparable period the company believes that times of crisis highlight the need for basic life protection and this has proven true with this pandemic 

the discussions of our segments are presented in the manner we view our operations as described in note 14—business segments  

  

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” 

• annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue 

• net sales is annualized premium issued gross premium that would be received during the policies first year in force and assuming that none of the policies lapsed or terminated net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of our direct to consumer division for dtc net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired management considers net sales to be a better indicator of the rate of premium growth as compared with annualized premium issued 

• firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

while it is difficult to predict sales activity in this uncertain environment the company is expecting net life and health sales to increase 7 for the full year 2021 due to the strength of the companys policies in force we expect our total life and health premiums to grow around 6 for the full year 2021 see further discussion of the distribution channels below for life and health

a discussion of life operations by distribution channel follows 

the american income life division markets to members of labor unions and continues to diversify its lead sources by building relationships with other affinity groups utilizing thirdparty internet vendor leads and obtaining referrals to facilitate sustainable growth this division is globe lifes largest contributor to life premium of any distribution channel at 47 of the companys 2020 total net sales increased 7 to 253 million in 2020 over the 2019 total of 238 million the underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 32 for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 down from 34 from the prior year primarily due to 18 million of estimated incurred claims related to covid19 as well as elevated claims for other causes sales growth in our exclusive agencies is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force 

below is the average producing agent count at the end of the period for the american income life division the average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the year the division continues to see a significant recruiting opportunity due to the current economic conditions and our ability to recruit virtually and inperson 



american income continues to focus on growing and strengthening the agency force specifically through additional agency office openings and focus on middlemanagement growth in addition to offering financial incentives and training opportunities the agency has made considerable investments in information technology including launching a lead mapping and customer relationship management tool for the agency force we anticipate this tool will help enhance agent productivity and agent retention additionally this division has invested in and successfully implemented technology that allows the agency force to engage in virtual recruiting training and sales activity 

the direct to consumer division dtc offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of marketing approaches including direct mailings insert media and electronic media in recent years production from electronic media which is comprised of sales through both the internet and inbound phone calls to our call center has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology as well as focused on driving traffic to our inbound call center the different approaches support and complement one another in the divisions efforts to reach the consumer the dtcs longterm growth has been fueled by constant innovation and name recognition we continually introduce new initiatives in this division in an attempt to increase response rates 

while the juvenile market is an important source of sales it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders who are more likely to respond favorably to a dtc solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 

the dtc division saw record high demand of its life insurance products in the current year primarily through its internet and inbound phone channels as a result of the response from covid19 our continued investments in technology have allowed us to successfully serve the higher demands for our products through the digital selfserve and phone channels 

dtc’s underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 14 for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 which was lower than the 18 result during the same period in 2019 primarily due to 35 million of estimated incurred claims related to covid19 as well as elevated claims for other causes in 2021 we are anticipating additional covid19 life claims at the dtc division

the liberty national division markets individual life insurance to middleincome household and worksite customers recent investments in new sales technologies as well as recent growth in middle management within the agency will help continue this growth the underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 23 down from 26 for the year ended 2019 the decrease is primarily attributable to higher than normal policy obligations during 2020 as a result of covid19 net sales increased 2 in 2020 over 2019 

below is the average producing agent count at the end of the period for liberty national division as the division gains momentum in the virtual sales environment the agency will benefit from the abundant recruiting opportunities currently available for new agents 



the liberty national division average producing agent count increased 10 in 2020 we continue to execute our long term plan to grow this agency through expansion from smalltown markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers continued expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated lesspenetrated areas will help create longterm agency growth additionally the agency continues to help improve the ability of agents to develop new worksite marketing business systems that have been put in place including the addition of a customer relationship management crm platform and enhanced analytical capabilities have helped the agents develop additional worksite marketing opportunities as well as improve the productivity of agents selling in the individual life market sales were hindered in the first half of the year due to difficulties in agents transitioning to a virtual work environment after the onset of the covid19 lockdown as well as mandatory shutdowns of nonessential small businesses which hindered the ability of the division’s agents to prospect at the worksite in the second half of the year sales improved in the worksite market as businesses were able to reopen 

the other agencies distribution channels primarily include nonexclusive independent agencies selling predominantly life insurance the other agencies contributed 214 million of life premium income or 8 of globe lifes total in 2020 but contrib uted only 2 of net sales for the year 

health insurance 

health insurance sold by the company includes primarily medicare supplement insurance accident coverage and other limitedbenefit supplemental health products including cancer critical illness heart and intensive care coverage 

yeartodate health premium accounted for 30 of our total premium in 2020 while the health underwriting margin accounted for 28 of total underwriting margin reflective of the lower underwriting margin as a percent of premium for health compared with life insurance the company continues to emphasize life insurance sales relative to health due to life’s superior profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income

a discussion of health operations by distribution channel follows 

the united american independent agency consists of nonexclusive independent agencies who may also sell for other companies the united american independent agency was globe lifes largest health agency in terms of health premium income 

this division is also globe lifes largest producer of medicare supplement insurance the united american independent agency represents 80 of all medicare supplement premium and 94 of medicare supplement net sales medicare supplement premium in this agency rose 9 to 443 million in 2020 over the prior period net sales of 406 million medicare supplement net sales declined 22 to 61 million in 2020 from the prior year the medicare supplement market is highly competitive and thus sales will fluctuate over the years underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 15 up from 14 for the prior year primarily due to lower nondeferred commissions and amortization of deferred acquisition costs as a percentage of premium in 2020 compared with 2019

the family heritage division primarily markets limitedbenefit supplemental health insurance in nonurban areas most of its policies include a cashback feature such as a return of premium where any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 26 up from 25 for the year ended december 31 2019 the increase was primarily attributable to improved persistency and lower acquisition expenses as a percent of premium compared with the prior year a focused effort across the division for increased recruiting activity along with a targeted incentive program throughout 2020 helped drive the 19 average producing agent count growth as noted below 



net health sales increased 8 compared with the prior year while it was initially a challenge at this division to add virtual sales to their inperson sales model during the lockdown we are encouraged by the ability of this division to adapt and to adopt supplementary ways of doing business in this challenging environment demonstrated by the strong recovery in sales during the second half of the year 

the liberty national division represented 16 of all globe life health premium income at 189 million in 2020 liberty national markets limitedbenefit supplemental health products consisting primarily of critical illness insurance much of liberty national’s health business is generated through worksite marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 100 employees in 2020 health premium income declined slightly liberty nationals firstyear collected premium increased 2 to 202 million in 2020 compared with 197 million in 2019 health net sales for 2020 decreased by 2 million or 7 from 2019 primarily due our inability to prospect to businesses deemed nonessential that were closed during the early stages of the pandemic 

other distribution while some of the companys other distribution channels market health products their main emphasis is on life insurance on a combined basis they accounted for 16 of health premium in 2020 and 2019 the american income life division primarily markets accident plans the direct to consumer division markets primarily medicare supplements to employer or unionsponsored groups adding 4 million of medicare supplement net sales in 2020 and 2019 

annuities 

our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2020 and 2019 were 106 billion and 110 billion respectively underwriting margin was 90 million for 2020 and 95 million for 2019 

we do not currently market standalone fixed or deferred annuity products favoring instead protectionoriented life and supplemental health insurance products therefore we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward

investments 

we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14—business segments it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest on net insurance policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” 

management also views excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used 82 billion of excess cash flow at the parent company to repurchase globe life inc common shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater risk adjusted aftertax return than other investment alternatives if we had not used this excess cash to repurchase shares but had instead invested it in interestbearing assets we would have earned more investment income and had more shares outstanding as excess investment income per diluted common share incorporates all capital resources we view excess investment income per diluted share as a useful measure to evaluate the investment segment

excess investment income declined 13 million or 5 during 2020 excess investment income per diluted common share declined 1 during 2020 excess investment income per diluted common share generally increases at a faster pace than excess investment income because the number of diluted shares outstanding generally decreases from year to year as a result of our share repurchase program however in 2020 excess investment income declined primarily due to the low interest rate environment

net investment income increased at a compound annual growth rate of 3 over the 3 years ending 2020 while mean invested assets increased at a compound rate of 5 during the same period the tax equivalent effective annual yield rate earned on the fixed maturity portfolio was 534 in 2020 growth in net investment income has been negatively impacted in recent years by the low interest rate environment during which time we have invested new money at yields lower than our average portfolio yield in addition we have reinvested the proceeds from bonds that matured were called or were otherwise disposed of at yield rates less than what we earned on these bonds before their maturity or disposition we currently expect that the average annual turnover rate of fixed maturity assets will be less than 2 over the next five years the following chart presents the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets 



should the current low interest rate environment continue the growth of the companys net investment income will be negatively impacted primarily due to the investment of new money and proceeds from dispositions at rates less than the average portfolio yield rate while net investment income would grow it would continue to grow at rates less than the growth in mean invested assets for 2021 we currently anticipate the average new money yield on our fixed maturity acquisitions to be approximately 20 basis points lower than the rate applicable to our 2020 acquisitions 

should interest rates especially longterm rates rise globe lifes net investment income would benefit due to higher interest rates on new purchases while such a rise in interest rates could adversely affect the fair value of the fixed maturities portfolio we could withstand an increase in interest rates of approximately 160 to 165 basis points before the net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio as of december 31 2020 would be eliminated should interest rates increase further than that we would not be concerned with potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio because we have the intent and the ability to hold our investments to maturity 

required interest on net insurance policy liabilities reduces net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to “fund” required interest on net insurance policy liabilities which is the net of the benefit reserve liability and the deferred acquisition cost asset as such it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments as discussed in note 14—business segments management regards this as a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force 

the great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest rate protection policies not investment products and are accounted for under current gaap accounting guidance for longduration insurance products which mandate that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business each calendar year we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year and cannot be changed the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in as such the overall discount rate for the entire in force block of 57 is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years changes in the overall weightedaverage discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weightedaverage discount rate due to the size of our in force business 

since actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs due to the strength of our underwriting margins we do not expect an extended low interest rate environment will cause a loss recognition event

realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future since benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

despite our intent to hold fixed maturity investments for a long period of time investments are occasionally sold called or experience a credit loss event resulting in a realized gain or loss these sales are often in response to

deterioration in credit quality of the issuer in effort to maximize risk adjusted capital adjusted returns we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders in a bond exchange offer bondholders may consent to exchange their existing bonds for another class of debt securities the exchanges on our bonds have generally been the result of mergers and acquisitions and are offered to move debt to the new or surviving entity the company also has alternative investments held under the fair value option with changes recognized in realized gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations  

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause periodtoperiod trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

investment acquisitions  globe lifes investment policy calls for investing primarily in investment grade fixed maturities that meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities we believe this strategy is appropriate since our expected future cash flows are generally stable and predictable and the likelihood that we will need to sell invested assets to raise cash is low if longerterm securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available we do not compromise on our quality objectives instead we consider investing in shorterterm or loweryielding securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors such as risk adjusted capital adjusted returns 

during calendar years 2018 through 2020 globe life invested predominately in fixed maturity securities primarily in corporate and municipal bonds with longerterm maturities the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity investments the effective annual yield shown is based on the acquisition price and call features if any of the securities for noncallable bonds the yield is calculated to maturity date for callable bonds acquired at a premium the yield is calculated to the earliest known call date and call price after acquisition first call date for all other callable bonds the yield is calculated to maturity date

new cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations cash received on existing investments and proceeds from dispositions while dispositions increase funds available for investment as noted earlier in this discussion they can also have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the dispositions are reinvested at lower yields than the bonds that were disposed dispositions were 469 million in 2020 and 919 million in 2019

subsidiary capital  the national association of insurance commissioners naic has established a riskbased factor approach for determining threshold riskbased capital levels for all insurance companies this approach was designed to assist the regulatory bodies in identifying companies that may require regulatory attention a riskbased capital rbc ratio is typically determined by dividing adjusted total statutory capital by the amount of riskbased capital determined using the naic’s factors if a company’s rbc ratio approaches two times the rbc amount the company must file a plan with the naic for improving their capital levels this level is commonly referred to as “company action level” rbc companies typically hold a multiple of the company action level rbc depending on their particular business needs and risk profile 

our goal is to maintain statutory capital within our insurance subsidiaries at levels necessary to support our current ratings for 2020 globe life targeted a consolidated company action level rbc ratio of 300 to 320 the company concludes that this capital level is more than adequate and sufficient to support its current ratings given the nature of its business and its risk profile as of december 31 2020 our consolidated company action level rbc ratio was 309

shareholders equity  as noted under the caption analysis of share purchases within this report we have an ongoing share repurchase program 

  

globe life has continually increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years

we plan to use excess cash available at the parent company as efficiently as possible in the future possible uses of excess cash flow include but are not limited to share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in securities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that targeted capital levels are maintained in our insurance subsidiaries if market conditions are favorable we currently expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds 

we maintain a significant availableforsale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policy liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in market rates and liquidity in financial markets while a majority of invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity 

due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity an inconsistency exists in measurement which may have a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets due to the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by market rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits due to the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies 

  

approximately 90 of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2020 were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies under the caption future policy benefits otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the consolidated financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs such as advertising related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note 1—significant accounting policies under the caption deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements additionally the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies known as the value of insurance acquired voba is included in deferred acquisition costs our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1—significant accounting policies 

  

over 99 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2020 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2020 

  

less than 1 of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made the company concludes that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience

valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to manage risk we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio and the long average life small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report the company regards these unrealized fluctuations in value as having no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

at times the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening and accordingly to unrealized losses on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in note 1—significant accounting policies and in note 4—investments under the captions fair value measurements in both notes 

investments allowance for credit losses we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value to determine if a credit loss event has occurred when a credit event does occur an allowance for credit loss is recorded and the corresponding provision is recognized in the consolidated income statement in realized gains or losses noncredit related fluctuations in the fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for allowance for credit losses are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an allowance for credit loss it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security

defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plan covering a limited number of officers our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2020 our gross liability under these plans was 763 million but was offset by assets of 530 million 

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligationsexpenses for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled additionally a corridor approach is used to amortize any unrecognized gains or losses outside the corridor the standard 10 of the greater of plan pbo and fair value assets and have an amortization service period of approximately 9 years these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans for example a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2020 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2020

annuity products include singlepremium and flexiblepremium deferred annuities annuities in each of the three years ended december 31 2019 comprised less than 1 of premium the company does not currently market annuity products 

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency investment income expenses and target profit margins these assumptions are based on company experience and projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products profitability is affected by actual experience deviations from the pricing assumptions and to the extent investment income varies from that required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income in excess of the amounts required for policy reserves 

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each globe life insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information obtained from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants including but not limited to inspection reports pharmacy data doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in globe lifes consolidated financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health insurance policies written by globe lifes insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis the assumptions used in the calculation of globe lifes reserves are reported in note 1—significant accounting policies  reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

reinsurance 

globe life has historically participated in very limited thirdparty reinsurance contracts as a result of the low face amounts of the policies sold by the company see schedule iv and note 6—commitments and contingencies for more information 

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of globe life insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities approximately 95 of our invested assets at fair value are fixed maturities at december 31 2019 see note 4—investments and management’s discussion and analysis

competition 

  

globe life competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with globe life no individual company dominates any of globe lifes life or health insurance markets 

  

globe lifes health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes our companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows globe life to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

regulation 

insurance —insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted insurance companies are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

riskbased capital rbc —the naic requires that a riskbased capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the riskbased capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all globe lifes insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the riskbased capital formula see further discussion of rbc in capital res ources  

guaranty assessments —state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is based on its proportional share of the premium in each state a significant portion of assessments are recoverable as offsets against state premium taxes 

holding company —states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system globe life and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in indiana nebraska ohio and new york 

insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

the insurance industry is a regulated industry populated by many public and private companies we operate in the industrys life and health insurance sectors each of which has its own set of risks 

operational risks 

the development and maintenance of our various distribution channels are critical to growth in product sales and profits development and retention of producing agents are critical to support sales growth in this market because our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals and the face amounts of the life insurance policies sold are typically lower than those of policies sold in higherincome markets if we do not provide compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that motivates producing agents to increase sales of our products our growth could be impeded in addition a failure to effectively develop new methods of reaching consumers and realizing cost efficiencies in our direct to consumer division business could result in reduced sales and profits 

  

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations we primarily serve the lower middleincome to middleincome market for individual life and supplemental health insurance and as a result we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of a significant sustained economic downturn or otherwise then new sales of our insurance products may become more challenging and our policyholders could choose to defer or stop payment of insurance premiums altogether economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under investment risks below 

  

variations in expectedtoactual rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test actualtoexpected results actual results may differ significantly from the levels assumed and could result in increased policy obligations and negatively affect our profit margins and income 

  

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us by limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and reducing our sales by adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through independent insurance agencies 

  

rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of capital actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could potentially have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations such an event could limit our access to capital markets increase the cost of debt or impair our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations thereby potentially limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

ratings reflect only a rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control in addition rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered the models changes to the models could impact a rating agencys judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company there can be no 

gl 2019 form 10k 

assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

life insurance marketplace risk 

our life insurance products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish we have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches two of which are labor unions and sales via direct to consumer solicitations deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to direct to consumer marketing initiatives could negatively affect our life insurance business 

  

supplemental health insurance marketplace risks 

the supplemental health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny regulatory changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health business the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our supplemental health insurance business 

  

competition in the health insurance market can be significant sales of our supplemental health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors in addition some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or underprice new sales in order to gain market share we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms accordingly changes in the competitive landscape including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products 

  

obtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain supplemental health insurance policies is critical a significant percentage of the supplemental health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance including conditions under which the premiums for such policies may be increased is highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result our medicare supplement business is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success since medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are typically necessary obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of appropriate premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus our business financial condition and results of operations 

information security and technology risks 

  

the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the company could compromise data security thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations our business is highly dependent upon the internet thirdparty service providers and information systems to operate in an efficient and resilient manner we gather and maintain data for the purpose of conducting marketing actuarial analysis sales and policy administration functions 

our information systems may be vulnerable to disruption from physical or electronic attacks by malicious thirdparties which could render our systems inaccessible for business use for a period of time additionally we may not become aware of sophisticated cyberattacks for some time after they occur thereby potentially increasing the data subject to loss these risks are heightened as the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks increase 

malicious thirdparties employee or agent errors or disasters affecting our information systems could impair our business operations regulatory compliance and financial condition employee or agent errors in the handling of our information systems may inadvertently result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information or an inability to use our information systems to efficiently support business operations disasters terrorist attacks or war could cause our information or system availability to be inaccessible for business use for a period of time

more frequent and sophisticated cyberattacks and more impactful regulatory oversight models could result in additional costs to protect against security breaches any breach of confidential information systems resulting from the above factors could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter potential customers from purchasing our products result in the loss of existing customers subject us to significant civil and criminal liability constrain cash flows or require us to incur significant technical legal or other expenses 

reputational risk 

  

damage to the reputation of globe life or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business negative publicity through traditional media internet social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts the ability to market our products and the persistency of inforce policies as discussed in information security and technology risks  the company could be subjected to adverse publicity as a result of a significant security breach 

investment risks 

  

our investments are subject to market and credit risks significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values our investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed maturity and shortterm investments where we are exposed to the risk that individual issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments a concentration of these investments in any particular issuer industry group of related industries or geographic areas could increase this risk factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels consisting of both treasury rate and credit spread financial market performance disruptions in credit markets general economic conditions legislative changes particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control 

additionally as the majority of our investments are longterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity a significant increase in interest rates or a market downturn could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses could substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses could experience a default event and a portion or all of that unrealized loss could be unrecoverable in that case the unrealized loss would be realized at which point we would take an impairment charge reducing our net income 

  

we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all significant downgrades or defaults of issuers could negatively impact our riskbased capital ratios leading to potential downgrades of the company by rating agencies potential reduction in future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries andor higher financing costs at the parent company should additional statutory capital be required 

  

changes in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate net policy liabilities which could have a negative impact on income significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers any such calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower interest rates 

a rise in interest rates could result in certain policyholders surrendering their life health or annuity policies for cash thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate invested assets if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations in such a case realized losses could result from the sale of the invested assets and could adversely affect our statutory income consolidated rbc ratio and results of operations 

gl 2019 form 10k 

liquidity risks 

  

our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on available funds from our insurance subsidiaries as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity include a variety of shortterm and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper longterm debt intercompany financing and reinsurance 

the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on regulations by their states of domicile accordingly impairments in assets or disruptions in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduce their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow the payment of dividends a principal source of our cash flow to us 

  

changes in laws or regulations in the states in which our companies are domiciled could constrain the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to pay our debt obligations corporate expenses or dividends on our capital stock additionally if our insurance subsidiaries were unable to obtain approval of supplemental health insurance premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities their profitability and their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us could be negatively impacted 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital should interest rates rise in the future the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced in addition if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions could limit our ability to replace maturing debt obligations in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability and cost of additional financing or capital depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we would prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility if so our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected 

regulatory risks 

  

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of policyholders not investors regulatory agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions included in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising agent licensing policy forms capital adequacy solvency 

gl 2019 form 10k 

reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting our companies may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business should regulatory changes occur we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of such laws and regulations if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend some or all of our business activities andor impose substantial fines 

  

we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives in recent years there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries by insurance regulatory authorities which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our agents are improper such actions could result in substantial fines penalties andor prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to our practices that may in some cases limit our ability to grow impact regulatory capital requirements or otherwise negatively impact our profitability 

  

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs or negatively impact our insurance subsidiaries capital changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry including the products insurers offer could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries capital or limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to sell certain of their products 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may affect our financial statements reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap and accounting practices as promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners’ statutory accounting practices naic sap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations refer to note 1 — significant accounting policies under the caption a ccounting pronouncements yet to be adopted  further standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time many of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability 

noncompliance with laws or regulations related to customer and consumer privacy and information security including a failure to ensure that our business associates with access to sensitive customer and consumer information maintain its confidentiality could materially adversely affect our reputation and business operations the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of personally identifiable information by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

gl 2019 form 10k 

litigation risks 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries we are and in the future may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants and in certain of these matters the plaintiffs are seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis however the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty a number of civil jury verdicts involving insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries do business these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states in which we operate juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for an unpredictable material adverse judgment in any given punitive damages suit 

  

our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases the costs of settlement or judgments against us or changes in our operations that could result from such litigation substantial legal liability in these pending or future legal actions could also have a material adverse financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation which in turn could materially harm our business and our business prospects 

actual or alleged misclassification of independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries could result in adverse legal tax or financial consequences a significant portion of our sales agents are independent contractors although we believe we have properly classified such individuals a risk nevertheless exists that a court the internal revenue service or other authority will take the position that those sales agents are employees the laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of workers are subject to change and differing interpretations which we cannot predict 

if there is an adverse determination regarding the classification of some or all of the independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries by a court or governmental agency we could incur significant costs with respect to payroll tax liabilities employee benefits wage payments fines judgments andor legal settlements any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any resulting reclassification could necessitate significant changes in our affected insurance subsidiaries’ business models 

catastrophic event risk 

  

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a pandemic hurricane earthquake or manmade catastrophes including acts of terrorism or war which may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition

1 net operating income is the consolidated total of segment profits after tax and as such is considered a nongaap measure it has been used consistently by globe lifes management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the company it differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain nonoperating items such as realized gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure 

net operating income as an roe excluding net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio is considered a nongaap measure management utilizes this measure to view the business without the effect of the net unrealized gains which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates on the availableforsale portfolio the impact of the adjustment to exclude net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 20 billion and 426 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively 

book value per share excluding net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio is also considered a nongaap measure management utilizes this measure to view the book value of the business without the effect of net unrealized gains which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates on the available for sale portfolio the impact of the adjustment to exclude net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 1776 and 379 for 2019 and 2018 respectively

managements discussion  analysis 

a discussion of each of globe lifes segments follows the following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations as described in note 14—business segments  

  

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” 

• annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue 

• net sales is annualized premium issued gross premium that would be received during the policies first year in force and assuming that none of the policies lapsed or terminated net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of our direct to consumer division where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a better indicator of the rate of premium growth as compared with annualized premium issued 

• firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

life insurance 

life insurance is the companys predominant segment with 2019 life premium representing 70 of total premium and life underwriting margin representing 74 of the total additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment

the american income life division markets to members of labor unions and continues to diversify its lead sources by building relationships with other affinity groups utilizing thirdparty internet vendor leads and obtaining referrals to ensure sustainable growth this division is globe lifes largest contributor to life premium of any distribution channel at 46 of the companys 2019 total net sales increased to 238 million in 2019 over the 2018 total of 224 million sales growth in our exclusive agencies is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force 

american income continues to focus on growing and strengthening the agency force specifically through additional agency office openings and focus on middlemanagement growth in addition to offering financial incentives and training opportunities the agency has made considerable investments in information technology including launching a lead mapping and customer relationship management tool for the agency force we anticipate this tool will help enhance agent productivity and agent retention 

the direct to consumer division offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of marketing approaches including direct mailings insert media and electronic media in recent years electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology and has focused on driving traffic to our inbound call center the different approaches support and complement one another in the divisions efforts to reach the consumer the direct to consumer divisions longterm growth has been fueled by constant innovation and name recognition we continually introduce new initiatives in this division in an attempt to increase response rates 

while the juvenile market is an important source of sales it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders who are more likely to respond favorably to a direct to consumer solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time the underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 18 for the two years ended 2019 

the liberty national division markets individual life insurance to middleincome household and worksite customers recent investments in new sales technologies as well as recent growth in middle management within the agency will help continue this growth the underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 26 up from 24 for the year ended 2018 the increase is primarily attributable to higher than normal policy obligations during 2018 compared with lower policy obligations during the same period in 2019 

the liberty national division average producing agent count increased 9 in 2019 we continue to execute our long term plan to grow this agency through expansion from smalltown markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers continued expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated lesspenetrated areas will help create longterm agency growth additionally the agency continues to help improve the ability of agents to develop new worksite marketing business systems that have been put in place including the addition of a customer relationship management crm platform and enhanced analytical capabilities have helped the agents develop additional worksite marketing opportunities as well improve the productivity of agents selling in the individual market

a discussion of health operations by distribution channel follows

this division is also globe lifes largest producer of medicare supplement insurance the united american division represents 78 of all medicare supplement premium and 95 of medicare supplement net sales medicare supplement premium in this agency rose 10 to 406 million in 2019 over the prior period balance of 370 million underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 14 down from 16 for the prior year this decrease was primarily due to higher policy obligations and amortization of deferred acquisition costs as a percentage of premium in 2019 compared with 2018

we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14—business segments it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest on net insurance policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” 

management also views excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used 78 billion of excess cash flow at the parent company to repurchase globe life inc common shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater risk adjusted aftertax return than other investment alternatives if we had not used this excess cash to repurchase shares but had instead invested it in interestbearing assets we would have earned more investment income and had more shares outstanding as excess investment income per diluted common share incorporates all capital resources we view excess investment income per diluted share as a useful measure to evaluate the investment segment

net investment income increased at a compound annual growth rate of 4 during the last three years growth in net investment income has been negatively impacted in recent years by the low interest rate environment during which time we have invested new money at yields lower than our average portfolio yield in addition we have reinvested the proceeds from bonds that matured or were called or otherwise disposed of at yield rates less than what we earned on these bonds before their maturity or disposition we currently expect that the turnover rate of fixed maturity assets will be less than 3 in 2020 and the average annual turnover rate during the next five years will not exceed 1 to 15 of the portfolio the following chart presents the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets 



should interest rates especially longterm rates rise globe lifes net investment income would benefit due to higher interest rates on new purchases while such a rise in interest rates could adversely affect the fair value of the fixed maturities portfolio we could withstand an increase in interest rates of approximately 115 to 120 basis points before the net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio as of december 31 2019 would be eliminated should interest rates increase further than that we would not be concerned with potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio because we have the intent and the ability to hold our investments to maturity 

required interest on net insurance policy liabilities reduces net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to “fund” required interest on net insurance policy liabilities which is the net of the benefit reserve liability and the deferred acquisition cost asset as such it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments as discussed in note 14—business segments management regards this as a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force 

the great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest rate protection policies not investment products and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for longduration insurance products which mandate that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business each calendar year we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year and cannot be changed the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in as such the overall discount rate for the entire in force block of 56 is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years changes in the overall weightedaverage discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weightedaverage discount rate due to the size of our in force business 

since actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs due to the strength of our underwriting margins we do not expect an extended low interest rate environment to cause a loss recognition event

realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future since benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

despite our intent to hold fixed maturity investments for a long period of time investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses generally occur only incidentally usually as the

managements discussion  analysis 

result of bonds sold because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by write downs due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders in a bond exchange offer bondholders may consent to exchange their existing bonds for another class of debt securities the exchanges on our bonds have generally been the result of mergers and acquisitions and are offered to move debt to the new or surviving entity 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause periodtoperiod trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

investment acquisitions  globe lifes investment policy calls for investing primarily in investment grade fixed maturities that meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities we believe this strategy is appropriate since our expected future cash flows are generally stable and predictable and the likelihood that we will need to sell invested assets to raise cash is low if longerterm securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available we do not compromise on our quality objectives instead we consider investing in shorterterm or loweryielding securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors such as risk adjusted capital adjusted returns 

during calendar years 2017 through 2019 globe life invested predominately in fixed maturity securities primarily in corporate and municipal bonds with longerterm maturities the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases for the last three years premiums and discounts are amortized using the interest method when amortized cost of a callable debt security exceeds the first call price the premium is amortized to the earliest call date otherwise the period of amortization or accretion generally extends from the purchase date to the maturity date

the overall quality rating of the portfolio has increased to a from bbb since the prior year the first time the overall rating of the portfolio has been a since 2016 the increase was aided by reduced exposure to below investment grade securities as well as acquisitions of fixed maturities rated a and above primarily in the municipal sector 

fixed maturities rated bbb are 55 of the total portfolio as compared to 58 at the end of 2018 while this ratio is high relative to our peers we have limited exposure to higherrisk assets such as derivatives equities commercial mortgages and assetbacked securities additionally the company does not participate in securities lending has no offbalance sheet investments and has no exposure to european sovereign debt as of december 31 2019 bbb securities provide the company with the best risk adjusted capital adjusted returns largely due to our unique ability to hold securities to maturity regardless of fluctuations in interest rates or equity markets

financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides globe life with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required to support our business operations and meet our financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

insurance subsidiary liquidity  the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs cash inflows for the insurance subsidiaries primarily include premium and investment income in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are cash inflows cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes the funds to provide for policy benefits the majority of which are paid in future periods are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities as they better match the longterm nature of these obligations excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restrictions the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains while the leading source of the excess cash is investment income a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control 

  

parent company liquidity cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt operating expenses of the parent company and parent company dividends to globe life shareholders 



for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 12—shareholders equity although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company 

shortterm borrowings an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 750 million which could be extended up to 1 billion while globe life can request the extension it is not guaranteed the facility is further designated as a backup line of credit for a commercial paper program as well as the standby letters of credit as discussed below as of december 31 2019 we had available 310 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility compared with 293 million a year earlier there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended december 31 2019 the facility will mature in may 2021 

  

the parent company expects to have readily available funds for 2020 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of debt an additional shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing 

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from continuing operations were 135 billion in 2019 compared with 128 billion in 2018 in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies received proceeds from maturities calls and repayments of fixed maturities in the amount of 840 million in 2019 compared with 344 million in 2018 

our cash and shortterm investments were 114 million at the end of 2019 compared with 184 million at the end of 2018 in addition to these liquid assets the entire 189 billion fair value at december 31 2019 portfolio of fixed income securities is available for sale in the event of an unexpected need approximately 97 of our fixed income securities are publicly traded freely tradable under sec rule 144 or qualified for resale under sec rule 144a we

generally expect to hold fixed income securities to maturity and even though these securities are classified as available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold any securities which are temporarily impaired until they mature our strong cash flows from operations ongoing investment maturities and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity highly unlikely 

offbalance sheet arrangements as a part of its aforementioned credit facility globe life had outstanding 150 million in standby letters of credit at december 31 2019 on april 2 2019 the letters of credit were amended to reduce the amount outstanding from 155 million as of december 31 2018 these letters are issued among our subsidiaries one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer and have no impact on company obligations as a whole any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of offshore captive reinsurers might require globe life to obtain thirdparty financing which could cause an insignificant increase in financing costs

4 pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans they are offset by invested assets in the trusts which are funded through periodic contributions by globe life in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the obligations as they become due therefore our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on globe lifes consolidated balance sheets  at december 31 2019 these pension obligations were 665 million offset by assets of 469 million in the pension assets the schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted please refer to note 9—postretirement benefits for more information on pension obligations 

5 future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force at december 31 2019 these estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality morbidity and persistency the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown the company concludes that the assets supporting the liability of 15 billion at december 31 2019 along with future premiums and investment income will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations

subsidiary capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic has established a riskbased factor approach for determining threshold riskbased capital levels for all insurance companies this approach was designed to assist the regulatory bodies in identifying companies that may require regulatory attention a riskbased capital rbc ratio is typically determined by dividing adjusted total statutory capital by the amount of riskbased capital determined using the naic’s factors if a company’s rbc ratio approaches two times the rbc amount the company must file a plan with the naic for improving their capital levels this level is commonly referred to as “company action level” rbc companies typically hold a multiple of the company action level rbc depending on their particular business needs and risk profile 

our goal is to maintain statutory capital within our insurance subsidiaries at levels necessary to support our current ratings for 2019 globe life targeted a consolidated company action level rbc ratio of 300 to 320 the company concludes that this capital level is more than adequate and sufficient to support its current ratings given the nature of its business and its risk profile as of december 31 2019 our consolidated company action level rbc ratio was 318

due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets from time to time the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity due to the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios

future policy benefits due to the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies 

  

approximately 89 of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2019 were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies under the caption future policy benefits otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the consolidated financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs such as advertising related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note 1—significant accounting policies under the caption deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements additionally the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies known as the value of insurance acquired voba is included in deferred acquisition costs our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1—significant accounting policies

managements discussion  analysis 

over 99 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2019 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2019 

  

less than 1 of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made the company concludes that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to manage risk we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio and the long average life small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report the company regards these unrealized fluctuations in value as having no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

at times the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening and accordingly to unrealized losses on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in note 1—significant accounting policies and in note 4—investments under the captions fair value measurements in both notes 

impairment of investments we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value and that have become impaired in value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an otherthantemporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security

defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plan covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2019 our gross liability under these plans was 665 million but was offset by assets of 469 million 

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans for example a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2019 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2019

the company determines mortality assumptions through the use of published mortality tables that reflect broadbased studies of mortality and published longevity improvement scales

annuity products include singlepremium and flexiblepremium deferred annuities annuities in each of the three years ended december 31 2018  comprised less than 1 of premium 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency investment income expenses and target profit margins these assumptions are based on company experience and projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products profitability is affected by actual experience deviations from the pricing assumptions and to the extent investment income varies from that required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income in excess of the amounts required for policy reserves

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information obtained from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants including but not limited to inspection reports pharmacy data doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s consolidated financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in note 1—significant accounting policies   reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

  

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities approximately 95  of our invested assets at fair value are fixed maturities at december 31 2018   see   note 4—investments  and management’s discussion and analysis   

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance    insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

riskbased capital rbc   the naic requires that a riskbased capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the riskbased capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the riskbased capital formula

guaranty assessments    state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is based on its proportional share of the premium in each state a significant portion of assessments are recoverable as offsets against state premium taxes see note 6—commitments and contingencies   for current assessment

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

the insurance industry is a regulated industry populated by many public and private companies we operate in the industrys life and health insurance sectors each of which has its own set of risks 

  

operational risks 

the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits development and retention of producing agents are critical to support sales growth in this market because our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals and the face amounts of the life insurance policies sold are typically lower than those of policies sold in higherincome markets compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and motivates producing agents to increase sales is also critical globe life direct response is continuously developing new methods of reaching consumers and realizing cost efficiencies less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits 

  

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  we primarily serve the lowermiddle to middleincome market for individual life and health insurance and as a result we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of a significant sustained economic downturn or otherwise then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging and our policyholders may choose to defer or stop payment of insurance premiums altogether economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under investment risks  below 

  

variations in expectedtoactual rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test expectedtoactual results actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set accordingly we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of policyholder benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments significant adverse variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could result in increased policy obligations and negatively affect our profit margins and income 

  

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to fulfill its contractual obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways including limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through independent insurance agencies 

  

rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of capital actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could potentially have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations such an event could limit our access to capital markets increase the cost of debt or impair our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations thereby potentially limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

ratings reflect only a rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated 

tmk 2018 form 10k 

company’s control in addition rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered the models changes to the models could impact a rating agencys judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

our life insurance products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish  we have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches two of which are labor unions and sales via globe life direct response solicitation deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to direct response marketing initiatives could negatively affect our life insurance business 

  

health insurance marketplace risks 

the health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny  regulatory changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health business the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our health insurance business 

  

competition in the health insurance market can be significant  sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors in addition some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or underprice new sales in order to gain market share we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms accordingly changes in the competitive landscape including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products 

  

obtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain health insurance policies is critical  a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance including conditions under which the premiums for such policies may be increased is highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result our medicare supplement business is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success since medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are typically necessary obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus our business financial condition and results of operations 

information security and technology risks 

  

the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the company could compromise data security thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations our business is highly dependent upon information systems to operate in an efficient and resilient manner we gather and maintain data on our information systems including the identity health and financial information of our current former and prospective policyholders for the purpose of conducting marketing sales and policy administration functions this information is highly targeted by malicious threat actors 

malicious threat actors employee or agent errors or disasters affecting our information systems could impair our business operations regulatory compliance and financial condition an attacker could circumvent security measures in order to access alter or delete data from our systems or to render our systems unavailable for business use additionally we may not become aware of sophisticated cyberattacks for some time after they occur thereby increasing the companys exposure we may have to incur significant costs to address existing and future regulatory requirements related thereto these risks are heightened as the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks increase 

tmk 2018 form 10k 

employee or agent errors in the handling of our information systems may inadvertently result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information or an inability to use our information systems to efficiently support business operations 

we may utilize the services of third parties in order to conduct our business cyber events affecting these third parties could materially impact our sales and operational efficiency 

we anticipate more frequent and sophisticated cyberattacks along with more impactful regulatory oversight models an increasing number of states also require that customers be notified of unauthorized access use or disclosure of their confidential information any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter potential customers from purchasing our products result in the loss of existing customers subject us to significant civil and criminal liability or require us to incur significant technical legal or other expenses 

in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an industrial accident a blackout or a terrorist attack or war our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees agents or customers for a period of time  a disaster or natural catastrophe an industrial accident terrorist attack or war may make our information systems unavailable to support business operations for a period of time which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations even if our employees are able to report to work they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and existing contingency plans cannot function as designed 

reputational risk 

  

damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business  negative publicity through traditional media internet social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts the ability to market our products and the persistency of our block of inforce policies as discussed above in information security and technology risks  the company could be subjected to adverse publicity as a result of a significant security breach 

investment risks 

  

our investments are subject to market and credit risks significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values our investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed maturity and shortterm investments where we are exposed to the risk that individual issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments the concentration of these investments in any particular issuer industry group of related industries or geographic areas increases this risk factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels consisting of both treasury rate and credit spread financial market performance disruptions in credit markets general economic conditions legislative changes particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control 

additionally as the majority of our investments are longerterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity significant increases in interest rates or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses could substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses could experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss could be unrecoverable in that case the unrealized loss would be realized at which point we would take an impairment charge reducing our net income 

  

we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all significant downgrades or defaults of issuers could negatively impact our riskbased capital ratios leading to potential downgrades of the company by rating agencies potential reduction in future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries andor higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required 

  

tmk 2018 form 10k 

changes in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate net policy liabilities we attempt to manage our investments to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting the discount rates used to calculate net policy liabilities there is a risk that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will prevent us from doing so thereby having a negative impact on income significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers any such calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

increases in interest rates could cause the fair value of securities within our fixed maturity portfolio to decline a rise in interest rates could also result in certain policyholders surrendering their annuity policies for cash thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate invested assets if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations in such a case realized losses could result from such sales and could adversely affect our statutory income consolidated rbc ratio and results of operations 

liquidity risks 

  

our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available primarily dividends from our insurance subsidiaries as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity include a variety of shortterm and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper longterm debt intercompany financing and reinsurance 

the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on regulations by their states of domicile  accordingly impairments in assets or disruptions in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduce their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow the payment of dividends to us a principal source of our cash flow 

  

changes in laws or regulations in the states in which our companies are domiciled could constrain the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses additionally if our insurance subsidiaries were unable to obtain approval of our health insurance premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities their profitability and their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us could be negatively impacted limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital should interest rates rise in the future the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced in addition if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability and cost of additional financing or capital depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of 

tmk 2018 form 10k 

our business activity were to decrease due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we would prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility if so our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected 

regulatory risks 

  

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of policyholders not investors state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising agent licensing policy forms capital adequacy solvency reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting the company may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business should regulatory changes occur we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of such laws and regulations which may change from time to time if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend some or all of our business activities andor impose substantial fines 

  

we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives in recent years there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries by insurance regulatory authorities which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our agents are improper such actions could result in substantial fines penalties andor prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to our practices that may in some cases limit our ability to grow impact regulatory capital requirements or otherwise negatively impact our profitability 

  

currently the us federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance however the doddfrank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 established a federal insurance office fio charged with monitoring systemic risk exposure in all lines of insurance other than health insurance and longterm care insurance and a financial stability oversight council fsoc which serves to identify and respond to risks and emerging threats to us financial systems a center for consumer information and insurance oversight cciio established under the department of health and human services is charged with overseeing implementation of the affordable care act aca the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct oversight or regulation of the insurance industry we cannot predict what impact if any the ongoing operations of the fio fsoc and cciio as well as any other proposals or executive action for federal oversight or regulation of insurance could have on our business results of operations or financial condition 

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs or negatively impact our insurance subsidiaries capital changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry including the products insurers offer could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries capital or limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to sell certain of their products 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may affect our financial statements reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap and accounting practices as promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners’ statutory accounting practices naic sap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by 

tmk 2018 form 10k 

recognized authoritative bodies future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time many of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability 

noncompliance with laws or regulations related to customer and consumer privacy and information security including a failure to ensure that our business associates with access to sensitive customer and consumer information maintain its confidentiality could materially adversely affect our reputation and business operations the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of personally identifiable information by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries we are and in the future may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants and in certain of these matters the plaintiffs are seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis however the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty a number of civil jury verdicts involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries do business these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states in which we operate juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit 

  

our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases the costs of settlement or judgments against us or changes in our operations that could result from litigation substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material adverse financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation which in turn could materially harm our business and our business prospects 

actual or alleged misclassification of independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries could result in adverse legal tax or financial consequences a significant portion of our sales agents are independent contractors although we believe we have properly classified such individuals a risk nevertheless exists that a court the irs or other authority will take the position that those sales agents are employees the laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of workers are subject to change and differing interpretations which we cannot predict 

if there is an adverse determination regarding the classification of some or all of the independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries by a court or governmental agency we could incur significant costs with respect to payroll tax liabilities employee benefits wage payments fines judgments andor legal settlements any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any resulting reclassification could necessitate significant changes in our affected insurance subsidiaries’ business models 

catastrophic event risk 

  

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a 

tmk 2018 form 10k 

pandemic hurricane earthquake or manmade catastrophes including acts of terrorism or war which may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition

current year highlights 

 

the following represents net income and net operating income from continuing operations for the 3 years ended december 31 2018  

 in addition the company recorded an adjustment of 874 million to net income during 2017 in 2018 the company completed its analysis of the tax legislation and recorded an additional 798 thousand adjustment related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the 21 rate as the impact of the tax legislation was treated as a nonoperating event it was excluded from net operating income 

 net operating income as an roe excluding net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio is also considered a nongaap measure management utilizes this measure to view the business without the effect of the unrealized gains or losses which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates on the available for sale portfolio 

summary of operations 

net income was 701 million  in 2018  compared with 15 billion  in 2017  this decrease was primarily due to an 874 million increase to net income in 2017 relating to new tax legislation as described above net income increased  in 2017  from 550 million  in 2016  on a diluted per common share basis 2018  net income fell   50  to 609  after a 172   increase  in 2017  net income per diluted common share in 2017   rose  to 1222  from 449  in 2016  as previously noted 2017  net income per diluted common share includes the effect of the adjustment to net income relating to new tax legislation the percentage growth in net income per share results continues to exceed the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program each year’s net income per share was affected by realized gains losses which were 001  015  and 006  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively more information concerning realized gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses  in this report 

net operating income from continuing operations rose  each year over the prior year from 549 million  in 2016  to 574 million  in 2017  to 707 million  in 2018  net operating income is the consolidated total of segment profits after tax and 

tmk 2018 form 10k 

as such is considered a nongaap measure net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments additionally net income was affected by certain significant and unusual nonoperating items in each of the years 2016  through 2018  we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are nonoperating items when evaluating the results of current operations and therefore exclude such items from our segment analysis for current periods

share purchases 

torchmark has an ongoing share repurchase program that began in 1986 and is reviewed quarterly by management and annually reaffirmed by the board of directors the program was reaffirmed on august 7 2018 with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the excess cash flow at the parent company general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess cash flow excess cash flow at the parent company is primarily comprised of dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries less interest expense paid on its debt dividends paid to torchmark shareholders and other limited operating activities additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the resulting tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises the board of directors has authorized the company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management in consultation with the board determines to be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the last three years

the globe life direct response  unit offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of directtoconsumer marketing approaches which include direct mailings insert media and electronic media these different approaches support and complement one another in the unit’s efforts to reach the consumer the globe life direct response channel’s longterm growth has been fueled by constant innovation in recent years electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology and has focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center we continually introduce new initiatives in this unit in an attempt to increase response rates 

while the juvenile market is an important source of sales it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders who are more likely to respond favorably to a globe life direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 

globe life direct response’s life premium income rose   2  to 829 million  representing 34  of torchmark’s total life premium during 2018  life premium in this channel increased   4  in 2017  to 813 million  over the 2016  total of 783 million  net sales of 126 million  for this group decreased   7  from 136 million  in 2017  after a 10   decrease  in 2017  due to operational changes designed to maximize underwriting margin dollars in 2019  we expect sales to be relatively flat or increase slightly firstyear collected premium decreased   10  to 82 million  in 2018  after having decreased   7  in 2017  

the liberty national exclusive agency  markets individual and group life insurance to lower middle to middleincome customers life premium income for this agency was 279 million  in 2018  an increase of   2  from 275 million  in 2017  life premium income in 2016  totaled 270 million  net sales increased   5  during 2018  to 49 million  over the 2017  total of 47 million  net sales in 2017   increased   17  the continued increases in net sales reflect changes in structure of the agency that were put in place several years ago recent growth in middle management within the agency should help continue this growth firstyear collected premium increased   10  to 36 million  during 2018  and increased   14  in 2017  to 33 million  

the liberty average producing agent count increased from 2017  in 2017  to 2156  in 2018  we continue to execute our long term plan to grow this agency through expansion from smalltown markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated lesspenetrated areas will help create long term agency growth additionally the agencys prospecting training program has helped to improve the ability of agents to develop new work site marketing business 

the other agencies  distribution channels offering life insurance include the military agency the ua independent agency which predominantly writes health insurance and various smaller distribution channels the other agencies contributed 217 million  of life premium income or 9  of torchmark’s total in 2018  but contributed only 3  of net sales for the year

health insurance 

health insurance sold by torchmark includes primarily medicare supplement insurance critical illness coverage accident coverage and other limitedbenefit supplemental health products in this analysis all health coverage plans other than medicare supplement are classified as limitedbenefit plans 

health premium accounted for 30  of our total premium in 2018  while the health underwriting margin accounted for 26  of total underwriting margin reflective of the lower underwriting margin as a percent of premium for health compared with life insurance as noted under the caption life insurance  we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health due to life’s superior profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income

the ua independent agency  consists of independent agencies appointed with torchmark who may also sell for other companies the ua independent agency was torchmark’s largest health agency in terms of health premium income in 2018  premium income was 381 million  representing 38  of torchmark’s total health premium net sales were 70 million  or 41  of torchmark’s health sales this agency is also torchmark’s largest producer of medicare supplement insurance with medicare supplement premium income of 370 million  the ua independent agency represents 75  of all torchmark medicare supplement premium and 94  of medicare supplement net sales medicare supplement premium in this agency rose   5  in 2018  total health premium increased   5  in 2018  and 3  in 2017  medicare supplement net sales increased   15  in 2018  from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in individual sales 

the family heritage exclusive agency  primarily markets limitedbenefit supplemental health insurance in nonurban areas most of their policies include a cashback feature such as a return of premium where any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy management expects to grow this agency through geographic expansion and continuing incorporation of torchmark’s recruiting systems the family heritage agency contributed 60 million  in net sales in 2018  compared with 57 million  in 2017  and 51 million  in 2016  health premium income was 273 million  in 2018  representing 27  of torchmark’s health premium this compared with 254 million  or 26  of health premium in 2017  and 236 million  or 25  in 2016

underwriting margin as a percent of premium was 24  up from 22  for the year ended december 31 2017  the increase was primarily attributed to the runoff of older business and the growing portion of new business sold at higher margins the average producing agent count was 1064  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared with 995  for the same period in 2017  an increase of   7  

the liberty national exclusive agency  represented 19  of all torchmark health premium income at 191 million  in 2018  the liberty agency markets limitedbenefit supplemental health products consisting primarily of critical illness insurance much of liberty’s health business is now generated through work site marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees in 2018  health premium income declined   2  after declining   3  during 2017  liberty’s health premium decline is primarily attributable to its declining medicare supplement block libertys firstyear collected premium increased   8  to 18 million  in 2018  compared with an increase of   2  in 2017  reflecting the steady increase in net sales of limitedbenefit plans in the agency 

other distribution  certain of our other distribution channels market health products although their main emphasis is on life insurance on a combined basis they accounted for 16  of health premium in 2018  and 17  in 2017  the american income exclusive agency primarily markets accident plans the direct response group markets primarily medicare supplements to employer or unionsponsored groups direct response added 5 million  of medicare supplement net sales in 2018  and 6 million  in 2017  and 2016  

annuities 

  our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2018  and 2017  were 118 billion  and 125 billion  respectively underwriting income was 104 million  106 million  and 94 million  for the three years ended december 31 2018  respectively 

we do not currently market standalone fixed or deferred annuity products favoring instead protectionoriented life and health insurance products therefore we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward

administrative expenses 

operating expenses are included in the corporate and other segment and are classified into two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company insurance administrative expenses generally include those expenses incurred after a policy has been issued expenses associated with the issuance of our insurance policies are reflected as acquisition expenses and included in the determination of underwriting margin the following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2018  

  

operating expenses selected information

the 63   increase  in insurance administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in other employee costs and information technology salaries and expenses other employee costs increased primarily due to higher pension expense driven by lower interest rates t he increase in information technology costs reflects investments related to data analytics capabilities administrative systems modernizations and information security programs the increase  in stockbased compensation expense was primarily due to higher expense associated with equity awards reflecting torchmarks higher share price as compared with the same period a year ago

investments 

we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14—business segments   it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest on net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” 

we also view excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used 75 billion  of excess cash flow at the parent company to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater risk adjusted aftertax return than other investment alternatives if we had not used this excess cash to repurchase shares but had instead invested it in interestbearing assets we would have earned more investment income and had more shares outstanding as  excess investment income per diluted common share incorporates all capital resources we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is a useful measure to evaluate the investment segment in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

excess investment income    the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data   



 

excess investment income increased   6 million  or 2  during 2018  after increasing 7  during 2017  excess investment income per diluted common share increased   6  during 2018  after increasing   10  during 2017  excess investment income per diluted common share generally increases at a faster pace than excess investment income because the number of diluted shares outstanding generally decreases from year to year as a result of our share repurchase program 

net investment income  increased at a compound annual growth rate of 4  during the last three years growth in net investment income has been negatively impacted in recent years by the declining interest rate environment during which time we have invested new money and reinvested the proceeds from bonds that matured or were called or otherwise disposed of at yield rates less than what we earned on these bonds before their maturity or disposition we currently expect that the average annual turnover rate of fixed maturity assets during the next five years will not exceed 1 to 3 of the portfolio and will not have a significant negative impact on the growth of net investment income the following chart presents the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets 

tmk 2018 form 10k 



should interest rates especially longterm rates rise torchmarks net investment income would benefit due to higher interest rates on new purchases while such a rise in interest rates could adversely affect the fair value of the fixed maturities portfolio we could withstand an increase in interest rates of approximately 30 to 35 basis points before the net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio as of december 31 2018  would be eliminated should interest rates increase further than that we would not be concerned with potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio because we have the intent and more importantly the ability to hold our fixed maturities to maturity 

required interest on net insurance policy liabilities  reduces net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to “fund” the required interest included in the insurance segments as such it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments as discussed in note 14business segments   management believes this provides a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force 

the great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interestrate protection policies not investment products and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for longduration insurance products which mandates that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business each calendar year we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year and cannot be changed the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in as such the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years changes in the overall weightedaverage discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weightedaverage discount rate due to the size of our in force business 

since actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs due to the strength of our underwriting margins we do not expect an extended lowinterestrate environment to cause a loss recognition event

financing costs  for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations 

  

analysis of financing costs 

dollar amounts in thousands 

  

in 2018  financing costs increased primarily due to higher interest rates on the shortterm debt more information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the financial   condition  section of this report and in note 11—debt  

  

realized gains and losses    our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future since benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

despite our intent to hold fixed maturity investments for a long period of time investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses generally occur only incidentally usually as the result of bonds sold because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by write downs due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit 

tmk 2018 form 10k 

therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause periodtoperiod trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

investment acquisitions    torchmark’s investment policy calls for investing primarily in investment grade fixed maturities that meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities we believe this strategy is appropriate since our expected future cash flows are generally stable and predictable and the likelihood that we will need to sell invested assets to raise cash is low if longerterm securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available we do not relax our quality objectives instead we consider investing in shorterterm or lower yielding securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors 

during calendar years 2016  through 2018  torchmark invested predominately in fixed maturity securities primarily in corporate bonds with longerterm maturities the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases for the last three years the effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield commonly referred to as the “worst call date” for noncallable bonds the worstcall date is always the maturity date for callable bonds the worstcall date is the call date that produces the lowest yield   or the maturity date if the yield calculated to the maturity date is lower than the yield calculated to each call date

we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment absent sales and makewhole calls however the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 

  

from 2016  through 2018  acquisitions consisted of securities spanning a diversified range of issuers industry sectors and geographical regions all of the acquired securities were investment grade in addition to the fixed maturity acquisitions torchmark invested 94 million  in other longterm investments in 2018  compared with 55 million  in 2017  and 20 million  in 2016  

new cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations cash received on existing investments and proceeds from dispositions while calls increase funds available for investment as noted earlier in this discussion they can also have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than those of the bonds that were called issuer calls were 146 million  in 2018  371 million  in 2017  and 182 million  in 2016  

approximately 95  of our investments at book value are in a diversified fixed maturity portfolio policy loans which are secured by policy cash values make up 3  of our investments we also have investments in equity securities commercial mortgages and limited partnerships 

we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts we do not participate in securities lending we have no offbalance sheet investments and we do not have any exposure to european sovereign debt at december 31 2018  in the prior year it was announced by the head of the united kingdoms financial conduct authority that they plan to phase out the floating rate london interbank offered rate libor by the end of 2021 uncertainty remains as to what will be the replacement floating rate as of december 31 2018  torchmark had limited assets and liabilities that utilize libor as a benchmark rate we will continue to monitor the progress towards the establishment of a new floating rate

the net unrealized gain position in the fixed maturity portfolio decreased  by 72  from 20 billion  at december 31 2017  to 544 million  at december 31 2018  primarily as a result of an increase in market interest rates

financial condition 

  

liquidity    liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

insurance subsidiary liquidity  the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes the funds to provide for policy benefits the majority of which are paid in future periods are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities to meet these longterm obligations in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restriction the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains while the leading source of the excess cash is investment income due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income 

  

parent company liquidity    cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt operating expenses of the parent company and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders 



for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions  section of note 12—shareholders’ equity  although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company 

shortterm borrowings    an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 750 million which could be extended up to 1 billion while torchmark can request the extension it is not guaranteed in may 2016 torchmark amended the facility to extend the maturity date to may 2021 the amendment also allowed for an additional 100 million term loan as discussed under the caption credit facility  in note 11—debt  the facility is further designated as a backup line of credit for a commercial paper program as well as the standby letters of credit as discussed below as of december 31 2018  we had available 293 million  of additional borrowing capacity under this facility compared with 249 million  a year earlier there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended december 31 2018  

  

torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2019  and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of debt an additional shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing 

  

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from continuing operations were 13 billion  in 2018  compared with 14 billion  in 2017  and 12 billion  in 2016  in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies received proceeds from maturities calls and repayments of fixed maturities in the amount of 344 million  in 2018  compared with 489 million  in 2017  and 236 million  in 2016  

  

our cash and shortterm investments were 184 million  at the end of 2018  compared with 246 million  at the end of 2017  additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed securities that are available for sale in the event of an 

tmk 2018 form 10k 

unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 163 billion  at december 31 2018  however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and the availability of our commercial paper and credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements    as a part of its aforementioned credit facility torchmark had outstanding 155 million  in standby letters of credit at december 31 2018  on march 14 2018 the letters of credit were amended to reduce the amount outstanding from 177 million  as of december 31 2017  these letters are issued among our subsidiaries one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer and have no impact on company obligations as a whole any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of offshore captive reinsurers might require torchmark to obtain thirdparty financing which could cause an insignificant increase in financing costs 

  

as of december 31 2018  we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities all of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 6—commitments and contingencies

subsidiary capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic  has established a riskbased factor approach for determining threshold riskbased capital levels for all insurance companies this approach was designed to assist the regulatory bodies in identifying companies that may require regulatory attention a riskbased capital rbc ratio is typically determined by dividing adjusted total statutory capital by the amount of riskbased capital determined using the naic’s factors if a company’s rbc ratio approaches two times the rbc amount the company must file a plan with the naic for improving their capital levels this level is commonly referred to as “company action level” rbc companies typically hold a multiple of the company action level rbc depending on their particular business needs and risk profile 

our goal is to maintain statutory capital within our insurance subsidiaries at levels necessary to support our current ratings for 2018  torchmark targeted a consolidated company action level rbc ratio of 300 to 320 the company believes this capital level is more than adequate and is sufficient to support its current ratings given the nature of its business and its risk profile due to changes in the insurance company’s capital levels as a result of the new tax legislation effective january 1 2018 the parent company used approximately 150 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in 2018 to provide additional capital to its insurance subsidiaries as of december 31 2018  our consolidated company action level rbc ratio was 326 slightly above our targeted range 

  

torchmark is targeting a consolidated company action level rbc ratio in the range of 300 to 320 for 2019 

shareholders equity  as noted under the caption analysis of share purchases  within this report we have an ongoing share repurchase program 

  

torchmark has continually increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years 



shareholders’ equity was 54 billion  at december 31 2018  compared with 62 billion  at december 31 2017  a decrease  of 816 million  or 13  during the twelve months since december 31 2017  shareholders’ equity was reduced

by 11 billion  of aftertax unrealized losses  as well as 372 million  in share purchases under the repurchase program and an additional 50 million  in share purchases to offset the dilution from stock option exercises shareholders equity was increased by 701 million  of net income during this period 

  

we plan to use excess cash available at the parent company as efficiently as possible in the future possible uses of excess cash flow include but are not limited to share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in securities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that targeted capital levels are maintained in our companies if market conditions are favorable we currently expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds 

we maintain a significant availableforsale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policy liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets while a majority of invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity 

due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets from time to time the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity due to the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following table presents selected data related to our capital resources additionally the table presents the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on the fixed maturity portfolio from shareholders equity is considered nongaap below we include the reconciliation to gaap

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits    due to the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies  

  

approximately 88  of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2018  were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies  under the caption future policy benefits  otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the consolidated financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs   certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs such as advertising related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note 1—significant accounting policies  under the caption deferred acquisition costs  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  additionally the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies known as the value of insurance acquired voba is included in deferred acquisition costs our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1—significant accounting policies  

  

over 99 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2018  were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2018  

  

less than 1 of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31 2018  

  

policy claims and other benefits payable   this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

valuation of fixed maturities   we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to 

tmk 2018 form 10k 

manage risk we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk   sensitivity  in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition  in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

at times the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening and accordingly to unrealized losses on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in note 1—significant accounting policies  and in note 4—investments   under the captions fair value measurements  in both notes 

  

impairment of investments    we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value and that have become impaired in value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an otherthantemporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies   and the discussions under the captions investments  and realized gains and   losses  in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans    we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plan covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2018  our gross liability under these plans was 556 million  but was offset by assets of 393 million  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans for example a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2018  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2018

annuity products include singlepremium and flexiblepremium deferred annuities annuities in each of the three years ended december 31 2017  comprised less than 1 of premium 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency investment income expenses and target profit margins these assumptions are based on company experience and projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports pharmacy data doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in note 1—significant accounting policies   reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

  

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities approximately 96  of our invested assets at fair value are fixed maturities at december 31 2017   see   note 4—investments  and management’s discussion and analysis   

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

risk based capital the naic requires that a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is based on its proportional share of the premium in each state a significant portion of assessments are recoverable as offsets against state premium taxes see note 15—commitments and contingencies   for current assessment  

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to

constitute a holding company system torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in indiana nebraska ohio and new york 

insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a regulated industry populated by many public and private companies we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the industry each of which has its own set of risks 

  

the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits development and retention of producing agents are critical to support sales growth in this market because our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts of the life insurance policies sold are typically lower than those of policies sold in higherincome markets compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and motivates producing agents to increase sales is also critical in globe life direct response continuous development of new methods of reaching the consumer and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits 

  

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  we primarily serve the middleincome market for individual protection life and health insurance and as a result we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of a significant sustained economic downturn or otherwise then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging and our policyholders may choose to defer or stop payment of insurance premiums altogether economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under investment risks  below 

  

variations in expectedtoactual rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test expectedtoactual results actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set accordingly we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments significant adverse variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could result in increased policy obligations and negatively affect our profit margins and income 

  

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways including limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies 

  

rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of capital actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could potentially have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations by limiting our access to capital markets increasing the cost of debt or impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations thereby potentially limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

ratings reflect only the rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control in addition rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered the models changes to the models 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

could impact the rating agencies’ judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company there can be no assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

our life products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish  we have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches two of which are labor unions and sales via globe life direct response solicitation deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to direct response marketing initiatives could negatively affect our life insurance business 

  

health insurance marketplace risks 

the health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny  regulatory changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health businesses the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our health insurance business 

  

competition in the health insurance market can be significant  sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors in addition some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or under price new sales in order to gain market share we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms accordingly changes in the competitive landscape including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products 

  

obtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain health insurance policies is critical  a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance including conditions under which the premiums for such policies may be increased is highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are typically necessary obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability and thus our business financial condition and results of operations 

information security and technology risks 

  

the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the company could compromise secure data thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations our business operations are highly dependent upon information technology systems to provide efficient and resilient business operations malicious actors employee errors or disasters affecting these information systems could impair our business operations regulatory compliance and financial condition to the extent our information systems may be breached by malicious actors employee malfeasance or technological attacks an attacker could circumvent security measures in order to access alter or delete customer or proprietary information from our systems or to render our systems unavailable for business use additionally we may not become aware of sophisticated cyber attacks for some time after they occur thereby increasing the companys exposure we may have to incur significant costs to address or remediate interruptions threats and vulnerabilities in our information and technology systems and to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements related thereto these risks are heightened as the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks increase 

employee errors in the handling of our information or technology systems may inadvertently result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information or an inability to use our information technology systems to efficiently support business operations 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

additionally we anticipate more frequent and sophisticated cyberattacks along with more impactful regulatory oversight models in addition an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access use or disclosure of their confidential information any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter potential customers from purchasing our products result in the loss of existing customers subject us to significant civil and criminal liability or require us to incur significant technical legal or other expenses 

in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an industrial accident a blackout or a terrorist attack or war our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees agents or customers for a period of time  a disaster or natural catastrophe an industrial accident terrorist attack or war may make our information systems unavailable to support business operations for a period of time which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations even if our employees are able to report to work they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and existing contingency plans cannot function as designed 

reputational risk 

  

damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business  negative publicity through traditional media internet social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts the ability to market our products and the persistency of our block of inforce policies as discussed above in information security and technology risks  the company could be subjected to adverse publicity as a result of a significant security breach 

investment risks 

  

our investments are subject to market and credit risks significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values our investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed maturity and shortterm investments issued by corporations where we are exposed to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on an investment the concentration of these investments in any particular issuer industry group of related industries or geographic areas increases this risk factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels consisting of both treasury rate and credit spread financial market performance disruptions in credit markets general economic conditions legislative changes particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control 

additionally as the majority of our investments are longerterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity significant increases in interest rates or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable in that case the unrealized loss will be realized at which point we would take an impairment charge reducing our net income 

  

we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all significant downgrades of issuers could negatively impact our riskbased capital ratios leading to potential downgrades by our rating agencies potential reduction in future dividend capacity andor higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required 

  

changes in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities while we attempt to manage our investments to earn an excess investment income spread we can give no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

increases in interest rates could cause the fair value of securities within our bond portfolio to decline a rise in interest rates could also result in certain policyholders surrendering their annuity policies for cash thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate bonds if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations in such a case realized losses could result from such sales and could adversely affect our statutory income and results of operations 

liquidity risks 

  

our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available primarily dividends from our insurance subsidiaries as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity include a variety of shortterm and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper longterm debt intercompany financing and reinsurance 

the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on regulations by their states of domicile  accordingly impairments in assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us a principal source of our cash flow 

  

we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries although we do not anticipate changes changes in laws or regulations could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses additionally if our insurance subsidiaries were unable to obtain approval of our health premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities their profitability and their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us could be negatively impacted limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital should interest rates rise in the future the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced in addition if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability and cost of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity were to decrease due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility as a result our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

regulatory risks 

  

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders not our investors state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising licensing of agents policy forms capital adequacy solvency reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business should these regulatory changes occur we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of such laws and regulations which may change from time to time if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities andor impose substantial fines 

  

we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives in recent years there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries by insurance regulatory authorities which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our agents or employees are improper such actions could result in substantial fines penalties andor prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to our practices that may in some cases limit our ability to grow impact regulatory capital requirements or otherwise negatively impact our profitability 

  

currently the us federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance however the doddfrank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 established a federal insurance office fio charged with monitoring systemic risk exposure in the insurance industry and a financial stability oversight council fsoc which serves to identify and respond to risks and emerging threats to us financial systems a center for consumer information and insurance oversight cciio established under the department of health and human services is charged with overseeing implementation of the affordable care act aca the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct oversight or regulation of the insurance industry we cannot predict what impact if any the ongoing operations of the fio fsoc and cciio as well as any other proposals or executive action for federal oversight or regulation of insurance could have on our business results of operations or financial condition 

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs or negatively impact our insurance subsidiaries capital changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry including the products insurers offer could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries capital or limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to sell certain of their products 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may affect our financial statements reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap and accounting practices as promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners’ statutory accounting practices naic sap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time many of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

noncompliance with restrictions on customer and consumer privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive customer and consumer information maintain its confidentiality could materially adversely affect our reputation and business operations the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries we are and in the future may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants and in certain of these matters the plaintiffs are seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis however the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states in which we operate juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit 

  

our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases the costs of settlement or judgments against us or changes in our operations that could result from litigation substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material adverse financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation which in turn could materially harm our business and our business prospects 

actual or alleged misclassification of independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries could result in adverse legal tax or financial consequences a significant portion of our sales agents are independent contractors although we believe we have properly classified such individuals a risk nevertheless exists that a court the irs or other authority will take the position that those sales agents are employees the laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of workers are subject to change and differing interpretations which we cannot predict 

if there is an adverse determination regarding the classification of some or all of the independent contractors at our insurance subsidiaries by a court or governmental agency we could incur significant costs with respect to payroll tax liabilities employee benefits wage payments fines judgments andor legal settlements any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any resulting reclassification could necessitate significant changes in our affected insurance subsidiaries’ business models 

catastrophic event risk 

  

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a pandemic hurricane earthquake or manmade catastrophes including acts of terrorism or war which may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements  and notes  thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully explained in note 14—business segments  the insurance product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and the administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is 

  

net investment income 

less 

required interest on net policy liabilities 

financing costs 

  

the tables in note 14—business segments  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2017

current year highlights 

 

 

 

 

the following represents net income and net operating income from continuing operations for the 3 years ended december 31 2017 

 

net income as a roe and net operating income as a roe  excluding net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio   in 2016 were 120 and 146 respectively and 119 and 145 respectively in 2015 net operating income as a roe excluding net unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio is considered a nongaap measure management utilizes this measure to view the business without the effect of the unrealized gains or losses which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates on the availableforsale portfolio 

summary of operations net income was 15 billion  in 2017  compared with 550 million  in 2016  this sharp increase was due to an 874 million increase to net income primarily relating to a reduction of deferred income tax liabilities resulting from enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax legislation see further discussion below net income also increased  in 2016  from 527 million  in 2015  on a diluted per common share basis 2017  net income rose   

tmk 2017 form 10k 

172  to 1222  after an 8   increase  in 2016  again largely related to implementation of the tax legislation without the impact of the tax legislation net income per diluted common share would have been 488 net income per diluted common share in 2016   rose  to 449  from 416  in 2015  the per share results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program each year’s per share net income was affected by realized investment gains losses which were 015  006  and 005  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively more information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses  in this report 

net operating income from continuing operations rose each year over the prior year from 523 million  in 2015  to 549 million  in 2016  to 574 million  in 2017  net operating income is the consolidated total of segment profits after tax and as such is considered a nongaap measure net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure see note 14—business segments   for a discussion of the usefulness and purpose of this measure  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments additionally net income was affected by certain significant and unusual nonoperating items in each of the years 2015  through 2017  we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are nonoperating items when evaluating the results of current operations and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods 

tax cuts and jobs act of 2017   on december 22 2017 the tax legislation was enacted which changed existing tax law including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the company recorded 877 million of tax benefits in net income as a result of remeasuring its deferred tax liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate as of the date of enactment based on the analysis of the tax legislation the company was able to determine that this amount is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the tax legislation in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 however the company will continue to analyze relevant information to complete the accounting for income taxes which may result in an adjustment to income tax expense in 2018 the accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 us corporate income tax returns are filed later in 2018 in addition the company early adopted asu 201802 income statement—reporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income  and recorded a 252 million reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income  to retained earnings  to eliminate the stranded tax effects associated with the tax rate change primarily relating to the unrealized gains and losses on the availableforsale fixed maturity portfolio more information concerning income taxes is provided in note 8—income taxes  

there will be substantial longterm benefits from the tax legislation due to the taxation of future profits at the new 21 tax rate looking forward we are anticipating the effective tax rate on our net operating income before stock compensation expense to decrease and be in the range of 19 to 20 despite the lower expected tax rate for financial reporting purposes in the short and intermediate term we do not anticipate a significant reduction in our current tax expense as benefits of the lower tax rate will be virtually offset by several provisions included in the tax legislation that increase the companys current taxable income

analysis of profitability by segment 

dollar amounts in thousands 



the life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented this segment contributed 31 million  in 2017  and 4 million  in 2016  to the growth in our underwriting margin also contributing to growth in income in both years was our health insurance segment which provided 9 million  of additional margin in 2017  and 6 million  in 2016  

  

excess investment income the measure of profitability of our investment segment increased   7  to 239 million  from the prior year amount of 224 million  in 2016  excess investment income increased   2  investment yields continue to be pressured by investing at yields lower than the yield on dispositions and the average yield on the portfolio 

  

total revenues rose   6  in 2017  to 42 billion  or 221 million  over the prior year total of 39 billion  life premium rose   5  or 117 million  in 2017  to 23 billion  life premium increased   116 million  in 2016  to 22 billion  net investment income rose   41 million  or 5  in 2017  and rose   4  or 33 million  in 2016  health premium increased   3  to 976 million  in 2017  and contributed 29 million  to 2017  revenue growth after having gained   2  to 948 million  in 2016  health premium contributed 22 million  to 2016  revenue growth 

  

life insurance premium and underwriting margins have grown in each of the last three years ended december 31 2017  the increase  in life premium was driven by sales growth and improvements in persistency while premium and underwriting margins grew margin as a percent of premium remained flat  in 2017  at 26  after decreasing  from 27  to 26  from 2015  to 2016  net life sales increased  in 2017  to 416 million  net life sales were flat between 2015  and 2016  the life insurance segment is discussed further in this report under the caption life insurance  

  

health insurance premium income increased   3  to 976 million  in 2017  health net sales rose   9  to 158 million  during 2017  due to both individual and group sales group sales vary significantly from period to period due to the 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

impact of large groups that are sold from timetotime firstyear collected health premium fell   3  to 136 million  from the prior year total of 140 million  as a result of higher net sales in medicare supplement in the fourth quarter of 2015  that positively affected the 2016  firstyear collected premium health margins as a percentage of premium were flat at   22  with underwriting income increasing  to 220 million  for 2017  due to the growth in premium income underwriting income was 210 million  in 2016  compared with 204 million  in 2015  the health insurance segment is discussed further in this report under the caption health insurance  

we do not currently market annuities see the caption annuities  for discussion of the annuity segment 

  

excess investment income is based on three major components net investment income required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to insurance products and financing costs in 2017  net investment income rose   5  compared with 4  in 2016  at the same time our investment portfolio grew   6  in 2017  and 2016  on an amortized cost basis in recent years the percentage growth in net investment income has been less than the growth in the overall investment portfolio due primarily to new investments being made at yield rates lower than the yield rates on dispositions and the average yield on the portfolio the growth rate of net investment income is impacted at times by a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested during which the funds are held in cash in addition torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments and increase net investment income the growth in the investment portfolio has been augmented in 2017 and 2016 due to the receipt of certain receivables that had accumulated under our medicare part d business 

  

the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets the lower newmoney yields resulting from the low interest rate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow at approximately the same rate that net policy liabilities have grown financing costs which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and shortterm debt are also deducted from net investment income financing costs in 2017   increased   1  to 85 million  from 83 million  in 2016  the additional interest expense resulted primarily from an increase in the cost of our shortterm borrowings and in lesser part from the issuance of our new 5275 junior subordinated debt security thirtysix days before the repayment of our 5875 junior subordinated debt security 

  

insurance administrative expenses were up   71  in 2017  when compared with the prior year period and increased  to 64  as a percentage of premium from 63  in 2016  and 62  in 2015  the increase in administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase in other employee costs and investments in information technology corporate and other expenses were up primarily due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense reflecting torchmarks higher share price as compared with the same period a year ago and recognition of a onetime increase in stockbased compensation expense due to the tax legislation

share purchases 

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the excess cash flow at the parent company general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess cash flow excess cash flow at the parent company is primarily comprised of dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries less interest expense paid on its debt dividends paid to torchmark shareholders and other limited operating activities additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the resulting tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises the board of directors has authorized the company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management in consultation with the board determines to be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the last three years

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows the following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations as described in note 14—business segments  

life insurance 

life insurance is our largest insurance segment with 2017  life premium representing 70  of total premium life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 72  of the total in 2017  additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium”

the american income exclusive agency  has historically marketed primarily to members of labor unions while labor unions are still the core market for this agency american income has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups third party internet vendor leads and referrals to help ensure sustainable growth this agency is torchmark’s largest contributor to life premium of any distribution channel at 43  of torchmark’s 2017  total this group produced premium income of 999 million  an increase of   9  over the prior year total of 913 million  after having risen   10  in 2016  firstyear collected premium was 183 million  compared to 174 million  in 2016  an increase of   5  firstyear collected premium rose   11  in 2016  net sales increased   6  to 223 million  in 2017  over the 2016  total of 210 million  net sales increased   6  in 2016  over the 2015  total of 198 million  sales growth in our captive agencies is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force the american income agencys average agent count rose   4  to 6962  in 2017  the average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the period 

the american income exclusive agency continues to focus on growing and strengthening middle management to support sustainable growth of the agency force to accomplish this the agency places an emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train its agents including more homeoffice and webinar training programs these programs are designed to provide each agent from new recruits to top level managers coaching and instruction specifically designed for their level of experience and responsibility we have made considerable investments in information technology in support of the agency including the launching of a lead mapping and management tool to the agency force we anticipate this tool will help the agency enhance agent productivity and agent retention 

the globe life direct response  unit offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of directtoconsumer marketing approaches which include direct mailings insert media and electronic media these different approaches support and complement one another in the unit’s efforts to reach the consumer the globe life direct response 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

channel’s growth has been fueled by constant innovation in recent years electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology and has focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center we continually introduce new initiatives in this unit in an attempt to increase response rates 

while the juvenile market is an important source of sales it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders who are more likely to respond favorably to a globe life direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 

globe life direct response’s life premium income rose   4  to 813 million  representing 35  of torchmark’s total life premium during 2017  life premium in this channel increased   5  in 2016  to 783 million  over the 2015  total of 747 million  net sales of 136 million  for this group decreased   10  from 150 million  in 2016  after a 9   decrease  in 2016  due to operational changes designed to maximize underwriting margin dollars we expect sales to decline consistent with this recent trend through 2018  firstyear collected premium decreased   7  to 92 million  in 2017  after having decreased   7  in 2016  

the liberty national exclusive agency  markets individual and group life insurance to middleincome customers life premium income for this agency was 275 million  in 2017  an increase of   2  from 270 million  in 2016  life premium income in 2015  totaled 271 million  net sales increased   17  during 2017  to 47 million  over the 2016  total of 40 million  net sales in 2016   increased   12  the continued increases in net sales reflect changes in structure of the agency that were put in place several years ago middle management has also grown within the agency which will help continue this growth firstyear collected premium increased   14  to 33 million  during 2017  and increased   6  in 2016  to 29 million  

the liberty average producing agent count increased from 1715  in 2016  to 2017  in 2017  we continue to execute our long term plan to grow this agency through expansion from smalltown markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated lesspenetrated areas will help create long term agency growth additionally the agencys prospecting training program has helped to improve the ability of agents to develop new work site marketing business 

the other agencies  distribution channels offering life insurance include the military agency the ua independent agency which predominantly writes health insurance and various smaller distribution channels the other agencies contributed 220 million  of life premium income or 10  of torchmark’s total in 2017  but contributed only 2  of net sales for the year

health insurance 

health insurance sold by torchmark includes primarily medicare supplement insurance critical illness coverage accident coverage and other limitedbenefit supplemental health products in this analysis all health coverage plans other than medicare supplement are classified as limitedbenefit plans 

health premium accounted for 30  of our total premium in 2017  while the health underwriting margin accounted for 26  of total underwriting margin reflective of the lower underwriting margin as a percent of premium for health compared with life insurance as noted under the caption life insurance  we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health due to life’s superior profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income

the ua independent agency  consists of independent agencies appointed with torchmark who may also sell for other companies the ua independent agency was torchmark’s largest health agency in terms of health premium income in 2017  premium income was 364 million  representing 37  of torchmark’s total health premium net sales were 61 million  or 39  of torchmark’s health sales this agency is also torchmark’s largest producer of medicare supplement insurance with medicare supplement premium income of 353 million  the ua independent agency represents 74  of all torchmark medicare supplement premium and 92  of medicare supplement net sales medicare supplement premium in this agency rose   3  in 2017  total health premium increased   3  in 2017  and 2016  medicare supplement net sales increased   9  in 2017  from the prior year due to increases in individual and group sales group medicare supplement sales have historically fluctuated from period to period 

the family heritage exclusive agency  primarily markets limitedbenefit supplemental health insurance in nonurban areas most of their policies include a cashback feature such as a return of premium whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy management expects to grow this agency through geographic expansion and continuing incorporation of torchmark’s recruiting systems the family heritage agency contributed 57 million  in net sales in 2017  compared with 51 million  in 2016  and 50 million  in 2015  health premium income was 254 million  in 2017  representing 26  of torchmark’s

the liberty national exclusive agency  represented 20  of all torchmark health premium income at 196 million  in 2017  the liberty agency markets limitedbenefit supplemental health products consisting primarily of critical illness insurance much of liberty’s health business is now generated through work site marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees in 2017  health premium income declined   3  after declining   4  during 2016  liberty’s health premium decline has been due primarily to its declining medicare supplement block libertys firstyear collected premium increased   2  to 16 million  in 2017  compared with an increase of   8  in 2016  reflecting the steady increase in net sales of limitedbenefit plans in the agency 

other distribution  certain of our other distribution channels market health products although their main emphasis is on life insurance on a combined basis they accounted for 17  of health premium in 2017  and 16  in 2016  the american income exclusive agency primarily markets accident plans the direct response group markets primarily medicare supplements to employer or unionsponsored groups direct response added 6 million  of medicare supplement net sales in 2017  and 2016  and 5 million  in 2015    

in 2016 and 2015 the affordable care act aca imposed an annual fee to health insurance issuers offering commercial health insurance as well as another fee for premium stabilization these fees totaled 621 thousand  and 12 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively there were no fees for 2017  

annuities our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2017  and 2016  were 125 billion  and 129 billion  respectively underwriting income was 106 million  94 million  and 46 million  for the three years ended december 31 2017 respectively 

while the fixed annuity account balance has been declining slightly year over year underwriting income has increased each year over the prior year the significant increase in underwriting income in 2016 was primarily due to a slowdown in amortization as assumptions were adjusted to reflect longer retention of the annuity block than previously estimated as a result of the continuing low interest rate environment policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year the majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are based on a function of account size and time lapsed since deposit a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements which can result in negative net policy obligations we do not currently market annuity products favoring instead protectionoriented life and health insurance products therefore we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward

insurance administrative expenses were up   71  in 2017  when compared with the prior year after increasing   56  during 2016  as a percentage of total premium insurance administrative expenses increased  to 64  in 2017  from 63  in 2016  and 62   2015  total operating expenses increased   109  in 2017  after increasing   37  in 2016  the increase in other employee costs was due primarily to higher pension expense driven by lower interest rates 

the increase in information technology costs was due to investments that will enhance our customer experience expand our data analytics capabilities modernize our systems in order to improve our ability to react quickly to future changes and bolster our information security programs 

the increase in stockbased compensation expense was primarily due to higher expense associated with equity awards reflecting torchmarks higher share price and higher stock option values as compared with the same period a year ago the increase also reflects a onetime increase in stockbased compensation expense due to the effects of the tax legislation as previously discussed

investments we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14—business segments   it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” 

we also view excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used 71 billion  of excess cash flow at the parent company to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives if we had not used this excess cash to repurchase shares but had instead invested it in interestbearing assets we would have earned more investment income and had more shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  



 

excess investment income increased   15 million  or 7  during 2017  after increasing 2  during 2016  the rate of growth was higher in 2017 than in 2016 in part because excess investment income during 2016 was negatively impacted by an increase in financing costs attributable to the early refinancing of our 6375 senior notes as is discussed below in the discussion of our financing costs in addition the growth rate in 2017 was positively impacted by the investment of positive cash flows relating to the collection in 2016 and 2017 of various receivables that had accumulated in prior years in the medicare part d business 

excess investment income per diluted common share increased   10  during 2017  after increasing   6  during 2016  excess investment income per diluted common share generally increases at a faster pace than excess investment income because the number of diluted shares outstanding generally decreases from year to year as a result of our share repurchase program 

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income which increased at a compound annual growth rate of 4 during the last three years growth in net investment income has been negatively impacted in recent years by the declining interest rate environment during which time we have invested new money and reinvested the 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

proceeds from bonds that matured or were called or otherwise disposed of at yield rates less than what we earned on these bonds before their maturity or disposition we currently expect that the average annual turnover rate of fixed maturity assets during the next five years will not exceed 1 to 3 of the portfolio and will not have a significant negative impact on the growth of net investment income presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets 



should interest rates rise especially longterm rates torchmarks net investment income would benefit due to higher interest rates on new purchases while such a rise in interest rates could adversely affect the fair value of the fixed maturities portfolio we could withstand an increase in interest rates of approximately 100 to 105 basis points before the net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio as of december 31 2017  would be eliminated should interest rates increase further than that we would not be concerned with potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio because we have the intent and more importantly the ability to hold our fixed maturities to maturity 

required interest on net insurance policy liabilities r educes net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to “fund” the required interest included in the insurance segments as such it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments as discussed in note 14business segments   management believes this provides a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force the great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interestrate protection policies not investment products and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for longduration insurance products which mandates that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business each calendar year we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year and cannot be changed the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in as such the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years changes in the overall weightedaverage discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weightedaverage discount rate due to the size of our in force business 

since actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weightedaverage discount rate of our in force block we do not expect an extended lowinterestrate environment to cause a loss recognition event

financing costs increased   1 million  or 1  from 2016  to 2017  in 2017  interest on shortterm debt increased because of the increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on such debt financing costs also increased   7 million  or 9  from 2015  to 2016  due primarily to the additional interest expense on our funded debt associated with the issuance of a 6125 junior subordinated debt security seventy days before the maturity and repayment of the 6375 senior notes more information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the financial   condition  section of this report and in note 11—debt  

  

realized gains and losses    our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

despite our intent to hold fixed maturity investments for a long period of time investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses generally occur only incidentally usually as the result of bonds sold because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by write downs due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause periodtoperiod trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

investment acquisitions  torchmark’s investment policy calls for investing in fixed maturities that are investment grade and meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities we believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable if longerterm securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available we do not relax our quality objectives but instead consider investing in shorter term or lower yielding securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors 

during calendar years 2015  through 2017  torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities primarily in corporate bonds with longerterm maturities the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases for the last three years the effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield commonly referred to as the “worst call date” for noncallable bonds the worstcall date is always the maturity date for callable bonds the worstcall date is the call date that produces the lowest yield typically the first call date

 we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment absent sales however the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 

  

from 2015  through 2017  acquisitions consisted of securities spanning a diversified range of issuers industry sectors and geographical regions all of the acquired securities were investment grade in addition to the fixed maturity acquisitions torchmark invested 55 million  in other longterm investments in 2017  compared with 20 million  in 2016  and 32 million  in 2015  

new cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations and interest received on existing investments the amount of cash available for investment in 2016 was greater than 2015 due in part to the collection of various receivables from our medicare part d business  in some years a significant amount of new investments can be derived from proceeds from dispositions including issuer calls while calls increase funds available for investment as noted earlier in this discussion they can also have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than those of the bonds that were called issuer calls were 371 million  in 2017  182 million  in 2016  and 178 million  in 2015

our investment policy regarding fixed maturities is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts we do not participate in securities lending we have no offbalance sheet investments and we do not have any exposure to european sovereign debt at december 31 2017  our exposure to puerto rican obligations is insignificant 

market risk sensitivity torchmark’s investment securities are exposed to interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since 95  of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixedrate investments the portfolio is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio rising and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline under normal market conditions we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and the intent to hold these investments to maturity the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however as is permitted by gaap these liabilities are not recorded at fair value 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interestrate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december 31 2017  and 2016  this table measures the effect of a parallel shift in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points

financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

insurance subsidiary liquidity the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes the funds to provide for policy benefits the majority of which are paid in future periods are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities to meet these longterm obligations in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restriction the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains while the leading source of the excess cash is investment income due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income 

  

parent company liquidity cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt operating expenses of the parent and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders in 2017  the parent received 454 million  of cash dividends from its subsidiaries compared with 438 million  in 2016  and 466 million  in 2015  including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations shareholder dividends and other expenses but before share repurchases the parent company had excess cash flow in 2017  of approximately 330 million compared with 311 million in 2016  and 358 million in 2015  

parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes such as insurance subsidiary capital or financing needs strategic acquisitions additional shareholder dividends or share repurchases in 2018  it is expected that the parent company will receive approximately 450 million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries and that approximately 320 to 330 million will be available as excess cash flow certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions  section of note 12—shareholders’ equity  although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company 

shortterm borrowings an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 750 million which could be extended up to 1 billion while torchmark can request the extension it is not guaranteed in may 2016 torchmark amended the facility to extend the maturity date to may 2021 the amendment also allowed for an additional 100 million term loan as discussed under the caption credit facility  in note 11—debt  the facility is further designated as a backup line of credit for a commercial paper program as well as the standby letters of credit as discussed below as of december 31 2017  we had available 249 million  of additional borrowing capacity under this facility compared with 310 million  a year earlier there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended december 31 2017  

  

in summary torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2018  and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of additional debt additional borrowings on our shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing 

  

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from continuing operations were 14 billion  in 2017  compared with 12 billion  in 2016  and 11 billion  in 2015  in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies received proceeds from maturities calls and repayments of fixed maturities in the amount of 489 million  in 2017  compared with 236 million  in 2016  and 376 million  in 2015  

  

our cash and shortterm investments were 246 million  at yearend 2017  and 148 million  at yearend 2016  additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

securities had a fair value of 170 billion  at december 31 2017  however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as a part of its aforementioned credit facility torchmark had outstanding 177 million  in standby letters of credit at december 31 2017  and 2016  these letters are issued among our subsidiaries one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer and have no impact on company obligations as a whole any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of offshore captive reinsurers might require torchmark to obtain thirdparty financing which could cause an insignificant increase in financing costs 

  

as of december 31 2017  we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities all of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 15—commitments and contingencies  

the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december 31 2017

capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in   note 11—debt   and the current maturity of funded debt   longterm funded debt and shareholders’ equity a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 11  

  

debt  the carrying value of the longterm debt was 11 billion  at december 31 2017 the same as a year earlier 

on november 17 2017 torchmark completed the issuance and sale of 125 million  in aggregate principal of torchmark’s 5275  junior subordinated debentures due 2057 the debentures were sold in a private placement pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933 the initial purchaser of the 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

debentures was outside the united states the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures were 1233 million  after giving effect to the discount payable to the initial purchaser and expenses of the offering of the debentures torchmark used the net proceeds from the offering of the debentures to repay the 125 million  outstanding principal of the 5875  junior subordinated debentures that were due december 15 2052 and that were callable beginning december 15 2017 

on april 5 2016 torchmark completed the issuance and sale of 300 million  aggregate principal amount of torchmark’s 6125  junior subordinated debentures due 2056 the debentures were sold pursuant to torchmark’s shelf registration statement on form s3 filed september 25 2015 the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures were 290 million  after giving effect to the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering of the debentures torchmark used the net proceeds from the offering of the debentures to repay the 250 million  outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest of 8 million  on its 6375  senior notes that were due june 15 2016 the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 

  

subsidiary capital for the past several years our insurance subsidiaries have targeted a capital ratio of approximately 325 of company action level regulatory capital under riskbased capital rbc standards a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital at december 31 2017  our insurance subsidiaries had an aggregate rbc ratio of 314 a decrease in the ratio from the prior year of 324 due to the reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the tax legislation previously discussed in the results of operations  in this report should the naic adjust the rbc factors in 2018 as expected to take into account the lower tax rate we would expect a further reduction in our consolidated rbc ratio for the year ending december 31 2018 at this time target rbc levels for 2018 are yet to be determined pending discussion with regulators and rating agencies management believes more than sufficient liquidity exists at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the targeted ratio 

shareholders equity  as noted under the caption analysis of share repurchases  in this report we have an ongoing share repurchase program under this program we acquired 4 million  shares at a cost of 325 million  in 2017  5 million  shares at a cost of 311 million  in 2016  and 6 million  shares for 359 million  in 2015  the majority of purchased shares are retired each year please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption summary of operations  in this report 

  

torchmark has continually increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years in the first quarter of 2015  it was increased to 0135  per share from 01267 per share in the first quarter of 2016  it was raised to 014  per share finally in the first quarter of 2017  dividends were raised to 015  per share 

  

shareholders’ equity was 62 billion  at december 31 2017  compared with 46 billion  at december 31 2016  a 17 billion  or 36   increase  during the twelve months since december 31 2016  shareholders’ equity was reduced by 325 million  in share purchases under the repurchase program and 88 million  to offset the dilution from stock option exercises however it was increased by 15 billion  of net income 874 million of which was attributed to a tax adjustment as a result of the tax legislation and 870 million  of aftertax unrealized gains of which 275 million was attributed to a tax adjustment as a result of the tax legislation 

  

we plan to use excess cash available at the parent company as efficiently as possible in the future possible uses of excess cash flow include but are not limited to share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in securities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that targeted capital levels are maintained in our companies if market conditions are favorable we currently expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds 

we maintain a significant availableforsale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets while invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity 

due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets from time to time the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity because of the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following table presents selected data related to our capital resources additionally the table presents the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on the fixed maturity portfolio from shareholders equity is considered nongaap below we include the reconciliation to gaap

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries such punitive damage claims may have the potential for significant adverse results since torchmark and its subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 15—commitments and contingencies   

tmk 2017 form 10k 

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits    due to the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies  

  

approximately 87  of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2017  were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies  under the caption future policy benefits  otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended december 31 2017  

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs  certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note 1—significant accounting policies  under the caption deferred acquisition costs  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  additionally the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies known as the value of insurance purchased is included in deferred acquisition costs our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1—significant accounting policies  

  

over 99 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2017  were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2017  

  

less than 1 of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31 2017  

  

policy claims and other benefits payable  this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

valuation of fixed maturities  we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to manage risk 

tmk 2017 form 10k 

we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk   sensitivity  in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition  in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

at times the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in note 1—significant accounting policies  and in note 4—investments   under the captions fair value measurements  in both notes 

  

impairment of investments  we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value and that have become impaired in value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an otherthantemporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies   and the discussions under the captions investments  and realized gains and   losses  in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans  we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2017  our gross liability under these plans was 603 million  but was offset by assets of 378 million  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans for example a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2017  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2017

annuities 

  

annuity products include singlepremium and flexiblepremium deferred annuities annuities in each of the three years ended december 31 2016  comprised less than 1 of premium 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses these assumptions are based on company experience and projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports pharmacy data doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

  

index to financial statements 

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in note 1—significant accounting policies in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements  reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

  

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities fixed maturities represented 96  of total investments at fair value at december 31 2016   see   note 4—investments   in the  notes to consolidated financial statements  and management’s discussion and analysis   

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is based on its proportional share of the premium in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in indiana nebraska ohio and new york

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a regulated industry populated by many public and private companies we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits as our insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts of life policies sold are lower than those of policies sold in the higher income market the development and maintenance of directtoconsumer systems and development and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents to support sales growth in this market are critical adequate compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical in globe life direct response continuous development of new methods of reaching the consumer and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits 

  

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  we serve primarily the middleincome market for individual protection life and health insurance and as a result we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of a significant sustained economic downturn or otherwise then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under investment risks  below 

  

variations in expected to actual rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test expectedtoactual results actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set accordingly we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments significant adverse variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could require policy obligations to be increased and negatively affect our profit margins and income 

  

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways including the following limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies 

  

rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could potentially have a negative effect on our operations by limiting our access to capital markets increasing the cost of debt or impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations thereby potentially limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

ratings reflect only the rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control in addition rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated 

index to financial statements 

company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered the models changes to the models could impact the rating agencies’ judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

our life products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish  we have several life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches two of which are labor union members and sales via globe life direct response solicitation deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to direct response marketing initiatives could negatively affect this business 

  

health insurance marketplace risks 

the health insurance market is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny  regulatory changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health businesses the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business 

  

competition in the health insurance market can be significant  sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors in addition some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or underprice new sales in order to gain market share we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms accordingly changes in the competitive landscape including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products 

  

obtaining timely and appropriate premium rate increases for certain health insurance policies is critical  a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability and thus our results of operations and financial condition 

information security and technology risks 

  

the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems at the company could compromise secure data thereby adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations 

our business operations are highly dependent upon information technology systems to provide efficient and resilient business operations malicious actors employee errors or disasters affecting these information systems could impair our business operations regulatory compliance and financial condition to the extent our information systems may be breached by malicious actors employee malfeasance or technological attacks an attacker could circumvent security measures in order to alter or delete customer or proprietary information from our systems in addition we may not become aware of sophisticated or advanced cyber attacks for some time after they occur thereby increasing the companys exposure 

employee errors in the handling of our information or technology systems may inadvertently result in unauthorized access to customer or proprietary information or an inability to use our information technology systems to efficiently support business operations 

in addition an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access use or disclosure of their confidential information any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the 

index to financial statements 

marketplace deter potential customers from purchasing our products result in the loss of existing customers subject us to significant civil and criminal liability or require us to incur significant technical legal or other expenses 

in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an industrial accident a blackout or a terrorist attack or war our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time  a disaster or natural catastrophe an industrial accident terror attack or war may make our information systems unavailable to support business operations for a period of time affecting our systems physical business operations and financial condition even if our employees are able to report to work they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and if existing contingency plans cannot function as designed 

reputational risk 

  

damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business  negative publicity through traditional media internet social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts the ability to market our products and the persistency of our block of inforce policies as discussed above in information security and technology risks the company could be subjected to adverse publicity as a result of a significant security breach 

investment risks 

  

our investments are subject to market and credit risks significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio could potentially result in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values our investment portfolio consists almost exclusively of fixed maturity and shortterm investments a significant portion of our fixed maturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels financial market performance disruptions in credit markets general economic conditions legislative changes particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control 

additionally as the majority of our investments are longerterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity significant increases in interest rates widening of credit spreads or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable in that case the unrealized loss will be realized at which point we would take an impairment charge reducing our net income 

  

we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all significant downgrades of issuers could negatively impact our riskbased capital ratios leading to potential downgrades by our rating agencies potential reduction in future dividend capacity andor higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required 

  

changes in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk that they will fail to earn the level of interest on investments assumed in pricing products and in setting discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities while we attempt to manage our investments to earn an excess investment income spread we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

increases in interest rates could cause the fair value of securities within our bond portfolio to decline a rise in interest rates could also result in certain policyholders surrendering their annuity policies for cash thereby potentially requiring our insurance subsidiaries to liquidate bonds if other sources of liquidity are not available to meet their obligations in such a case realized losses could result from such sales and could adversely affect our statutory income and results of operations 

index to financial statements 

  

liquidity risks 

  

our ability to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available primarily dividends from our insurance subsidiaries as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity include a variety of shortterm and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper longterm debt intercompany financing and reinsurance 

the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are restricted based on regulations by their state of domicile  accordingly impairments in invested assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us a principal source of our cash flow 

  

we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries although we do not anticipate changes changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses additionally if our insurance subsidiaries were unable to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities their profitability and their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us could be negatively impacted limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock 

  

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital should treasury rates increase or credit spreads widen in the future the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced in addition if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability and cost of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if we were to incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility as a result our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected 

index to financial statements 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which they do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders not our investors state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising licensing of agents policy forms capital adequacy solvency reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business should these changes to our business occur we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of such laws and regulations which may change from time to time if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities andor impose substantial fines 

  

we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives in recent years there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries by insurance regulatory authorities which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our agents or employees are improper such actions could result in substantial fines penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may even absent any particular regulatory authority’s interpretation of an issue changing cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to our practices that may in some cases limit our ability to grow impact regulatory capital requirements or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business 

  

currently the us federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance however the doddfrank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 established a federal insurance office fio within the department of the treasury and the affordable care act and a financial stability oversight council fsoc created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight cciio originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct oversight or regulation of the insurance industry we cannot predict what impact if any the fio fsoc and cciio as well as any other proposals for federal oversight or regulation of insurance could have on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry including the products it offers could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income or negatively affect our ability to sell some of our products 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may affect our financial statements reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap and accounting practices as promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners’ statutory accounting practices naic sap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time many of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability

noncompliance with restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality could materially adversely affect our reputation and business operations the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries we are and in the future may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants and in certain of these matters the plaintiffs are seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis however the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states in which we operate juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit 

  

our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases the costs of settlement or judgments against us or changes in our operations that could result from litigation substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation which in turn could materially harm our business and our business prospects 

  

catastrophic event risk 

  

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a pandemic hurricane earthquake or manmade catastrophes including acts of terrorism or war which may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements  and notes  thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully explained in note 14—business segments  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements  the insurance product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and the administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is 

  

net investment income 

less 

required interest on net policy liabilities 

financing costs 

  

the tables in note 14—business segments  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2016  additionally this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrate yeartoyear comparability and which reconciles to net income that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated   financial statements  to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

2      net operating income from continuing operations is the consolidated total of segment profits after tax and as such is considered a nongaap measure see note 14—business segments  for reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure and for discussion of the usefulness and purpose of this measure 

3 income from discontinued operations after tax is included for purposes of reconciling to net income 

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations as shown in the above chart net income was 550 million  in 2016  compared with 527 million  in 2015  net income decreased  in 2015  from 543 million  in 2014  on a diluted per share basis 2016  net income rose   8  to 449  after a 2   increase  in 2015  net income per diluted share in 2015   rose  to 416  from 409  in 2014  the per share results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program each year’s per share net income was affected by realized investment gains losses which were 006  005  and 012  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively more information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses  in this report 

net operating income from continuing operations rose each year over the prior year from 520 million  in 2014  to 523 million  in 2015  to 549 million  in 2016  also as explained in note 14—business segments  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments additionally net income was affected by certain significant and unusual nonoperating items in each of the years 2014  through 2016  we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations accordingly as described in note 14—business segments  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements  we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are nonoperating items when evaluating the results of current operations and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods 

effective july 1 2016 torchmark sold its medicare part d prescription drug plan business to an unaffiliated third party torchmark decided to exit its medicare part d business due to declining margins increased risks higher drug costs and increased administrative and compliance costs this sale allows the company to better focus on its core protection life and health insurance businesses and provides additional capital to invest the financial results of this business are

the life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented this segment contributed 4 million  in 2016  and 13 million  in 2015  to the growth in our underwriting margin also contributing to growth in income in both years was our health insurance segment which provided 6 million  of additional margin in 2016  and 5 million  in 2015  

  

excess investment income the measure of profitability of our investment segment increased  to 224 million  or 2  from the prior year amount of 220 million  in 2015  excess investment income decreased   2  investment yields continue to be pressured by reinvesting proceeds from dispositions at lower rates relative to the fixed maturity assets being disposed of and spreads related to required interest on net policy liabilities throughout the threeyear period excess investment income has also been hampered by a lag in government reimbursements of medicare part d costs the impact of the lost investment income from delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting rules as noted previously the medicare part d business has been classified as discontinued operations 

  

total revenues rose   4  in 2016  to 39 billion  or 169 million  over the prior year total of 38 billion  life premium rose   6  or 116 million  in 2016  to 22 billion  life premium increased   107 million  in 2015  to 21 billion  net investment income rose   16 million  or 2  in 2015  and rose   4  or 33 million  in 2016  health premium increased   2  to 948 million  in 2016  and contributed 22 million  to 2016  revenue growth after having gained   6  to 926 million  in 2015  health premium contributed 56 million  to 2015  revenue growth 

  

life insurance premium and underwriting margins have grown steadily in each of the last three years ended december 31 2016  the increase in life premium was driven by sales growth and improvements in persistency while premium and underwriting margins grew margin as a percent of premium declined  in 2016  to 26  after decreasing from 28  to 27  from 2014  to 2015  these declines were due primarily to higher than expected globe life direct response policy obligations net life sales were flat  in 2016  at 412 million  after increasing 9  in 2015  the life insurance segment is discussed further in this report under the caption life insurance  

  

health insurance premium income increased   2  to 948 million  in 2016  health net sales fell   7  to 145 million  during 2016  as a result of a 20   decrease  in medicare supplement sales the decrease in 2016 medicare supplement net sales was expected due to group sales returning to a more normal level after unusually high sales in 2014 group sales vary significantly from period to period due to the impact of large groups that are sold from time to time firstyear collected health premium fell   11  to 140 million  from the prior year total of 157 million  as a result of a high level of group sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2014  that positively affected the 2015 firstyear collected premium health margins were flat at   22  with underwriting income increasing  to 210 million  for 2016  due to the growth in premium income underwriting income was 204 million  for the same period in 2015  compared with 199 million  in 2014  

  

we do not currently market annuities see the caption annuities  for discussion of the annuity segment 

  

the investment segment’s pretax profitability or excess investment income is based on three major components net investment income required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to insurance products and financing costs in 2016  net investment income rose   4  compared with 2  in 2015  at the same time our investment portfolio grew   6  in 2016  and 3  on an amortized cost basis in 2015  in recent years net investment income has not grown as fast as the portfolio due primarily to new investments being made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed the growth rate of net investment income is sometimes impacted by a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested during which the funds are held in cash in addition torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments and increase net investment income net investment income was negatively impacted during 2014  through 2016  by our medicare part d business under the program we were required to cover certain costs in the current period that are the federal government’s responsibility but are not reimbursed until late in the next calendar year this delay in reimbursement reduced our funds available for investment in each year resulting in reduced investment income 

  

the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets the lower newmoney yields resulting from the 

index to financial statements 

low interest rate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow at approximately the same rate that net policy liabilities have grown financing costs which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and shortterm debt are also deducted from net investment income financing costs in 2016   increased   9  to 83 million  from 77 million  in 2015  the additional interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our new 6125 junior subordinated debt security seventy days before the maturity and repayment of our 6375 senior notes 

  

torchmark’s current investment policy regarding fixed maturities limits new fixed maturity acquisitions to investmentgrade securities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives approximately 96  of our invested assets at fair value are fixed maturities of which 95  were investment grade at december 31 2016  the average quality rating of the portfolio was bbb  the portfolio contains no securities backed by subprime or alta mortgages no direct investment in residential mortgages no credit default swaps or other derivative contracts see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments  in this report and note 4—investments  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of this segment 

insurance administrative expenses were up   56  in 2016  when compared with the prior year period and increased  to 63  as a percentage of premium from 62  in 2015  and 2014  the increase in administrative expenses is primarily due to investments in information technology that will enhance our customer experience improve our data analytic capabilities improve our ability to adapt to future changes and bolster our information security programs stock compensation expense declined   2 million  in 2016  to 263 million  compared with  a decrease of   4 million  in 2015  to 287 million  the decline in stock compensation expense in 2016  and 2015  resulted primarily from lower expense associated with performance shares as well as lower option values on 2016  and 2015  option awards 

  

share purchases 

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the excess cash flow at the parent company general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess cash flow excess cash flow at the parent company is primarily comprised of dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries less interest expense paid on its debt dividends paid to torchmark shareholders and other limited operating activities additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises the board of directors has authorized the company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management in consultation with the board determines to be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the last three years

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows the following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations as described in note 14—business segments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  

index to financial statements 

life insurance 

life insurance is our largest insurance segment with 2016  life premium representing 70  of total premium life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 72  of the total in 2016  additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue net sales is annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of globe life direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a better indicator of the rate of premium growth as compared to annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

life insurance premium rose   6  to 22 billion  in 2016  after having increased   5  in 2015  to 21 billion  life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows

the american income exclusive agency  has historically marketed primarily to members of labor unions while labor unions are still the core market for this agency american income has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help ensure sustainable growth this agency is torchmark’s largest contributor to life premium of any distribution channel at 42  of torchmark’s 2016  total this group produced premium income of 913 million  an increase of   10  over the prior year total of 831 million  after having risen   8  in 2015  firstyear collected premium was 174 million  compared to 156 million  in 2015  an increase of   11  firstyear collected premium rose   16  in 2015  net sales increased   6  to 210 million  in 2016  over the 2015  total of 198 million  net sales increased   15  in 2015  over the 2014  total of 172 million  sales growth in our captive agencies is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force the american income agencys average agent count rose   2  to 6671  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared with 6529  for the same period in 2015  the average producing agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the period the american income exclusive agency has been focusing on growing and strengthening middle management to support sustainable growth of the agency force to accomplish this the agency has placed an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train its agents including more homeoffice and webinar training programs these programs are designed to provide each agent from new recruits to top level managers coaching and instruction specifically designed for their level of experience and responsibility we are also making considerable investments in information technology in support of the agency including the launching of a lead mapping and management tool to the agency force in 2017 we anticipate this tool will enhance overall productivity of agents and improve agent retention 

the globe life direct response  unit offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of directtoconsumer marketing approaches which include direct mailings insert media and electronic media these different approaches support and complement one another in the unit’s efforts to reach the consumer the globe life direct response channel’s growth has been fueled by constant innovation in recent years electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology and has focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center we continually introduce new initiatives in this unit in an attempt to increase response rates 

while the juvenile market is an important source of sales it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders who are more likely to respond favorably to a globe life direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 

globe life direct response’s life premium income rose   5  to 783 million  representing 36  of torchmark’s total life premium during 2016  life premium in this channel increased   6  in 2015  to 747 million  over the 2014  total of 702 million  net sales of 150 million  for this group decreased   9  from 164 million  in 2015  after a 4   increase  in 2015  the sales decline was expected as we have shifted our marketing efforts away from certain segments that no longer meet our profit objectives firstyear collected premium decreased   7  to 98 million  in 2016  after having risen   6  in 2015

the liberty national exclusive agency  markets individual and group life insurance to middleincome customers life premium income for this agency was 270 million  in 2016  a slight decline  from 271 million  in 2015  life premium income in 2014  totaled 272 million  net sales increased   12  during 2016  to 40 million  over the 2015  total of 36 million  net sales in 2015   increased   4  the increase in net sales during 2015  marked the first increase in several years reflecting changes in structure of the agency that management has put in place in recent years firstyear collected premium increased   6  to 29 million  during 2016  and increased   7  in 2015  to 28 million  

the liberty average producing agent count increased   12  to 1715  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared with 1535  for the same period in 2015  we continue to execute our long term plan to grow this agency through expansion from smalltown markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated lesspenetrated areas will help create long term agency growth additionally the agencys prospecting training program has helped to improve the ability of agents to develop new work site marketing business 

the other agencies  distribution channels offering life insurance include the military agency the ua independent agency which predominantly writes health insurance and various smaller distribution channels the other agencies contributed 223 million  of life premium income or 10  of torchmark’s total in 2016  but contributed only 3  of net sales for the year

life insurance underwriting income before insurance administrative expense was 574 million  in 2016  compared with 569 million  in 2015  and 556 million  in 2014  as a percentage of premium underwriting margins declined  to 26  in 2016  from 27  in 2015  the decrease in underwriting margin as a percentage of premium in 2016  and 2015  was due to higher globe life direct response net policy obligations the higher than anticipated net policy obligations in the globe life direct response unit primarily relate to policies issued in calendar years 2011 through 2015 the increase is primarily attributed to a spike in claims in certain blocks of policies as well as policies where additional prescription drug information was used in the underwriting process with an expectation of improved mortality to date improvements in actual mortality have been less than expected causing higher than expected net policy obligations

health insurance 

health insurance sold by torchmark includes primarily medicare supplement insurance critical illness coverage accident coverage and other limitedbenefit supplemental health products in this analysis all health coverage plans other than medicare supplement are classified as limitedbenefit plans 

health premium accounted for 30  of our total premium in 2016  while the health underwriting margin accounted for 26  of total underwriting margin reflective of the lower underwriting margin as a percent of premium for health compared with life insurance as noted under the caption life insurance we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health due to life’s superior profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income

the decline in medicare supplement net sales and firstyear premium was primarily due to group sales returning to a normal level after unusually high sales in late 2014 that positively affected the 2015 firstyear collected premium group sales vary significantly from period to period due to the impact of large groups that are sold from time to time which in turn impact premium income first year limitedbenefit premium increased   7  to 71 million  in 2016  compared with an increase of   11  in 2015   over  the 2014  total of 60 million  

health care reform activity is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations and we are continuing to monitor future developments the affordable care act aca imposes an annual fee to health insurance issuers offering commercial health insurance as well as another fee for premium stabilization these taxes totaled 621 thousand  12 million  and 18 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

the ua independent agency  consists of independent agencies appointed with torchmark who may also sell for other companies the ua independent agency was torchmark’s largest health agency in terms of health premium income in 2016  premium income was 355 million  representing 38  of torchmark’s total health premium net sales were 56 million  or 39  of torchmark’s health sales this agency is also torchmark’s largest producer of medicare supplement insurance with medicare supplement premium income of 342 million  the ua independent agency represents 72  of all torchmark medicare supplement premium and 91  of medicare supplement net sales medicare supplement premium in this agency rose   4  in 2016  total health premium increased   3  in 2016  and 13  in 2015  medicare supplement net sales decreased   22  in 2016  from the prior year primarily due to a decline in group sales as noted earlier group medicare supplement sales have historically fluctuated from period to period 

the family heritage exclusive agency  primarily markets limitedbenefit supplemental health insurance in nonurban areas most of their policies include a cashback feature such as a return of premium whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy management expects to grow this agency through geographic expansion and continuing incorporation of torchmark’s recruiting programs the family heritage agency contributed 51 million  in net sales in 2016  compared with 50 million  in 2015  and 47 million  in 2014  health premium income was 236 million  in 2016  representing 25  of torchmark’s health premium this compared with 221 million  or 24  of health premium in 2015  and 205 million  or 24  in 2014  the average producing agent count was 923  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared with 882  for the same period in 2015  an increase of   5  

the liberty national exclusive agency  represented 21  of all torchmark health premium income at 202 million  in 2016  the liberty agency markets limitedbenefit supplemental health products consisting primarily of critical illness insurance much of liberty’s health business is now generated through work site marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees in 2016  health premium income in the agency declined   4  from prior year premium of 209 million  after declining   6  during 2015  liberty’s health premium decline has been due primarily to its declining medicare supplement block libertys firstyear collected premium increased   8  to 16 million  in 2016 compared with an increase of   11  to 15 million  in 2015 reflecting the steady increase in net sales of limitedbenefit plans in the agency 

other distribution  certain of our other distribution channels market health products although their main emphasis is on life insurance on a combined basis they accounted for 16  of health premium in 2016  and 2015 the american income exclusive agency primarily markets accident plans the direct response group markets primarily medicare supplements to employer or unionsponsored groups direct response added 6 million  of medicare supplement net sales in 2016  compared with 5 million  in 2015  and 23 million in 2014 the higher net sales in 2014 were due to the addition of a large new group in the third quarter of 2014

annuities our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2016  2015  and 2014  were 124 billion  132 billion  and 136 billion  respectively underwriting income was 94 million  46 million  and 43 million  in each of the respective years 

while the fixed annuity account balance has been declining slightly year over year underwriting income has increased each year over the prior year the significant increase in underwriting income in 2016 was primarily due to a slowdown in amortization as assumptions were adjusted to reflect longer retention of the annuity block than previously estimated as a result of the continuing low interest rate environment policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year the majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are based on a function of account size and time lapsed since deposit a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements which can result in negative net policy obligations in the threeyear period however spreads tended to level as crediting rates reached guaranteed minimums we do not currently market annuity products favoring instead protectionoriented life and health insurance products therefore we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward

investments we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14—business segments  in the notes to the consolidated financial   statements  it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” 

we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used 68 billion  of excess cash flow at the parent company to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  



 

excess investment income increased   5 million  or 2  in 2016  over the prior year excess investment income decreased   5 million  or 2  in 2015  on a per diluted share basis excess investment income increased   6  to 183  in 2016  excess investment income increased   2  to 173  per share in 2015  after having increased   8  in the prior year the higher percentage increase in the excess investment income per diluted share amount over the percentage increase in the dollar amount of excess investment income for those same periods is a result of our share repurchase program 

presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets 



index to financial statements 

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income which rose   4  to 807 million  in 2016  it increased   2  to 774 million  in 2015  from 758 million  in 2014  in 2016  fixed maturity yields averaged 578  on a taxequivalent and effectiveyield basis compared with 584  in 2015  and 591  in 2014 growth in net investment income has been slower than the growth in mean invested assets in recent years as a result of the decline in the average yields the decrease in the overall portfolio yield from 2014 to 2016 was due primarily to reinvesting proceeds from calls and maturities at yield rates lower than the bonds earned before it was called or matured 

net investment income has also been negatively affected in the calendar years 2014 through 2016  by the cms requirement for us to pay certain medicare part d claims costs during the current period that are ultimately the responsibility of the government but are not reimbursed until the following year because of the overall design of the program and higher part d claims due to higher overall drug costs we have incurred extensive upfront costs that are not reimbursed by cms until late in the following respective year we also experience delays from the time certain claims are paid until related drug rebates are received from various pharmaceutical companies these delays in reimbursements cause a lag in the timing of investable cash flows that result in lower investment income than would have been earned absent the delays we estimate the delays resulted in a loss of approximately 5 million 8 million  and 9 million  of pretax net investment income in 2014 2015  and 2016  respectively as we have exited this business the negative impact is expected to be approximately 2 million to 3 million  in 2017  and negligible in 2018 

while net investment income in recent years has been negatively impacted by the factors discussed above we would expect to see only modest declines in the average portfolio yield rate over the next few years we anticipate that approximately 2 of fixed maturities on average are expected to run off each year over the next five years accordingly we believe it is unlikely that dispositions will have a significant negative impact on net investment income and the growth rate of net investment income in the next few years 

should interest rates rise especially longterm rates torchmarks net investment income would benefit due to higher interest rates on new purchases we could withstand an increase in interest rates of approximately 60 to 65 basis points before the net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio as of december 31 2016  would be eliminated assuming there were no credit related valuation declines should interest rates increase further than that we would not be concerned with potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio because we have the intent and more importantly the ability to hold our fixed maturities to maturity 

  

required interest on net insurance policy liabilities r educes net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to “fund” the required interest included in the insurance segments as such it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments as discussed in note 14business segments   in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements  management believes this provides a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force the great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interestrate protection policies not investment products and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for longduration insurance products which mandates that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business each calendar year we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year and cannot be changed the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in as such the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years changes in the overall weightedaverage discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weightedaverage discount rate due to the size of our in force business 

because actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weightedaverage discount rate of our in force block we don’t expect an extended lowinterestrate environment to cause a loss recognition event

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations 

  

analysis of financing costs 

amounts in thousands 

  

  

financing costs increased   7 million  or 9  from 2015  to 2016  the additional interest expense on our funded debt resulted from the issuance of our new 6125 junior subordinated debt security seventy days before the maturity and repayment of our 6375 senior notes in 2016  interest on shortterm debt increased because of the increase in the weightedaverage interest rate financing costs also increased  slightly from 2014  to 2015  more information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the financial   condition  section of this report and in note 11—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

as previously noted growth rates in our excess investment income decline when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs as has been the case in recent years in an extended lowinterestrate environment the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower longterm rates 

  

excess investment income benefits from increases in longterm rates available on new investments and decreases in shortterm borrowing rates of these two factors higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount 

index to financial statements 

of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at shortterm rates therefore torchmark would benefit if rates especially longterm rates were to rise 

investment acquisitions  torchmark’s investment policy calls for investing in fixed maturities that are investment grade and meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities we believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable if longerterm securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available we do not relax our quality objectives but instead consider investing in shorter term or lower yielding securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors 

during calendar years 2014  through 2016  torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities primarily in corporate bonds with longerterm maturities the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases for the last three years the effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield commonly referred to as the “worst call date” for noncallable bonds the worstcall date is always the maturity date for callable bonds the worstcall date is the call date that produces the lowest yield typically the first call date

 we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment however absent sales the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 

  

during the three years 2014  through 2016  acquisitions consisted of securities spanning a diversified range of issuers industry sectors and geographical regions all of the acquired securities were investment grade in addition to the fixed maturity acquisitions torchmark invested 30 million in a limited partnership in 2015 with an additional investment in the partnership of 19 million in 2016 the limited partnership is a diversified investment fund that currently invests opportunistically in global credit assets with the potential for attractive returns relative to risk it is classified within longterm investments 

new cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations and interest received on existing investments in some years a significant amount of new investments can be derived from proceeds from dispositions including issuer calls issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past three years were an important factor calls increase funds available for investment but as noted earlier in this discussion they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in

our investment policy regarding fixed maturities is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings we have no direct investments in commercial or residential mortgages and we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts we do not participate in securities lending we have no offbalance sheet investments and we have only an insignificant exposure to european sovereign debt   consisting of 2 million in german government bonds at december 31 2016  our exposure to puerto rican obligations is insignificant on june 23 2016 the united kingdom voted to depart the european union eu under the referendum commonly referred to as brexit although the formal separation from the eu will take time the nature and extent of the effects on interest rates and economic performance are uncertain at this time we do not expect an increase in otherthantemporary impairments on our limited exposure related to this event 

market risk sensitivity torchmark’s investment securities are exposed to interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since 96  of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixedrate investments the portfolio is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio rising and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline under normal market conditions we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and the intent to hold these investments to maturity the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however as is permitted by gaap these liabilities are not recorded at fair value

realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses generally occur only incidentally usually as the result of bonds sold because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by write downs due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause periodtoperiod trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

insurance subsidiary liquidity the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes the funds to provide for policy benefits the majority of which are paid in future periods are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities to meet these longterm obligations in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restriction the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains while the leading source of the excess cash is investment income due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income 

  

parent company liquidity cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt operating expenses of the parent and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders in 2016  the parent received 438 million  of cash dividends from its subsidiaries compared with 466 million  in 2015  and 479 million  in 2014  including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations shareholder dividends and other expenses but before share repurchases the parent company had excess cash flow in 2016  of approximately 311 million compared with 358 million in 2015  and 377 million in 2014  parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes such as insurance subsidiary capital or financing needs strategic acquisitions or share repurchases in 2017  it is expected that the parent company will receive approximately 450 million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries and that approximately 325 to 335 million will be available as excess cash flow certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions  section of note 12—shareholders’ equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company 

index to financial statements 

shortterm borrowings an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 750 million which could be extended up to 1 billion while torchmark can request the extension it is not guaranteed in may 2016 torchmark amended the facility to extend the maturity date to may 2021 the amendment also allowed for an additional 100 million term loan as discussed under the caption credit facility  in note 11—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the facility is further designated as a backup line of credit for a commercial paper program as well as the standby letters of credit as discussed below as of december 31 2016  we had available 310 million  of additional borrowing capacity under this facility compared with 332 million  a year earlier there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended december 31 2016  

  

in summary torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2017  and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of additional debt additional borrowings on our shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing 

  

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from continuing operations were 12 billion  in 2016  compared with 11 billion  in 2015  and 10 billion  in 2014  in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies received proceeds from maturities calls and repayments of fixed maturities in the amount of 236 million  in 2016  compared with 376 million  in 2015  and 273 million  in 2014  

  

our cash and shortterm investments were 148 million  at yearend 2016  and 116 million  at yearend 2015  additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 152 billion  at december 31 2016  however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as a part of its aforementioned credit facility torchmark had outstanding 177 million  in standby letters of credit at december 31 2016  and 2015  these letters are issued among our subsidiaries one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer and have no impact on company obligations as a whole any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of offshore captive reinsurers might require torchmark to obtain thirdparty financing which could cause an immaterial increase in financing costs 

  

as of december 31 2016  we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities all of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 15—commitments and contingencies   in the notes to consolidated financial statements

capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in   note 11—debt   in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the current maturity of funded debt   longterm funded debt and shareholders’ equity a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 11  

  

debt  the carrying value of the funded debt was 11 billion  at december 31 2016 compared with 993 million  a year earlier on april 5 2016 torchmark completed the issuance and sale of 300 million  aggregate principal amount of torchmark’s 6125  junior subordinated debentures due 2056 the debentures were sold pursuant to torchmark’s shelf registration statement on form s3 filed september 25 2015 the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures were 290 million  after giving effect to the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering of the debentures torchmark used the net proceeds from the offering of the debentures to repay the 250 million  outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest of 8 million  on its 6375  senior notes that were due june 15 2016 the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 

  

subsidiary capital our insurance subsidiaries target a capital ratio of approximately 325 of company action level regulatory capital under riskbased capital rbc a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital the 325 target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows the relatively low risk of their product mix and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark at december 31 2016  our insurance subsidiaries had an aggregate rbc ratio of approximately 324 should we experience impairments andor ratings downgrades within our fixed maturity portfolio in the future the ratio could fall below targeted levels in such a case management believes more than sufficient liquidity exists at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the targeted ratio

shareholders equity  as noted under the caption summary of operations  in this report we have an ongoing share repurchase program under this program we acquired 5 million  shares at a cost of 311 million  in 2016  6 million  shares at a cost of 359 million  in 2015  and 7 million  shares for 375 million  in 2014  the majority of purchased shares are retired each year please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption summary of operations  in this report 

  

torchmark has continually increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years in the first quarter of 2014  it was increased to 01267  per share from 01133 per share in the first quarter of 2015  it was raised to 0135  per share finally in the first quarter of 2016  dividends were raised to 014  per share 

  

shareholders’ equity was 46 billion  at december 31 2016  compared with 41 billion  at december 31 2015  during the twelve months since december 31 2015  shareholders’ equity was reduced by the 311 million  in share purchases under the repurchase program and 93 million  to offset the dilution from stock option exercises however it was increased by 550 million  of net income and 357 million  of aftertax unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio 

  

we plan to use excess cash available at the parent company as efficiently as possible in the future possible uses of excess cash flow include but are not limited to share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in securities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that targeted capital levels are maintained in our companies 

we maintain a significant availableforsale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets while invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets from time to time the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity because of the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

index to financial statements 

the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  



 

fasb guidance provides for an option which if elected would permit us to value our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets  however unlike the accounting rule which permits us to account for changes in our availableforsale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income the guidance requires such changes to be recorded in earnings because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results therefore we have not elected this option 

  

torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 103  times in 2016  compared with 110  times in 2015  and 113  times in 2014  based on continuing operations this timesinterestearned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pretax income from continuing operations and interest expense a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments  in this report

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries such punitive damage claims may have the potential for significant adverse results since torchmark and its subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 15—commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits    due to the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies   in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

approximately 86  of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2016  were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  under the caption future policy benefits  otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended december 31 2016  

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs  certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note   1 — significant accounting policies  under the caption deferred acquisition costs  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  additionally the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies known as the value of insurance purchased is included in deferred acquisition costs our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1 

  

approximately 99 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2016  were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2016  

  

the remaining 1 of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31 2016  

  

policy claims and other benefits payable  this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

index to financial statements 

  

valuation of fixed maturities  we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to manage risk we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk   sensitivity  in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition  in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

at times the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in note 1—significant accounting policies  and in note 4—investments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the captions fair value measurements  in both notes 

  

impairment of investments  we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value and that have become impaired in value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an otherthantemporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments  and realized gains and   losses  in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans  we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2016  our gross liability under these plans was 528 million  but was offset by assets of 329 million  

index to financial statements 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans for example a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2016  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2016  

  



  

 

the company determines mortality assumptions through the use of published mortality tables that reflect broadbased studies of mortality and published longevity improvement scales during 2014 the company revised the mortality assumptions based on an evaluation of a new mortality table and longevity scale released by the society of actuaries the change in these assumptions added approximately 26 million to the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014 

  

the criteria used to determine the primary assumptions are discussed in note 9—postretirement benefits   in the notes to consolidated financial statements  while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to us note 9  also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies and other related data

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management at torchmark corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis as a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting the company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls accordingly even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time 

  

management evaluated the company’s internal control over financial reporting and based on its assessment determined that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2016  the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in note 1—significant accounting policies in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements  reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

  

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities fixed maturities represented 96  of total investments at fair value at december 31 2015   see   note 4—investments   in the  notes to consolidated financial statements  and management’s discussion and analysis   

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is based on its proportional share of the premium in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in indiana nebraska ohio and new york

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a regulated industry populated by many firms we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits as our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market the development maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and globe life direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical adequate compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical in globe life direct response continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits 

  

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  we serve primarily the middleincome market for individual protection life and health insurance and as a result we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of a significant sustained economic downturn or otherwise then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether economic conditions could also impact our investment portfolio as discussed under investment risks  below 

  

variations in expected to actual rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test expectedtoactual results actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set accordingly we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could require policy obligations to be increased and negatively affect our profit margins and income 

  

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways including the following limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies 

  

rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could potentially have a negative effect on our operations by limiting our access to capital markets increasing the cost of debt impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

ratings reflect only the rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control in addition rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated 

index to financial statements 

company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered the models changes to the models could impact the rating agencies’ judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

reputational risk 

  

damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business  negative publicity through traditional media internet social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts the ability to market our products and the persistency of our block of inforce policies 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

  

our life products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish  we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches labor union members and sales via globe life direct response solicitation deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to unsolicited globe life direct response marketing could negatively affect this business 

  

health insurance marketplace risks 

  

the health insurance market is subject to substantial legislative scrutiny  legislative changes could impact our medicare supplement and other supplemental health businesses the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business 

  

competition in the health market can be significant  sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors in addition some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or under price new sales in order to gain market share we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms accordingly changes in the competitive landscape including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products 

  

an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability 

investment risks 

  

our investments are subject to market and credit risks our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixedmaturity and shortterm investments a significant portion of our fixedmaturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels financial market performance disruptions in credit markets general economic conditions legislative changes particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control additionally because the majority of our investments are longerterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity significant increases in interest rates widening of credit spreads or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant 

index to financial statements 

unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable in that case the unrealized loss will be realized at which point we would take an impairment charge reducing our net income 

  

difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses a default by an issuer could result in a significant otherthantemporary impairment of that investment causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income the risk of default is higher for bonds with longerterm maturities which we acquire in order to match our longterm insurance obligations we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all significant downgrades of issuers could negatively impact our riskbased capital ratios leading to potential downgrades by our rating agencies potential reduction in future dividend capacity andor higher financing costs at the holding company should additional statutory capital be required material otherthantemporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus leading to lower riskbased capital ratios potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries while we intend to hold our investments until maturity a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments resulting in substantial realized losses from the write downs of impaired investments current net income would be negatively impacted by the write downs and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income 

  

declines in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

  

liquidity risks 

  

our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available primarily dividends from our insurance subsidiaries as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity also include a variety of shortterm and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper longterm debt intercompany financing and reinsurance 

the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income excluding capital gains on an annual noncumulative basis or 10 of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval accordingly impairments in invested assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us a principal source of our cash flow 

  

we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries although we do not anticipate changes changes in these laws could constrain 

index to financial statements 

the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses additionally the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock 

  

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital should credit spreads widen in the future the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility therefore as a result our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders not our investors state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising licensing agents policy forms capital adequacy solvency reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business should these changes to our business occur we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations which may change from time to time if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines 

  

we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives in recent years there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries by insurance regulatory authorities which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our agents or employees are improper these actions can result in substantial fines penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may even absent any particular regulatory authority’s interpretation of an issue changing cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to our practices that may in some cases limit our ability to grow impact regulatory capital requirements or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business 

  

currently the us federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance however the doddfrank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 has established a federal insurance office fio within the 

index to financial statements 

department of the treasury and the affordable care act and a financial stability oversight council fsoc created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight cciio originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct oversight or regulation of the insurance industry we cannot predict what impact if any the fio fsoc and cciio as well as any other proposals for federal oversight or regulation of insurance could have on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry including the products it offers could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income or negatively affect our ability to sell some of our products 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may affect our financial statements reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability 

  

if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries we are and in the future may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants and in certain of these matters the plaintiffs are seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis however the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states in which we operate juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit 

  

our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases the costs of settlement or judgments against us or changes in our operations that could result from litigation substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation which in turn could materially harm our business and our business prospects 

  

index to financial statements 

catastrophic event risk 

  

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a pandemic hurricane earthquake or manmade catastrophes including acts of terrorism or war which may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 

  

information security and technology risk 

  

a security breach the introduction of malware in our computing environment employee error or malfeasance unauthorized access a natural or manmade disaster or other unanticipated event could compromise the information security systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

a failure in our information security systems could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information damage to our reputation loss of cash flow and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively in some cases we may not become aware of such incident for some time after it occurs which could increase our exposure 

anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could access view misappropriate alter or delete confidential information in the systems including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information in addition an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access use or disclosure of their information any such breach of confidential information could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter people from purchasing our products result in the loss of existing customers subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical legal and other expenses 

in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an industrial accident a blackout or a terrorist attack or war our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time  even if our employees are able to report to work they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and if existing contingency plans cannot function as designed

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements  and notes  thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully explained in note 14—business segments  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements  the insurance product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and the administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is 

  

net investment income 

less 

required interest on net policy liabilities 

financing costs 

  

the tables in note 14—business segments  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2015  additionally this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates yeartoyear comparability and which reconciles to net income that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated   financial statements  to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations net income was 527 million  in 2015  compared with 543 million  in 2014  net income increased in 2014  from 528 million  in 2013  on a diluted per share basis 2015  net income rose 2  to 416  after an 8  increase in 2014  net income per diluted share in 2014  rose to 409  from 379  in 2013  the pershare results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program also each year’s per share net income was affected by realized investment gains which were 005  012  and 003  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively more information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses  in this report where there is a more complete discussion also as explained in note 14—business segments  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments additionally we do not consider nonoperating items which are not related to the current ongoing reporting performance of our segments to be part of our segment operating income 

management has committed to a plan to sell the medicare part d business in 2016 torchmark no longer emphasizes its medicare part d business due to declining margins increased risks higher drug costs and increased administrative and compliance costs management believes this sale will allow the company to better focus on its core protection life and health insurance businesses as well as provide additional capital to invest the medicare part d business met the criteria for discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting guidance and as such the business is reflected as discontinued operations in the financial statements as this business has been classified as held for sale and its operations are discontinued the financial results of this business are excluded from torchmarks continuing operations for more information refer to note 6—discontinued operations  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

as shown in the above chart aftertax segment results of continuing operations rose each year over the prior year from 509 million  in 2013  to 520 million  in 2014  to 523 million  in 2015  the primary contributor to the growth in both 2015  and 2014  was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment in which margins rose 13 million  in 2015  and 11 million  in 2014  the life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings

in each year presented also contributing to growth in income in both years was our health insurance segment which provided 5 million  of additional margin in 2015  and 3 million  in 2014  

  

excess investment income the measure of profitability of our investment segment decreased to 220 million  or 2  from the prior year amount of 224 million  in 2014  excess investment income increased 3 although interest rates increased slightly in 2015  the low interest rate environment continued to pressure investment yields and spreads related to required interest on net policy liabilities throughout the threeyear period excess investment income has also been hampered by a lag in government reimbursements of medicare part d costs the impact of the lost investment income from delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting rules as noted previously the medicare part d business has been classified as discontinued operations in 2015  and 2014 the timing of cash flows in the medicare part d business had a negative impact on excess investment income pretax of approximately 8 million and 5 million respectively 

  

total revenues rose 4  in 2015  to 38 billion  or 146 million  over the prior year total of 36 billion  life premium rose 5  or 107 million  in 2015  to 21 billion  life premium increased 81 million in 2014  to 20 billion  net investment income rose 24 million or 3 in 2014  and rose 2  or 16 million  in 2015  health premium increased 6  to 926 million  in 2015  and contributed 56 million to 2015  revenue growth after having gained 1 to 869 million  in 2014  health premium contributed 6 million to 2014  revenue growth 

  

life insurance premium and underwriting margins have grown steadily in each of the three years ended december 31 2015 the increase in life premium was driven by sales growth and improvements in persistency while premium and underwriting margins grew margin as a percent of premium fell slightly in 2015  to 27  after decreasing from 29  to 28  from 2013  to 2014  these fluctuations were due primarily to higher than expected claims net life sales increased 9  in 2015  to 412 million  after increasing 12  in 2014  the life insurance segment is discussed further in this report under the caption life insurance  

  

with regard to health insurance we primarily market medicare supplement insurance and limitedbenefit products including critical illness and accident products in 2013 and 2014 the limitedbenefit health premiums have exceeded the medicare supplement premiums due to the inclusion of family heritage at the end of 2012 in late 2014 we experienced an unusually large volume of group sales of our medicare supplement product as a result of increased growth in group sales the medicare supplement premiums increased 43 million  which exceeded the limitbenefit premiums health insurance premium income increased 6  to 926 million  in 2015 health net sales fell 13  to 156 million  during 2015  as a result of a 29  decrease in medicare supplement sales firstyear collected health premium rose 32  to 157 million  from the prior year total of 119 million  the decrease in 2015 health net sales and increase in 2015 firstyear collected premium was reflective of the previously mentioned large volume of group sales in 2014  health margins declined to 22  with underwriting income increasing to 204 million  for 2015  margins were 199 million  for the same period in 2014  the 2015 change was due to lower pricing margins on the group business sold in 2014 

  

we do not currently market annuities see the caption annuities  for discussion of the annuity segment 

  

the investment segment’s pretax profitability or excess investment income is based on three major components net investment income required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to insurance products and financing costs in 2015  net investment income rose 2  compared with 3 in 2014  at the same time our investment portfolio grew 3 in both 2015  and 2014  in recent years net investment income has not grown as fast as the portfolio due to new investments being made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of also there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested during which the funds are held in cash growth in total investment income is also somewhat negatively affected by torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments in 2015  and 2014  net investment income was negatively impacted by our medicare part d business under the program we are required to cover certain claim costs in the current period that are the federal government’s responsibility but are not reimbursed until late in the next calendar year this delay in reimbursement reduced our funds available for investment in 2015  and 2014  resulting in reduced investment income in both periods 

  

the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets the lower newmoney yields resulting from the 

index to financial statements 

lowinterestrate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow at approximately the same rate that net policy liabilities have grown financing costs which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and shortterm debt are also deducted from net investment income financing costs in 2015  were up slightly to 77 million from 76 million in 2014  this increase was primarily the result of increased short term borrowings coupled with slightly higher short term interest rates the 2014 decline resulted from the maturity and repayment in 2013 of our 945 million principal amount 7375 notes 

  

torchmark’s current investment policy regarding fixed maturities limits new fixed maturity acquisitions to investmentgrade securities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives approximately 96 of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which 96  were investment grade at december 31 2015  the average quality rating of the portfolio was a the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alta mortgages no direct investment in residential mortgages no credit default swaps or other derivative contracts see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments  in this report and note 4—investments  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of this segment 

insurance administrative expenses were up 65  in 2015  when compared with the prior year period the primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology and employee costs including pensionrelated costs stock compensation expense declined 4 million  in 2015  to 287 million  compared with an increase of 7 million  in 2014  to 322 million  the decline in stock compensation expense in 2015  resulted primarily from lower expense associated with performance shares as well as lower option values on 2015  option awards 

in each of the years 2013  through 2015  net income was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring nonoperating items we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations accordingly as described in note 14—business segments  in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements  we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are nonoperating items when evaluating the results of current operations and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods 

  

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises the board of directors has authorized the company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management in consultation with the board determines to be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the last three years

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows the following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations as described in note 14—business segments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  

life insurance life insurance is our largest insurance segment with 2015  life premium representing 69  of total premium life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 73  of the total in 2015  additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

life insurance premium rose 5  to 21 billion  in 2015  after having increased 4  in 2014  to 20 billion  life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue net sales is annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of globe life direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

  

annualized life premium in force was 215 billion at december 31 2015  an increase of 5 over 204 billion a year earlier annualized life premium in force was 196 billion at december 31 2013

the american income exclusive agency  has historically marketed primarily to members of labor unions while labor unions are still the core market for this agency american income has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help ensure sustainable growth the life business of this agency is torchmark’s highestmargin life business and it is the largest contributor to life premium of any distribution channel at 40  of torchmark’s 2015  total this group produced premium income of 831 million  an increase of 8  over the prior year total of 766 million  after having risen 7 in 2014  firstyear collected premium was 156 million  compared to 134 million  in 2014  an increase of 16  firstyear collected premium rose 5 in 2014  net sales increased 15  to 198 million  in 2015  over the 2014  total of 172 million  net sales increased 13 in 2014  over the 2013  total of 153 million  sales growth in our captive agencies is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force the american income agencys average agent count rose 11  to 6529  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared with 5868  for the same period in 2014  the average agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the period the american income agency has been focusing on growing and strengthening middle management to support sustainable growth of the agency force to accomplish this we have placed an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train personnel the agency continues to provide more homeoffice and webinar training programs these programs are designed to provide each agent from new recruits to top level managers coaching and instruction specifically designed for each individual’s level of experience and responsibility 

the globe life direct response  unit offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of directtoconsumer marketing approaches which include direct mailings insert media and electronic media these different approaches support and complement one another in the unit’s efforts to reach the consumer the globe life direct response channel’s growth has been fueled by constant innovation in recent years electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology and 

index to financial statements 

has focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center we continually introduce new initiatives in this unit in an attempt to increase response rates 

while the juvenile market is an important source of sales it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders who are more likely to respond favorably to a globe life direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 

globe life direct response’s life premium income rose 6 to 747 million  representing 36 of torchmark’s total life premium during 2015  life premium in this channel increased 6 in 2014  to 702 million  over the 2013  total of 664 million  net sales of 164 million  for this group increased 4 from 158 million  in 2014  after a 10 in 2014  firstyear collected premium increased 6 to 106 million  in 2015  after having risen 8 in 2014  

the liberty national exclusive agency  markets individual and group life insurance to middleincome customers life premium income for this agency was 271 million  in 2015  a slight decline from 272 million  in 2014  life premium income in 2013  totaled 276 million  net sales increased 4 during 2015  to 36 million  over the 2014  total of 34 million  net sales in 2014  increased 11 the increase in net sales during 2014  marked the first increase in several years reflecting changes in structure of the agency that management has put in place in recent years firstyear collected premium increased 7 to 28 million  during 2015  and was flat in 2014  compared to 2013  at 26 million  

the liberty average agent count increased 2  to 1535  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared with 1505  for the same period in 2014  we continue to execute our long term plan to grow this agency through expansion from smalltown markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated lesspenetrated areas will help create long term agency growth additionally our prospecting training program has helped to improve the ability of agents to develop new work site marketing business 

the other agencies  distribution channels offering life insurance include the military agency the ua independent agency which predominantly writes health insurance and various smaller distribution channels the other agencies contributed 224 million  of life premium income or 11 of torchmark’s total in 2015  but contributed only 3 of net sales for the year

life insurance underwriting income before insurance administrative expense was 569 million  in 2015  compared with 556 million  in 2014  and 545 million  in 2013  as a percentage of premium underwriting margins declined to 27  in 2015  from 28  in 2014  the decrease in underwriting margin as a percentage of premium in 2015  and 2014 was due primarily to higher than expected globe life direct response policy obligations and to increases in nondeferred acquisition costs in the globe life direct response and american income units nondeferred acquisition expense 

index to financial statements 

increased primarily as a result of additional investments made to support our distribution channels which are expected to result in increased sales and premium income in future periods the higher than expected claims in the globe life direct response unit primarily relate to policies issued since 2011 where prescription information was used in the underwriting process for certain policies in order to improve the overall mortality of the policies written to date improvements in the actual mortality on such policies have been less than expected causing an increase in our net policy obligations 

health insurance health insurance sold by torchmark includes primarily medicare supplement insurance critical illness coverage accident coverage and other limitedbenefit supplemental health products in this analysis all health coverage plans other than medicare supplement are classified as limitedbenefit plans 

health premium accounted for 31  of our total premium in 2015  while the health underwriting margin accounted for 26  of total underwriting margin reflective of the lower underwriting margin as a percent of premium for health compared with life insurance as noted under the caption life insurance we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health due to life’s superior profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income

we do not expect recent health care reform activity to have a significant impact on our operations the affordable care act aca imposes an annual fee to health insurance issuers offering commercial health insurance as well as another fee for premium stabilization these taxes totaled 12 million and 18 million in 2015  and 2014  respectively 

the ua independent agency  consists of independent agencies appointed with torchmark who may also sell for other companies the ua independent agency was torchmark’s largest health agency in terms of health premium income in 2015 premium income was 345 million  representing 37  of torchmark’s total health premium net sales were 72 million  or 46  of torchmark’s health sales this agency is torchmark’s largest producer of medicare supplement insurance with medicare supplement premium income of 330 million  the ua independent agency represents approximately 71 of all torchmark medicare supplement premium and 93 of medicare supplement net sales medicare supplement premium in this agency rose 15 total health premium increased 13 in 2015  and 2 in 2014  medicare supplement net sales decreased 15 in 2015  from prior year individual sales were up 36 due to the high volume of sales in late 2014 and 2015 as previously discussed group sales significantly increased in late 2014 resulting in a 42 decline in the current year which is consistent with historical fluctuation from period to period 

the family heritage exclusive agency  primarily markets limitedbenefit supplemental health insurance in nonurban areas most of their policies include a cashback feature such as a return of premium whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy management expects to grow this agency through geographic expansion and continuing incorporation of torchmark’s recruiting programs the family heritage agency contributed 50 million  in net sales in 2015  compared with 47 million  in 2014  and 44 million  in 2013  health premium income was 221 million  in 2015  representing 24  of torchmark’s health premium this compared with 205 million or 24 of health premium in 2014  and 191 million or 22 in 2013  the average agent count was 882 for the year ended december 31 2015  compared with 740 for the same period in 2014  an increase of 19 

the liberty national exclusive agency  represented 23 of all torchmark health premium income at 209 million in 2015  the liberty agency markets limitedbenefit supplemental health products consisting primarily of critical illness insurance much of liberty’s health business is now generated through work site marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees in 2015  health premium income in the agency declined 6 from prior year premium of 222 million after declining 8 during 2014 liberty’s health premium decline has been due primarily to its declining medicare supplement block 

other distribution  certain of our other distribution channels market health products although their main emphasis is on life insurance on a combined basis they accounted for 16 of health premium in 2015  the american income exclusive agency primarily markets accident plans the direct response group markets primarily medicare supplements to employer or unionsponsored groups direct response added 5 million of medicare supplement net sales in 2015  compared with 23 million in 2014  the higher net sales in 2014  were due to the addition of a large new group in the third quarter of 2014  

as presented in the following table torchmark’s health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense increased 3 to 204 million in 2015  after an increase of 1 to 199 million in 2014 as a percentage of health premium margins were down slightly to 22 in 2015 due to increased benefit ratios in the direct response and ua channels the group business sold in 2014 was priced at higher benefit ratios

annuities our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2015  2014  and 2013  were 132 billion 136 billion and 138 billion respectively underwriting income was 46 million  43 million  and 39 million in each of the respective years 

  

while the fixed annuity account balance has been declining slightly year over year underwriting income has increased each year over the prior year policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year the majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are based on a function of account size and time lapsed since deposit a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements which can result in negative net policy obligations in the threeyear period however spreads tended to level as crediting rates reached guaranteed minimums 

  

we do not currently market annuity products favoring instead protectionoriented life and health insurance products therefore we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward

insurance administrative expenses were up 65  in 2015  when compared with the prior year after declining slightly during 2014  as a percentage of total premium insurance administrative expenses were flat during 2015  when compared to 2014  at 62  and down when compared to 2013  which stood at 64  total operating expenses increased 29  consistent with the 2014  increase over 2013  the primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology and employee costs including pensionrelated costs the decline in stock compensation expense is primarily due to lower expense associated with performance share awards and lower option values on the 2015 grants the decline in legal settlement expense was attributable to certain legal and administrative settlements that occurred in 2014  as described in note 14—business segments  in the notes on the consolidated financial statements  we recorded legal accruals involving noninsurance matters partially offset by proceeds for investment litigation litigation not related to our direct insurance operations is not considered an insurance administrative expense by torchmark management and is removed from its analysis of core insurance operations in its segment reporting

investments we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14—business segments  in the notes to the consolidated financial   statements  it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” 

we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used over 65 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment

excess investment income decreased 5 million or 2 in 2015  over the prior year excess investment income increased 6 million or 3 in 2014  excess investment income has been pressured over the past three years as a result of the impact of lower interest rates on net investment income coupled with the increase in required interest on net policy liabilities discussed later under this caption on a per diluted share basis excess investment income increased 2 to 173 in 2015  excess investment income increased 8 to 169 per share in 2014  after having declined 3 in the prior year the significant increase in the 2014 per share amount over 2013 and the increase in the 2015 per share amount over 2014 versus the decrease in dollar amount of excess investment income is a result of the share repurchase program 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income which rose 2 to 774 million in 2015  it increased 3 to 758 million in 2014  from 735 million in 2013  growth in net investment income has generally been slower than growth in mean invested assets in recent years due to the declining interest rate environment in 2015  fixed maturity yields averaged 584 on a taxequivalent and effectiveyield basis compared with 591 in 2014  and 594 in 2013  even though mean invested assets have increased each period net investment income has grown at a slower pace as a result of the decline in average yields the overall average portfolio yield decreased in the 2013 

index to financial statements 

to 2015 periods as new money is being invested at lower prevailing yields and from the result of reinvesting proceeds from bonds that matured or were called at yield rates less than the rates we earned on the bonds before they matured or were called a significant amount of calls were a negative factor on net investment income in 2013 but calls and maturities were very limited in their affect in 2014 and 2015 during 2014 and 2015 the proceeds from all dispositions have been reinvested at yield rates closer to the yield rates on the disposed assets 

  

net investment income has also been negatively affected in 2014 and 2015  by the cms requirement for us to pay certain medicare part d claims costs during the current period that are ultimately the responsibility of the government but are not reimbursed until the following year because of the overall design of the program and higher part d claims due to the approval of new hepatitis c drugs and higher overall drug costs we have incurred extensive upfront costs that are not reimbursed by cms until late in the following respective year these delays in reimbursements have caused a delay in cash flows available for new investments that resulted in a loss of approximately 5 million and 8 million of pretax net investment income in 2014 and 2015  respectively and will cause us to lose approximately 9 million of additional investment income in 2016 

  

presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income and the growth in mean invested assets 

  



  

while net investment income in recent years has been negatively impacted by the factors discussed above we would expect to see only modest declines in the average portfolio yield rate over the next few years we anticipate that less than 2 of fixed maturities on average are expected to run off each year over the next five years and the average yield rate on assets acquired with the proceeds of dispositions is not expected to be significantly less than the yield rate earned on the assets prior to their disposal accordingly we believe it is unlikely that dispositions will have a significant negative impact on net investment income and the growth rate of net investment income in the next few years 

required interest on net insurance policy liabilities r educes net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to “fund” the required interest included in the insurance segments as such it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments as discussed in note 14business segments   in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements  management believes this provides a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force the great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interestrate protection policies not investment products and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for longduration insurance products which mandates that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be “locked in” for the life of that block of business each calendar year we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year and cannot be changed the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in as such the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years changes in the overall weightedaverage discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weightedaverage discount rate due to the size of our in force business 

because actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weightedaverage discount rate of our in force block we don’t expect an extended lowinterestrate environment to cause a loss recognition event

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations

financing costs increased slightly from 2014 to 2015 the decrease of 4 million or 5 in 2014  was related to the maturity and repayment of our 94 million par amount 7375 notes during the third quarter of 2013 in 2015  interest on shortterm debt increased primarily because of the increase in the weightedaverage interest rate and the average balance on shortterm debt more information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the financial   condition  section of this report and in note 11—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

as previously noted growth rates in our excess investment income decline when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs as has been the case in recent years in an extended lowinterestrate environment the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower longterm rates we believe however the decline would be relatively slow as on average less than 2 of fixed maturities are expected to run off each year over the next five years

in response to the lower interest rates we raised the premium rates for new business on major life products in early 2012 and again in late 2013 the increased premium provides additional margin on these policies to help offset higher mandatory cash values and the possible future reductions in excess investment income despite these increases in premium rates we have continued to see growth in net sales 

  

excess investment income benefits from increases in longterm rates available on new investments and decreases in shortterm borrowing rates of these two factors higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at shortterm rates therefore torchmark would benefit if rates especially longterm rates were to rise 

investment acquisitions  torchmark’s investment policy calls for investing in fixed maturities that are investment grade and meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities we believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable if longerterm securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available we do not relax our quality objectives but instead consider investing in shorter term or lower yielding securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors 

during calendar years 2013  through 2015  torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities primarily in corporate bonds with longerterm maturities the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases for the last three years the effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield commonly referred to as the “worst call date” for noncallable bonds the worstcall date is always the maturity date for callable bonds the worstcall date is the call date that produces the lowest yield typically the first call date

we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment however absent sales the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 

  

during the three years 2013  through 2015  acquisitions consisted of securities spanning a diversified range of issuers industry sectors and geographical regions all of the acquired securities were investment grade in addition to the fixed maturity acquisitions torchmark invested 30 million in a limited partnership in 2015  the limited partnership is a diversified investment fund that currently invests opportunistically in global credit assets with the potential for attractive returns relative to risk it is classified within longterm investments

new cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations and coupons received on existing investments in some years a significant amount of new investments can be derived from proceeds from dispositions including issuer calls issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past three years were an important factor especially in 2013  calls increase funds available for investment but as noted earlier in this discussion they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than those of the bonds that were called issuer calls were 178 million in 2015  160 million in 2014  and 344 million in 2013  the higher level of acquisitions in 2013  was primarily due to the additional funds available from the higher level of 2013  calls the lower level of acquisitions in 2014 was primarily due to the delay in receiving cms reimbursements as discussed earlier

at december 31 2015  fixed maturities had a fair value of 138 billion  compared with 145 billion  at december 31 2014  the net unrealized gain position in the fixed maturity portfolio decreased from 17 billion  at december 31 2014  to 506 million  at december 31 2015  primarily as a result of an increase in market interest rates the december 31 2015  net unrealized gain consisted of gross unrealized gains of 11 billion  offset by 564 million  of gross unrealized losses compared with the december 31 2014  net unrealized gain which consisted of a gross unrealized gain of 17 billion  and a gross unrealized loss of 79 million  as described in note 4—investments   in the  notes to the consolidated financial statements the increase in gross unrealized losses was partially attributable to rising interest rates in the financial markets but also resulted from deteriorating conditions in the energy and metals and mining sectors 

corporate securities are diversified over a variety of industry sectors and issuersthe total fixed maturity portfolio consists of 563 issuers with 205 issuers within the financial utility and energy sectors 

financial and utilities at december 31 2015  the fixed maturity securities in the financial and utility sectors had net unrealized gains of 288 million and 196 million respectively less than 6 of the book value of the holdings in each of these sectors was rated belowinvestment grade while the fair market value of the securities in these two sectors declined during the year torchmark does not believe that its fixed maturity securities in the financial and utility sectors pose a significant credit risk in the foreseeable future or that any of these securities are otherthantemporarily impaired 

energy and basic materials  the current low price of oil and other commodities is putting some downward price pressure on some of our holdings in the energy and basic materials sectors resulting in lower fair values of these sectors as noted above our energy sector investments accounted for 12 of fixed maturities at amortized cost and 10 of fixed maturities at fair value as of december 31 2015  at amortized cost over 93 of the energy holdings are investment grade within our energy portfolio 53 of the holdings at amortized cost are in pipelines 34 are in exploration and production 6 are in oil field services and the remainder are in refineries and drilling we believe securities in drilling and oil field services with an amortized cost of 44 million rated below investment grade have the greatest risk of exposure to the current market conditions our investments in basic materials accounted for 8 of fixed maturities at amortized cost and 7 of fixed maturities at fair value as of december 31 2015  at amortized cost over 95 of these holdings are investment grade within this sector 49 of the holdings at amortized cost are in chemicals 40 are in mining and the remainder are in forestry products 

while a sustained period of low oil and natural gas prices and depressed demand for commodities may lead to some downgrades in these sectors we believe that our investments will be able to withstand lower energy and commodity prices for an extended duration due to the strong and stable cash flows generated by our insurance products torchmark has the ability to hold securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery even though these fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale torchmark generally intends to hold to maturity any securities which are temporarily impaired as of december 31 2015  torchmark does not believe that any of its holdings in the energy and basic materials sectors are otherthantemporarily impaired

our investment policy regarding fixed maturities is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by subprime or alta mortgages loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower we have no direct investments in residential mortgages and we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts we do not participate in securities lending we have no offbalance sheet investments and we have only an insignificant exposure to european sovereign debt   consisting of 2 million in german government bonds at december 31 2015  our exposure to puerto rican obligations is insignificant

market risk sensitivity torchmark’s investment securities are exposed to interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since 96 of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixedrate investments the portfolio is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value under normal market conditions we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and the intent to hold these investments to maturity the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however as is permitted by gaap these liabilities are not recorded at fair value 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2015  and 2014  this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points

realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits we also incur acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses generally occur only incidentally usually as the result of bonds sold because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by write downs due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause periodtoperiod trends of net income that are not indicative of historical core operating results or predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

as described in  note 4—investments  under the caption otherthantemporary impairments  we have not incurred any write downs in our fixed maturity portfolio as a result of otherthantemporary impairment for the years 2013  through 2015  during 2013  we sold investment real estate for an aftertax loss of 19 million of which 17 million had been written down due to otherthantemporary impairment earlier in that year 

financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

insurance subsidiary liquidity the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes the funds to provide for policy benefits the majority of which are paid in future periods are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities to meet these longterm obligations in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restriction the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains while the leading source of the excess cash is investment income due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income 

  

parent company liquidity cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt operating expenses of the parent and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders in 2015  the parent received 466 million  of cash dividends from its subsidiaries compared with 479 million  in 2014  and 488 million  in 2013  including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations shareholder dividends and other expenses but before share repurchases torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in 2015  of approximately 358 million compared with 377 million in 2014  and 364 million in 2013  parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes such as insurance subsidiary capital or financing needs strategic acquisitions or share repurchases in 2016  it is expected that the parent company will receive approximately 450 million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries and that approximately 320 to 330 million will be available as excess cash flow certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 12—shareholders’ equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been more than sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company 

index to financial statements 

shortterm borrowings an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 750 million in july 2014 torchmark replaced a 600 million facility with this agreement as discussed in note 11—debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  under the caption commercial paper  the facility like the previous is further designated as a backup line of credit for a commercial paper program as of december 31 2015  we had available 332 million of additional borrowing capacity under this new facility compared with 314 million a year earlier there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended december 31 2015  

  

in summary torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2016  and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of additional debt additional borrowings on our shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing 

  

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were 11 billion  in 2015  compared with 880 million  in 2014  and 11 billion  in 2013  in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies received proceeds from maturities calls and repayments of fixed maturities in the amount of 376 million in 2015 compared with 273 million in 2014 and 494 million in 2013 

  

our cash and shortterm investments were 116 million  at yearend 2015  and 82 million  at yearend 2014  additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 138 billion at december 31 2015  however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as a part of its aforementioned credit facility torchmark had outstanding 177 million  in standby letters of credit at december 31 2015  compared with 198 million  a year earlier these letters are issued among our subsidiaries one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer and have no impact on company obligations as a whole any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of offshore captive reinsurers might require torchmark to obtain thirdparty financing which could cause an immaterial increase in financing costs 

  

as of december 31 2015  we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities all of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 15—commitments and contingencies   in the notes to consolidated financial statements

capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in   note 11—debt   in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the current maturity of funded debt   longterm funded debt and shareholders’ equity a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 11  

  

the carrying value of the funded debt was 993 million  at december 31 2015  compared with 992 million  a year earlier torchmark has a 6375 senior note that matures on june 15 2016 with a par value and book value of 250 million  as this issue matures within one year it has been reclassified to short term debt torchmark intends to refinance the debt during calendar 2016 with a hybrid debt instrument 

  

our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of 325 of company action level regulatory capital under riskbased capital rbc a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital the 325 target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows the relatively low risk of their product mix and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark at december 31 2015  our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had rbc ratios of approximately 320 should we experience impairments andor ratings downgrades within its fixed maturity portfolio in the future the ratio could fall below targeted levels in such a case management believes more than sufficient liquidity exists at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the targeted ratio 

as noted under the caption summary of operations  in this report we have an ongoing share repurchase program under this program we acquired 6 million shares at a cost of 359 million in 2015  7 million shares at a cost of 375 million in 2014  and 8 million shares for 360 million in 2013  the majority of purchased shares are retired each

torchmark has continually increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years in the first quarter of 2013  it was increased to 01133  per share from 010 per share in the first quarter of 2014  it was raised to 01267  per share finally in the first quarter of 2015  dividends were raised to 0135  per share 

  

shareholders’ equity was 41 billion  at december 31 2015  compared with 47 billion  at december 31 2014  during the twelve months since december 31 2014  shareholders’ equity was reduced by the 359 million in share purchases under the repurchase program 60 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises and 750 million of aftertax unrealized losses in the fixed maturity portfolio however it was increased by 527 million  of net income 

  

we plan to use excess cash available at the parent company as efficiently as possible in the future possible uses of excess cash flow include but are not limited to share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in fixed maturities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies 

we maintain a significant availableforsale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets while invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets from time to time the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity because of the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows consistently generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios

the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  



 

fasb guidance provides for an option which if elected would permit us to value our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets  however unlike the accounting rule which permits us to account for changes in our availableforsale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income the guidance requires such changes to be recorded in earnings because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results therefore we have not elected this option

am best states that it assigns an a superior rating to insurance companies that have in its opinion a superior ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations it assigns an a excellent rating to insurance companies that have in its opinion an excellent ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations 

the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard  poor’s corporation sp to those insurers which have very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments which differs from the highestrated insurers only to a small degree an insurer rated a has strong capacity to meet its financial commitments but it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than insurers in higherrated categories the plus sign  or minus sign  shows the relative standing within the major rating category 

  

in the third quarter of 2014 standard and poors sp revised its outlook on torchmarks capital position to a negative outlook that updated outlook was due to sps view at that time at certain internal components of torchmarks capital position rather than a change in the capital position itself however during the fourth quarter of 2015  sp formally reviewed our operations and financial outlook based on their review they revised their outlook from negative to stable and confirmed our aa financial strength ratings at our insurance subsidiaries and torchmark corporations senior debt a credit rating we intend to maintain adequate capital levels for sp and any changes to our capital position to maintain such levels are not expected to have any significant impact on our share repurchase program or our financial results in future periods

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries such punitive damage claims may have the potential for significant adverse results since torchmark and its subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 15—commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits    due to the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies   in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

approximately 85  of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2015  were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  under the caption future policy benefits  otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended december 31 2015  

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs  certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note   1 — significant accounting policies  under the caption deferred acquisition costs  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  additionally the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies known as the value of insurance purchased is included in deferred acquisition costs our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1 

  

approximately 99 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2015  were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2015  

  

the remaining 1 of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31 2015  

  

policy claims and other benefits payable  this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

  

valuation of fixed maturities  we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to

be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to manage risk we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk   sensitivity  in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition  in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

at times the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixedmaturity investments is presented in note 1—significant accounting policies  and in note 4—investments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the captions fair value measurements  in both notes 

  

impairment of investments  we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments where fair value has declined below carrying value and that have become impaired in value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an otherthantemporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments  and realized gains and   losses  in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans  we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2015  our gross liability under these funded plans was 477 million  but was offset by assets of 308 million  

  

index to financial statements 

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans for example a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2015  and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2015  

  



  

 

the company determines mortality assumptions through the use of published mortality tables that reflect broadbased studies of mortality and published longevity improvement scales during 2014 the company revised the mortality assumptions based on an evaluation of a new mortality table and longevity scale released by the society of actuaries the change in these assumptions added approximately 26 million to the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014 

  

the criteria used to determine the primary assumptions are discussed in note 9—postretirement benefits   in the notes to consolidated financial statements  while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to us note 9  also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies and other related data

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

annuity products include singlepremium and flexiblepremium deferred annuities annuities in each of the three years ending december 31 2014 comprised less than 1 of premium 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses these assumptions are based on company experience and projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

  

index to financial statements underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports pharmacy data doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

  

reserves

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

index to financial statements risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is based on its proportional share of the premium in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

medicare part d the medicare part d program is regulated at the federal level by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms this agency periodically examines torchmark’s participating subsidiaries 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in indiana nebraska ohio and new york 

  

insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a regulated industry populated by many firms we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market the development maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical adequate compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical in direct response continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits 

  

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations we serve primarily the middleincome market for individual protection life and health insurance and as a result we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of a significant sustained economic downturn or otherwise then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether 

  

variations in expected to actual rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could materially negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test expectedtoactual results actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set accordingly we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income 

  

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways including the following limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies 

  

rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could potentially have a negative effect on our operations by limiting our access to capital markets increasing the cost of debt impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries or making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

  

index to financial statements ratings reflect only the rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control in addition rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered the models changes to the models could impact the rating agencies’ judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

reputational risk 

  

damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business negative publicity published through traditional media internet social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts the ability to market our products and the persistency of our block of inforce policies 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

  

our life products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches labor union members and sales via direct response solicitation deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to unsolicited direct response marketing could negatively affect this business 

  

health insurance marketplace risks 

  

the health insurance market is subject to substantial legislative scrutiny legislative changes could impact our medicare supplement medicare part d and other supplemental health businesses the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business 

  

competition in the health market can be significant sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors in addition some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or under price new sales in order to gain market share we choose not to compete for market share based on these terms accordingly changes in the competitive landscape including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products 

  

an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability 

  

index to financial statements investment risks 

  

our investments are subject to market and credit risks our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixedmaturity and shortterm investments a significant portion of our fixedmaturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels financial market performance disruptions in credit markets general economic conditions legislative changes particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control additionally because the majority of our investments are longerterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity significant increases in interest rates widening of credit spreads or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable in that case the unrealized loss will be realized at which point we would take an impairment charge reducing our net income 

  

difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses   a default by an issuer could result in a significant otherthantemporary impairment of that investment causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income the risk of default is higher for bonds with longerterm maturities which we acquire in order to match our longterm insurance obligations we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all material otherthantemporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus leading to lower riskbased capital ratios potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries while we intend to hold our investments until maturity a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income 

  

a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

  

liquidity risks 

  

our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available primarily dividends from our insurance subsidiaries as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity also include a variety of shortterm and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper longterm debt intercompany financing and reinsurance 

  

index to financial statements the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income excluding capital gains on an annual noncumulative basis or 10 of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval accordingly impairments in invested assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us a principal source of our cash flow 

  

we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries although we do not anticipate changes changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses additionally the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock 

  

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital   should credit spreads widen in the future the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility therefore as a result our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders not our investors state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising licensing agents policy forms capital adequacy solvency reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business should these changes to our business occur we may be unable to maintain all 

  

index to financial statements required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations which may change from time to time if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines 

  

we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives in recent years there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries by insurance regulatory authorities which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our agents or employees are improper these actions can result in substantial fines penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may even absent any particular regulatory authority’s interpretation of an issue changing cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to our practices that may in some cases limit our ability to grow impact regulatory capital requirements or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business 

  

currently the us federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance however the doddfrank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 establishes a federal insurance office fio within the department of the treasury and the patient protection and affordable care act affordable care act created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight cciio originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct regulation of the insurance industry we cannot predict what impact if any the fio and cciio as well as any other proposals for federal regulation of insurance could have on our business results of operations or financial condition we also cannot predict what impact actions taken by cms as the regulator of our medicare part d business could have on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry including the products it offers could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income or negatively effect our ability to sell some of our products 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may affect our financial statements reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability 

  

if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws or 

  

index to financial statements any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries we are and in the future may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants and in certain of these matters the plaintiffs are seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis however the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states in which we operate juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit 

  

our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases the costs of settlement or judgments against us or changes in our operations that could result from litigation substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation which in turn could materially harm our business and our business prospects 

  

catastrophic event risk 

  

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality or morbidity caused by events such as a pandemic hurricane earthquake or manmade catastrophes including acts of terrorism or war which may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 

  

information security and technology risk 

  

a network security breach the introduction of malware in our computing environment a disaster or other unanticipated event could affect the computer systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations despite our implementation of cyber security measures to protect our hardware software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access our computing environment could be subject to physical and electronic breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our systems 

  

we retain confidential information in our computer systems anyone who is able to circumvent our cyber security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access view misappropriate alter or delete information in the systems including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information in addition an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access use or disclosure of their information any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in an inappropriate access use or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter people from purchasing our products subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical legal and other expenses 

  

index to financial statements in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an industrial accident a blackout or a terrorist attack or war our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time even if our employees are able to report to work they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed and if existing contingency plans cannot function as designed

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

torchmark and its subsidiaries in common with the insurance industry in general are subject to litigation including claims involving tax matters alleged breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmark’s subsidiaries employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on torchmark’s financial condition future operating results or liquidity however assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forwardlooking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges juries and appellate courts in the future this bespeaks caution particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit 

  

as previously reported torchmark subsidiaries are currently the subject of audits regarding the identification reporting and escheatment of unclaimed property arising from life insurance policies and a limited number of annuity contracts these audits are being conducted by private entities that have contracted with fortyseven states through their respective departments of revenue and have not resulted in any financial assessment from any state nor indicated any liability the audits are wideranging and seek large amounts of data regarding claims handling procedures and payments of contract benefits arising from unreported death claims amounts that could be payable to insurance beneficiaries and to the states for the escheatment of abandoned property represent insurance liabilities and are included in the company’s estimate of policy benefits under the caption “total policy liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets  no estimate of range can be made for loss contingencies related to possible administrative penalties or amounts that could be payable to the states for the escheatment of abandoned property at this time

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and to a limited extent annuities to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the insurance product lines of life health medicare part d and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment as described in note 14—business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we reorganized our segment structure to separate our medicare part d health insurance business from our other health insurance activities as a standalone segment because management determined that part d meets the criteria of a distinct segment under accounting guidance prior period results have been retrospectively adjusted for comparability 

  

insurance product line segments as fully explained in note 14  the insurance product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and the administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is 

  

net investment income 

less 

required interest on net policy liabilities 

financing costs 

  

the tables in note 14 reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ending december 31 2014 additionally this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates yeartoyear comparability and which reconciles to net income that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business 

  

acquisition on november 1 2012 we acquired family heritage a previously privatelyheld supplemental health insurance carrier information about this acquisition can be found in note 6—acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the results of family heritage subsequent to our acquisition are included in this discussion within our health insurance segment

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations net income was 543 million in 2014 compared with 528 million in 2013 net income declined slightly in 2013 from 529 million in 2012 on a diluted per share basis 2014 net income rose 8 to 409 after a 5 increase in 2013 net income per diluted share in 2013 rose to 379 from 360 in 2012 the pershare results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program also each year’s per share net income was affected by realized investment gains which were 012 003 and 017 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively more information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses in this report where there is a more complete discussion also as explained in note 14—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments additionally we do not consider nonoperating items which are not related to the current ongoing reporting performance of our segments as indicated in the chart above to be part of our segment operating income 

  

as shown in the above chart aftertax segment results of operations rose each year over the prior year from 507 million in 2012 to 531 million in 2013 to 534 million in 2014 the primary contributor to the growth in both 2014 and 2013 was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment in which margins rose 11 million in 2014 and 36 million in 2013 the life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented also contributing to growth in income in both years was our health insurance segment which provided 3 million of additional margin in 2014 and 33 million in 2013 the 2013 larger increase in health margin was primarily due to the inclusion of family heritage’s health business for a full year since its acquisition in late 2012 family heritage accounted for 32 million of the increase in 2013 margin margins for the medicare part d segment declined 23 in 2014 to 27 million primarily due to two costly hepatitis c drugs which were not required to be covered until well after our 2014 pricing was finalized as discussed more fully later in this report 

  

excess investment income the measure of profitability of our investment segment increased to 225 million or 3 over the prior year amount of 219 million this was the first time in four years the dollar 

  

index to financial statements amount of excess investment income exceeded the prior year’s amount in 2013 excess investment income declined 8 although interest rates rebounded slightly during the first half of 2014 the low interest rate environment continued to pressure investment yields and spreads related to required interest on net policy liabilities throughout the threeyear period excess investment income has also been hampered by a lag in government reimbursement of medicare part d costs the effects of the lowinterestrate environment and the impact of the part d business on investment income is discussed more fully later in this report under the caption investments  

  

the inclusion of family heritage’s administrative expenses for a full year for the first time added 8 million of additional administrative expense in 2013 in addition in both 2014 and 2013 there were increases in stock compensation expense which negatively affected the results during the year stock compensation increased 7 million in 2014 and 4 million in 2013 these increases in stock compensation expense resulted primarily from the increase in the value of torchmark’s stock rather than an increase in the number of grants 

  

total revenues rose 5 in 2014 to 396 billion after having risen 5 in 2013 to 377 billion life premium rose 4 or 81 million in 2014 to 197 billion life premium increased 77 million in 2013 to 189 billion net investment income rose 16 million in 2013 and rose 3 or 19 million in 2014 health premium increased 7 to 124 billion in 2014 and contributed 76 million to 2014 revenue growth after having gained 11 to 117 billion in 2013 health premium contributed 119 million to 2013 revenue growth 

  

life insurance premium and underwriting margins have grown steadily in each of the three years ending december 31 the increase in life premium was driven by sales growth and improvements in persistency while premium and underwriting margins grew margin as a percent of premium fell slightly in 2014 to 28 after increasing from 28 to 29 from 2012 to 2013 these fluctuations were due primarily to changes in mortality net life sales increased 12 in 2014 to 378 million after decreasing 1 in 2013 the life insurance segment is discussed further in this report under the caption life insurance  

  

with regard to health insurance we primarily market medicare supplement insurance other limitedbenefit products including cancer and accident and health products as noted earlier 2013 and 2014 health premiums were positively affected by the inclusion of family heritage’s health premium for the full years the inclusion of family heritage also caused our limitedbenefit health premium which is their primary focus to exceed our medicare supplement premium in 2013 for the first time in several years prior to 2013 medicare supplement was our largest contributor to total health premium limitedbenefit health continued to exceed medicare supplement in 2014 limitedbenefit health premium was 446 million in 2014 compared with 447 million in 2013 limitedbenefit premium increased 50 over 2012 limitedbenefit health premium of 298 million a result of the inclusion of family heritage’s business medicare supplement premium was 423 million in 2014 increasing over the prior year’s premium for the first time in many years as lapses exceeded new sales in prior year periods medicare supplement premium was 417 million in 2013 and 432 million in 2012 the increase in 2014 premium resulted from sales in 2014 to certain large groups health margins have remained somewhat stable as a percentage of premium throughout the threeyear period see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

  

we also market medicare part d prescription drug insurance our medicare part d premium rose 16 in 2014 to 348 million compared with 300 million in 2013 and 318 million in 2012 the higher premiums in both 2014 and 2012 were due to higher levels of lowincome autoenrollees in our plans for those years due to increased competition in the 2013 plan year we experienced a decrease in 2013 part d premium medicare part d margins were negatively impacted in 2014 however by several factors including two high cost hepatitis c drugs the coverage of which was mandated by the center for medicare and medicaid services cms in early 2014 well after our 2014 pricing was finalized new taxes under the affordable care act and other higher drug costs due to rebate restructuring as a percentage of premium margins fell from 12 in 2013 to 8 in 2014 for the 2015 plan year we will have a significantly lower number of autoenrollees which should reduce our exposure to hepatitis c drug claims because approximately 85 of these claims in 2014 were related to autoenrollees for more information on our medicare part d business please refer to our discussion under the caption medicare part d  

  

index to financial statements we do not currently market annuities see the caption annuities for discussion of the annuity segment 

  

the investment segment’s pretax profitability or excess investment income is based on three major components net investment income required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to insurance products and financing costs in 2014 net investment income rose 3 compared with 2 in 2013 as we view our segments net investment income rose 3 in both periods at the same time our investment portfolio grew 3 and 9 in 2014 and 2013 respectively in recent years net investment income has not grown as fast as the portfolio one reason that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of also there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested during which the funds are held in cash growth in total investment income is also somewhat negatively affected by torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments in 2014 net investment income was negatively impacted by events affecting our medicare part d business under the program we are required to cover certain claim costs in the current period that are the federal government’s responsibility but are not reimbursed until late in the next calendar year this delay in reimbursement substantially reduced our funds available for investment in 2014 with the result of reduced investment income in 2014 and 2015 

  

the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets the lower newmoney yields resulting from the lowinterestrate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow at approximately the same rate that net policy liabilities have grown we have implemented certain strategies to offset this effect including increasing premium rates on sales of new products as discussed under the caption investments  financing costs which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and shortterm debt are also deducted from net investment income financing costs in 2013 were stable at 80 million but declined 5 in 2014 the 2014 decline resulted from the maturity and repayment in 2013 of our 945 million principal amount 7 3  8  notes 

  

torchmark’s current investment policy regarding fixed maturities limits new fixed maturity acquisitions to investmentgrade securities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives approximately 97 of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which 96 were investment grade at december 31 2014 the average quality rating of the portfolio was a the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alta mortgages no direct investment in residential mortgages no counterparty risks no credit default swaps or other derivative contracts see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and n ote 4—investments in the notes to consolidated statements of operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment 

  

in 2012 and 2013 we engaged in a debt restructuring program which resulted in a reduction in financing costs we issued two new debt offerings during 2012 our 300 million principal amount 38 senior notes due 2022 and our 125 million principal amount 5875 junior subordinated debentures due 2052 both issued in september proceeds from the senior notes were 297 million but 150 million were purchased by our insurance subsidiaries and were eliminated in consolidation proceeds from this offering provided funding for the retirement of our 7 3  8  senior notes which matured and were repaid in august 2013 and for the acquisition of family heritage in november 2012 the 121 million net proceeds from the subordinated debentures were used to fund the call of our 120 million principal amount 71 trust originated preferred securities in october 2012 more information on these transactions can be found in note 6—acquisition and note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 

  

in each of the years 2012 through 2014 net income was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring nonoperating items we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations as reported in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements under the caption settlements  we were involved in certain issues in which we incurred settlement losses and expenses in connection with the 2012 purchase of family heritage as described in note 6 — acquisition  we incurred 29 million of acquisitionrelated expenses 19 million after tax during 2013 torchmark incurred a state guaranty fund assessment in the amount of 12 million 751 thousand after tax resulting from events in years prior to 2012 also in 2013 we resolved a legal matter related to a noninsurance issue in the amount of 500 thousand 325 thousand after tax and settled additional litigation related to prior years in the amount of 86 million 56 million after tax during 2014 torchmark accrued for certain litigation matters in the net amount of 37 million 24 million after tax that were not directly related to its insurance operations additionally torchmark received 13 million 853 thousand after tax in settlement of litigation regarding investments also in 2014 the company recorded 82 million in administrative settlements 53 million after tax related to benefits paid for deaths occurring in prior years where claims were not filed all of these items have been expensed in the consolidated statements of operations  however as described in note 1  we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are nonoperating items when evaluating the results of current operations and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods 

  

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises the board of directors has authorized the company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management in consultation with the board determines to be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december 31 2014

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue net sales is annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

  

annualized life premium in force was 204 billion at december 31 2014 an increase of 5 over 196 billion a year earlier annualized life premium in force was 190 billion at december 31 2012

the american income exclusive agency has historically focused primarily on marketing to members of labor unions while the labor union market is still the backbone of american income’s business the agency has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help to ensure sustainable growth it is torchmark’s highest margin business the american income agency was also the largest contributor to life premium and net sales of any torchmark distribution method in 2014 life premium for this agency rose 7 to 766 million after having risen 8 in 2013 net sales rose 13 in 2014 to 172 million after having declined 4 in 2013 net sales rose 12 in 2012 the average face amount of policies issued in 2014 was approximately 30 thousand as is the case with all of torchmark’s agency distribution systems continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count the american income agent count was 6434 at december 31 2014 compared with 5302 a year earlier an increase of 21 the agent count increased 2 in 2013 and 18 in 2012 the average agent count for 2014 was 5868 the average agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the year management’s primary objective is to grow middle management in the agency to help ensure sustainable growth this is being achieved through an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train personnel we have also begun providing more homeoffice and webinar training programs these programs are designed to provide each agent from new recruits to top level managers coaching and instruction specifically designed for each individual’s level of experience and responsibilities we believe that these initiatives will continue to promote enthusiasm in the field and will drive increases in agent retention and sales activity 

  

the direct response unit offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of directtoconsumer marketing approaches which include direct mailings insert media and electronic media these different approaches support and complement one another in the unit’s efforts to reach the consumer the direct response unit’s growth has been fueled by constant innovation in recent years electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology and has focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center 

  

while the juvenile market is an important source of sales it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders who are more likely to respond favorably to a direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 

  

the direct response operation accounted for 36 of our life insurance premium during 2014 increasing 6 over 2013 premium life premium for this unit rose 5 in 2013 and 6 in 2012 net sales rose 10 to 158 million in 2014 after a 2 increase in 2013 due to growth in electronic media activity firstyear collected premium increased 8 to 100 million in 2014 and was flat in 2013 compared to 2012 the average face amount of policies issued in 2014 was approximately 17 thousand 

  

index to financial statements the liberty national exclusive agency markets individual and group life insurance to middleincome customers life premium income for this agency was 272 million in 2014 a 1 decrease compared with 276 million in 2013 life premium declined 2 in 2013 from 2012 first year collected premium increased 1 in 2014 however after having declined 4 in 2013 the average face amount of life policies issued in 2014 was approximately 23 thousand 

  

the liberty national agency’s net sales rose 11 to 34 million in 2014 after having declined 4 a year earlier the increase in net sales during 2014 marks the first increase in several years reflecting changes in structure of the agency that management has put in place in recent years as is the case with all of our agencies sales are driven by the size of the agent force the liberty agency had 1498 producing agents at december 31 2014 compared with 1430 a year earlier an increase of 5 the producing agent count increased 1 during 2013 from 1419 the average agent count for 2014 was 1505 agent counts declined during the fourth quarter of 2014 as the agency focused somewhat less on recruiting due to the increased emphasis on annual worksite renewals 

  

our long term plans to grow this agency involve expansion from smalltown markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers we believe that expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated lesspenetrated areas will help create long term agency growth additionally a prospecting training program has helped to improve the ability of agents to develop new worksite marketing business 

  

we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the military agency the united american independent agency and other small sales agencies the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who sell primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of wholelife products with term insurance riders military premium represented 9 of life premium at december 31 2014 the united american independent agency represented approximately 1 of torchmark’s total life premium at that date as their sales of torchmark products consist primarily of health insurance

gross margins as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense rose 2 in 2014 and 7 in 2013 the margin increased to 556 million in 2014 after rising to 545 million in 2013 the steady growth in premium contributed to margin growth in all periods as a percentage of premium however an increase in policy obligations resulted in a slightly lower margin in 2014 policy obligations fluctuate from period to period as a result of mortality in both 2013 and 2014 percentage margins were positively affected by our conservation program and the permitted increases in the deferrals of our internetrelated direct response acquisition costs 

  

index to financial statements health insurance health insurance sold by torchmark includes primarily medicare supplement coverage to enrollees in the federal medicare program cancer coverage accident coverage and other limitedbenefit supplemental health products as discussed in note 14—business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  medicare part d is now reported as a separate torchmark segment and is no longer included in the discussion of torchmark’s other health products see the discussion of medicare part d later in this report in this discussion of health business all health coverage plans other than medicare supplement are classified here as limitedbenefit plans

health premium rose 1 to 869 million in 2014 after having increased 18 in 2013 to 864 million however if the premium of family heritage were removed for comparability in 2013 and 2012 health premium would have declined 4 in 2013 the decline in 2013 premium resulted primarily from a runoff of a block of discontinued hospitalsurgical plans this runoff had been ongoing for a number of years in 2014 this runoff is thought to have substantially run its course net sales increased 63 in 2014 to 181 million after having increased 42 in 2013 the 2014 increase was caused by the more than double growth in medicare supplement sales these sales occurred in both the united american independent agency and in the direct response group these increases were primarily the result of strong group sales of medicare supplement which can vary significantly from period to period the 2013 increase was primarily a result of the acquisition of family heritage which contributed 44 million to the growth in 2013 compared with 7 million in 2012 firstyear collected premium increased 18 in 2014 and 47 in 2013 as a result of the increased sales in both 2014 and 2013 and the addition of family heritage firstyear premium for a full year in 2013 for the first time 

  

the addition of family heritage’s sales and premium from limitedbenefit products has resulted in limitedbenefit health premium exceeding medicare supplement premium income in 2013 for the first time in several years and continuing to lead in premium in 2014 however due to increased medicare supplement group sales medicare supplement net sales exceeded limitedbenefit net sales in 2014 limitedbenefit premium represented 51 of total health premium in 2014 and 52 in 2013 but represented 41 in 2012 however as noted above medicare supplement sales rose 139 to 106 

  

index to financial statements million in 2014 due to the high group sales which represented 59 of net health sales in 2014 medicare supplement sales were 40 of the total in 2013 and 59 in 2012 as mentioned previously group medicare supplement sales fluctuate significantly from period to period 

  

we do not expect recent health care reform activity to have a significant impact on our operations we don’t sell any products subject to the affordable care act and don’t believe that consumer demand for the types of supplemental health products we sell will be diminished while we will be subject to certain federal taxes on a small portion of our existing health business going forward we don’t expect the amount of these taxes to be material 

  

the ua independent agency is torchmark’s largest in terms of health premium income producing 35 of health premium in 2014 this agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose sizes range from very large multistate organizations down to oneperson offices all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies torchmark had 3161 active producing agents at december 31 2014 compared with 2414 a year earlier this agency is our largest producer of medicare supplement insurance with 286 million or 68 of our medicare supplement premium income in 2014 net sales for this agency were 84 million in 2014 consisting almost entirely of medicare supplement business these net sales were more than double the net sales of 41 million in 2013 in 2013 they had declined 2 total health premium income for the ua independent agency was 305 million in 2014 an increase of 2 from 298 million in 2013 premium income had declined very slightly in 2013 

  

the family heritage exclusive agency was acquired by torchmark’s acquisition of family heritage on november 1 2012 as discussed in note 6—acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements  this agency markets primarily limitedbenefit supplemental health insurance in nonurban areas most of their policies include a cashback feature such as a returnofpremium whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy the family heritage agency is our largest agency in terms of limitedbenefit health net sales adding 47 million in net sales in 2014 compared with 44 million in 2013 an increase of 8 this agency’s 205 million in health premium income during 2014 represented 24 of torchmark’s total premium in 2014 increased 7 over 2013 premium of 191 million the producing agent count was 785 agents at december 31 2014 compared with 695 agents at december 31 2013 the average agent count for 2014 was 740 the agent count was 702 at december 31 2012 management expects to grow this agency going forward through geographic expansion and incorporation of torchmark’s recruiting programs 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency represented 25 of all torchmark health premium income at 222 million in 2014 the liberty agency markets limitedbenefit health supplemental products consisting primarily of cancer insurance much of the liberty’s health business is now generated through worksite marketing which targets small businesses of 10 to 25 employees in 2014 health premium income in the agency declined 8 from prior year premium of 241 million after also declining 8 in 2013 these premium declines were due primarily to the runoff of a block of discontinued hospitalsurgical business as well as an earlier restructuring of this agency to a variablecost commissiondriven model the liberty agency experienced growth in net health sales in 2014 of 22 to 17 million the agent count at liberty was 1498 at 2014 year end an increase of 5 over year end 2013 and 6 over year end 2012 

  

the american income exclusive agency predominantly a life insurance distribution channel was our fourth largest health insurance distributor based on premium income in 2014 its health plans are comprised of various limitedbenefit plans approximately 68 of the agency’s 2014 health premium was from accident policies sales of the plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 

  

health premium at this agency was 79 million in both 2014 and 2013 in 2013 it had declined slightly from 80 million however health net sales rose 31 in 2014 to 9 million after falling 20 in 2013 to 7 million because this agency focuses on life products health net sales comprised only 5 of the american income agency’s total net sales in 2014 

  

index to financial statements direct response  primarily a life operation also offers health insurance which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups in 2014 net health sales were 23 million compared with 4 million in 2013 and 5 million in 2012 the large increase in direct response net sales in 2014 was due to the addition of a large medicare supplement group which is not indicative of a trend in 2014 health net sales for this group represented approximately 13 of direct response’s total life and health net sales direct response health premium income was 59 million in 2014 increasing 9 over 2013 premium of 54 million health premium declined 7 in 2013 

  

as presented in the following table torchmark’s health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense increased 1 to 199 million in 2014 after an increase of 20 to 197 million in 2013 family heritage contributed 32 million of the 33 million 2013 increase as a percentage of premium income margins were 23 in both 2014 and 2013 as compared with 22 in 2012

total medicare part d premium was 348 million in 2014 compared with 300 million in 2013 and 318 million in 2012 part d net sales were 186 million in 2014 compared with 79 million in 2013 and 114 million in 2012 the unusual increase in 2014 net sales was due to the addition in 2014 of the autoenrollees as noted below we count only sales to new firsttime enrollees in net sales and the majority of premium income is from previous enrollees total enrollees in the program were 269 thousand at the beginning of the 2014 plan year 254 thousand at the beginning of the 2013 plan year and 215 thousand at the beginning of the 2012 plan year 

  

changes in part d premium generally result from changes in the number of enrollees which are heavily influenced by new sales in 2012 the company issued a new lower cost part d plan allowing us to pick up a large number of autoenrollees in 21 regions with resulting higher sales in 2013 due to intensified price competition we qualified for new lowincome autoenrollees in only 7 regions but were able to keep prior year autoenrollees in 14 regions and maintain our presence in 21 regions in 2014 torchmark qualified to receive new part d autoenrollees in 15 regions and also qualified to retain prior year autoenrollees in 8 regions for a total of 23 regions these variations in the number of new autoenrollees caused the changes in part d net sales premium and enrollee counts including the large increases in 2014 and the declines in 2013 the 2013 decline was also influenced by the loss of several employer group part d cases at the end of 2012 

  

as presented in the following table margins decreased 23 in 2014 to 27 million even though premium rose 16 premiums were increased for the year 2014 to cover higher anticipated nondeferred acquisition expenses as such we expected significantly lower obligation ratios in 2014 however due primarily to unexpected costs related to two hepatitis c drugs the coverage of which was mandated by cms administration early in 2014 well after our 2014 pricing was finalized the obligation ratios for 2014 increased from 82 to 83 nondeferred acquisition cost ratios were significantly higher as planned in our pricing due to 1 new taxes imposed by the affordable care act 2 higher costs related to a change in the structure of drug rebates and 3 higher costs related to the increased volume of enrollees as a percentage of premium underwriting margin for 2014 fell to 8 compared with 12 for 2013 in 2013 margins increased 6 to 35 million even though premium declined 6 as a percentage of premium margins rose from 10 to 12 the benefit ratio declined 2 as a result of lower claims experience in the group market in 2013 group part d claims tend to fluctuate from year to year

for 2015 we do not expect hepatitis c claims to have the same negative impact on margins that they had in 2014 as our 2015 pricing reflects the cost of these drugs in addition we will have significantly less autoenrollees in 2015 autoenrollees accounted for approximately 85 of our 2014 hepatitis c claims 

  

total enrollees in the program were 249 thousand at the beginning of the 2015 plan year compared with 269 thousand in 2014 we expect that part d margins will be flat to slightly lower in 2015 based on a preliminary analysis of the risk scores and claims history of our 2015 enrollees 

  

we participate in the medicare part d program because it complements our medicare supplement products it provides us with incremental income we have extensive experience with the seniorage market and the government assurances with regard to the risksharing agreements for participating insurers limit our risk additionally due to our experience with service to the seniorage market and the use of our existing direct response marketing system entry to this business required little new investment however as with any governmentsponsored program the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market 

  

annuities our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2014 2013 and 2012 were 136 billion 138 billion and 135 billion respectively underwriting income was 43 million 39 million and 35 million in each of the respective years 

  

while the fixed annuity account balance has remained relatively stable each year over the prior year underwriting income has increased each year over the prior year policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year the majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are not based on account size a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements which can result in negative net policy obligations in the threeyear period however spreads tended to level as crediting rates reached guaranteed minimums 

  

we do not currently market annuity products favoring instead protectionoriented life and health insurance products therefore we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward

insurance administrative expenses rose 1 in 2014 after having increased 8 in 2013 as a percentage of premium they increased 1 in 2013 to 59 but declined 3 in 2014 to 56 the inclusion of family heritage’s administrative expenses accounted for 81 million of the 135 million increase in total administrative expense in 2013 nonsalary employee costs increased 19 in 2013 but fell back 16 in 2014 close to 2012 levels these fluctuations were caused in large part by adjustments to pension expenses primarily due to changes in interest rates in the financial markets stock compensation expense has risen in each successive year as the value of torchmark stock has increased resulting in higher values for grants of stock and options as well as positive company performance that caused an increase in the expense related to performance share grants as stated in note 14—business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 

  

as described in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we described certain litigation matters that were incurred in the years 2014 and 2013 that were not directly related to our ongoing core insurance operations management does not consider these litigation matters to be part of insurance administration expense but instead considers them to be nonoperating expenses also during 2013 torchmark recorded an additional nonoperating charge involving a state guaranty fund assessment in the amount of 12 million resulting from events in years prior to 2012 we incurred expenses of 29 million related to the acquisition of family heritage in late 2012 as described in note 6— acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements  while all of these nonoperating expenses were included in “operating expenses” for the respective year in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with accounting guidance they are removed by management from consideration when evaluating segment operating results 

  

  

index to financial statements investments we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14— business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used over 61 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  

  

      

index to financial statements excess investment income increased 6 million or 3 in 2014 over the prior year excess investment income declined 18 million or 8 in 2013 excess investment income has been pressured over the past three years as a result of the impact of lower interest rates on net investment income coupled with the increase in required interest on net policy liabilities discussed later under this caption on a per diluted share basis excess investment income increased 8 to 170 in 2014 excess investment income declined 2 to 157 per share in 2013 after having risen 3 in the prior year the greater increase in 2014 pershare amounts as well as the smaller decline in 2013 relative to the changes in dollar amounts for excess investment income are a result of share repurchases 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income as adjusted for the segment analysis which rose 3 to 758 million in 2014 it increased 3 to 735 million in 2013 from 716 million in 2012 the inclusion of family heritage acquired in late 2012 added 21 million of net investment income in 2013 compared with 3 million in 2012 accounting for the majority of the 2013 increase however growth in net investment income has generally been slower than growth in mean invested assets in recent years due to the declining interest rate environment in 2014 fixed maturity yields averaged 591 on a taxequivalent and effectiveyield basis compared with 594 in 2013 and 635 in 2012 even though mean invested assets have increased each period net investment income has grown at a slower pace as a result of the decline in average yields in a declining rate environment the overall portfolio yield will decrease as new money is invested at lower prevailing yields the reduction in the average yields has primarily been the result of reinvesting proceeds from bonds that matured or were called at yield rates less than the rates we earned on the bonds before they matured or were called while family heritage added incrementally to net investment income during 2014 and 2013 its loweryielding portfolio has also contributed to the decline in the average fixedmaturity yield 

  

a major factor negatively affecting net investment income especially in 2012 and 2013 was calls of fixedmaturity securities during 2012 and to a lesser extent in 2013 we had an unusually large number of these calls including 339 million of bankissued hybrid securities in 2012 and 129 million in 2013 fixed maturity securities are more likely to be called in a declining interestrate environment as these callable securities can often be refinanced at lower prevailing rates in 2014 however call activity has been more limited we believe that it is unlikely that calls would have a material negative impact on investment income in the foreseeable future if our callable investments were called and the proceeds from those calls were reinvested at expected future new money rates during 2014 the proceeds from all dispositions have been reinvested at yield rates closer to the yield rates on the disposed assets 

  

net investment income has also been negatively affected in 2014 by the cms requirement for us to pay certain medicare part d claims costs during the current period that are ultimately the responsibility of the government but are not reimbursed until the following year because part d claims have been unusually high in 2014 due to the approval of new hepatitis c drugs discussed earlier in this report and higher overall drug costs we have incurred extensive upfront costs that will not be reimbursed by cms until late 2015 this delay in reimbursement has caused a delay in cash flows available for new investments that resulted in a loss of approximately 5 million of pretax net investment income in 2014 and will cause us to lose approximately 4 million of additional investment income in 2015 please refer to note 10¯supplemental disclosures of cash flow information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets 

  

   

while net investment income in recent years has been negatively impacted by the factors discussed above we would expect to see only modest declines in the average portfolio yield rate over the next few years compared with the larger declines in recent years we anticipate that less than 2 of fixed maturities 

  

index to financial statements on average are expected to run off each year over the next five years overall we are encouraged that the prospect of additional significant calls seems to be behind us and expected maturities should have lower yields than in the past 

  

excess investment income is reduced by the required interest on net insurance policy liabilities because we consider these amounts to be components of the profitability of our insurance segments required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force the great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interestrate protection policies not investment products and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for longduration insurance products formerly sfas 60 now incorporated into asc 9442005 this guidance mandates that interest rate assumptions be “locked in” for the life of that block of business each calendar year we set the assumed discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on the premiums received in the future from policies of that issue year and cannot be changed except in the event of a premium deficiency the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in as such the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years changes in the overall weightedaverage discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the in force business by issue year 

  

because actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weightedaverage discount rate of our in force block we don’t expect an extended lowinterestrate environment to cause a loss recognition event 

  

information about interest on policy liabilities is shown in the following table

the combined weighted average discount rate decreased in 2013 due to the inclusion of family heritage for a full year 

  

index to financial statements excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income

financing costs decreased 4 million or 5 in 2014 they were essentially flat in 2013 the decrease in financing costs in 2014 was due to the maturity and repayment of our 94 million par amount 7375 notes during the third quarter of 2013 the increase in financing costs in 2013 reflects the increased interest expense from the issuance in september 2012 of 300 million principal amount of our 38 senior notes due in 2022 150 million of which is eliminated in consolidation also in september 2012 we issued our 5875 junior subordinated debentures due 2052 for 125 million principal amount but called our 120 million 71 trust preferred securities one month later in both 2014 and 2013 interest on shortterm debt declined primarily because of the reduction in the weightedaverage interest rate on shortterm debt more information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the financial condition section of this report and in note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

as previously noted growth rates in our excess investment income decline when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs such as we have experienced in recent periods in an extended lowinterestrate environment the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower longterm rates we believe however the decline would be relatively slow as on average only 1 to 2 of fixed maturities are expected to run off each year over the next five years 

  

in response to the lower interest rates we raised the premium rates for new business on major life products in early 2012 and again in late 2013 the increased premium provides additional margin on these policies to help offset higher mandatory cash values and the possible future reductions in excess investment income despite these increases in premium rates we have continued to see growth in net sales 

  

excess investment income benefits from increases in longterm rates available on new investments and decreases in shortterm borrowing rates of these two factors higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at shortterm rates therefore torchmark would benefit if rates especially longterm rates were to rise 

  

index to financial statements investment acquisitions  torchmark’s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investmentgrade fixed maturities generally with long maturities maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date that meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities further we believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable if such longerterm securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives we consider investing in shortterm securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time during calendar years 2012 through 2014 torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities primarily with longerterm maturities as presented in the chart below 

  

the following table summarizes selected information for fixedmaturity purchases the effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield this date is commonly known as the “worst call date” two different average life calculations are shown average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date

we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment however the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 

  

during the three years 2012 through 2014 we have invested almost entirely in investmentgrade corporate bonds acquisitions in all three years have been primarily in industrial and utility bonds new cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations but has also been affected by other factors issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past three years were an important factor especially in 2012 calls increase funds available for investment but as noted earlier in this discussion they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called issuer calls were 160 million in 2014 344 million in 2013 and 650 million in 2012 the higher level of acquisitions in 2012 was primarily due to the additional funds available from the higher level of 2012 calls 

  

index to financial statements portfolio analysis because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms the following table presents a comparison of torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2014 with the latest industry data 

  

   

because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities an analysis of our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 is as follows

at december 31 2014 fixed maturities had a fair value of 145 billion compared with 129 billion at december 31 2013 at december 31 2014 fixed maturities were in a 17 billion net unrealized gain position compared with an unrealized gain position of 390 million at december 31 2013 approximately 82 of our fixed maturity assets at december 31 2014 at amortized cost were corporate bonds and 4 were redeemable preferred stocks this compares with 81 corporate bonds and 4 redeemable preferred stocks at year end 2013 on a combined basis residential mortgagebacked securities other assetbacked securities and collateralized debt obligations cdos were 1 of the assets at amortized cost at december 31 2014 the 68 million of cdos at amortized cost made up less than 06 of the assets and are backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies the 6 million of residential mortgagebacked securities are rated aaa for more information about our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2014 and 2013 including an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities see note 4—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

due to the strong and stable cash flows generated by its insurance products torchmark has the ability to hold securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery even though these fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale torchmark generally expects and intends to hold to maturity any securities which are temporarily impaired 

  

additional information concerning the fixedmaturity portfolio is as follows 

  

fixed maturity portfolio selected information 

  

   

index to financial statements credit risk sensitivity credit risk relates to the level of uncertainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity approximately 87 of our fixedmaturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities including redeemable preferred and assetbacked securities as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities we continually monitor credit risk we mitigate this ongoing risk in part by acquiring only investmentgrade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis we also seek to reduce credit risk by spreading investments over a large number of issuers and a wide range of industry sectors 

  

the following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at december 31 2014 

  

   

at december 31 2014 approximately 24 of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost 25 at fair value were in the financial sector including 14 in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 5 in banks financial guarantors mortgage insurers and insurance brokers comprised approximately 5 of the portfolio at amortized cost after financials the next largest sector was utilities which comprised 17 of the portfolio at amortized cost the balance of the portfolio is spread among 396 issuers in a wide variety of sectors 

  

our energy sector investments accounted for 12 of fixed maturities at amortized cost as of december 31 2014 while this sector has seen recent volatility we believe the risk of losses in the foreseeable future is minimal over 98 of these holdings are investment grade and the portfolio had a net unrealized gain of 151 million at year end 2014 less than 8 of our holdings are in the oil field service and drilling area while there may be some downgrades in this sector we believe that our investments will be able to withstand lower energy prices for an extended duration 

  

index to financial statements an analysis of the fixedmaturity portfolio by a composite rating at december 31 2014 is shown in the table below the composite rating for each security other than privateplacement securities managed by a third party is the average of the security’s ratings as assigned by moody’s investor service standard  poor’s fitch ratings and dominion bond rating service ltd the ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average included in the chart below are private placement fixedmaturity holdings of 497 million at amortized cost 513 million at fair value for which the ratings were assigned by the thirdparty manager

the portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of a based on amortized cost approximately 96 of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by subprime or alta mortgages loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower we have no direct investments in residential mortgages nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts we do not participate in securities lending there are no offbalance sheet investments as all investments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets  other than 9 million of german government bonds at amortized cost and fair value we have no direct exposure to european sovereign debt 

  

our current investment policy regarding fixed maturities is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

an analysis of changes in belowinvestment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost is as follows 

  

   

index to financial statements market risk sensitivity torchmark’s financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since 96 of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixedmaturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixedrate investments the portfolio is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value under normal market conditions we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and generally the intent to hold these investments to maturity the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however as is permitted by gaap these liabilities are not recorded at fair value 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2014 and 2013 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points 

  

   

index to financial statements realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits we also incur acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses generally occur only incidentally usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the periodtoperiod trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

as described in note 4— investments under the caption otherthantemporary impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we wrote certain securities down to fair value during 2012 as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in note 1—significant accounting policies and in our critical accounting policies in this report the writedowns resulted in pretax charges of 56 million in 2012 36 million after tax during 2013 we sold investment real estate for an aftertax loss of 19 million of which 17 million had been written down due to otherthantemporary impairment earlier in the year in 2012 we redeemed our 71 trust originated preferred securities recording a loss on redemption of 41 million 27 million after tax 

  

index to financial statements financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

insurance subsidiary liquidity the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes the funds to provide for policy benefits the majority of which are paid in future periods are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities to meet these longterm obligations in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restriction the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains while the leading source of the excess cash is investment income due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income 

  

parent company liquidity cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt operating expenses of the parent and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders in 2014 the parent received 479 million of cash dividends from its insurance subsidiaries compared with 488 million in 2013 and 437 million in 2012 including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations shareholder dividends and other expenses but before share repurchases torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in 2014 of approximately 377 million compared with 364 million in 2013 parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases in 2015 it is expected that the parent company will receive approximately 473 million in dividends from subsidiaries and that an approximate range of 355 to 365 million will be available as excess cash flow certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 12 — shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company as additional liquidity the parent held 6 million of cash and shortterm investments at december 31 2014 compared with 8 million a year earlier the parent also had available a 50 million receivable from subsidiaries at 2014 year end 

  

shortterm borrowings an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 750 million in july 2014 torchmark replaced a 600 million facility with this new agreement as discussed in note 11 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  under the caption commercial paper  the new facility like the previous is further designated as a backup line of credit for a commercial paper program as of december 31 2014 we had available 314 million of additional borrowing capacity under this new facility compared with 173 million a year earlier there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market during the three years ended december 31 2014 for detailed information about this new line of credit facility please refer to note 11 — debt  

  

in summary torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2015 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of additional debt a shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing 

  

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were 865 million in 2014 compared with 11 billion in 2013 and 943 million in 2012 in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies have received 160 million in investment calls and tenders and 113 million 

  

index to financial statements of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2014 maturities tenders and calls totaled 494 million in 2013 and 737 million in 2012 

  

our cash and shortterm investments were 82 million at yearend 2014 and 114 million at yearend 2013 additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 145 billion at december 31 2014 however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as a part of its abovementioned credit facility torchmark had outstanding 198 million in standby letters of credit at december 31 2014 however these letters are issued among our subsidiaries one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer and have no impact on company obligations as a whole any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of offshore captive reinsurers might require torchmark to obtain thirdparty financing which could cause an immaterial increase in financing costs 

  

as of december 31 2014 we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of thirdparty entities all of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 15 — commitments and contingencies 

  

the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december 31 2014 

  

amounts in millions 

  

  

      

index to financial statements capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in note 11 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements longterm funded debt and shareholders’ equity a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 11  

  

the carrying value of the longterm funded debt was  992 million at december 31 2014 compared with 991 million a year earlier as fully explained in note 11—debt  we issued 300 million principal amount of 38 senior notes due in 2022 in september 2012 for proceeds of 297 million in a public offering however 150 million of the offering was acquired by torchmark insurance subsidiaries and was eliminated in consolidation resulting in net proceeds after issue expenses to the consolidated group of 147 million the majority of the 297 million proceeds received by the parent were used to acquire family heritage as described in note 6—acquisition the balance was invested and later used for the redemption of our 945 million principal amount 7 3  8  notes that matured on august 1 2013 and for other corporate purposes the principal balance of the 7 3  8  notes along with accrued interest was then repaid on its maturity date in the total amount of 975 million 

  

as also discussed in note 11  we issued 125 million principal amount of our 5875 junior subordinated debentures due 2052 in a september 2012 public offering this issue resulted in net proceeds after issue expenses of 121 million and were used to redeem our 71 trust originated preferred securities in the amount of 120 million plus accrued dividends for a total cost of 121 million 

  

also noted in note 11 was our assumption of 20 million of trust preferred securities in connection with our acquisition of family heritage these securities bear interest at a variable rate the threemonth libor plus 330 basis points which is reset each quarter while these securities are callable by us at any time we have no immediate plans to do so 

  

our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 325 of required regulatory capital under riskbased capital rbc a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital the 325 target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows the relatively low risk of their product mix and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark at december 31 2014 our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had rbc ratios of approximately 326 should we experience additional impairments andor ratings downgrades in the future that cause the ratio to fall below 325 management has more than sufficient liquidity at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 325 

  

as noted under the caption summary of operations in this report we have an ongoing share repurchase program under this program we acquired 7 million shares at a cost of 375 million in 2014 8 million shares at a cost of 360 million in 2013 and 11 million shares for 360 million in 2012 the majority of purchased shares are retired each year please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption summary of operations in this report 

  

torchmark has increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years in the first quarter of 2012 it was increased to 10 per share from 08 per share in the first quarter of 2013 it was again raised to 1133 per share then in the first quarter of 2014 dividends were raised to 1267 per share 

  

shareholders’ equity was 47 billion at december 31 2014 compared with 38 billion at december 31 2013 during the twelve months since december 31 2013 shareholders’ equity was reduced by the 375 million in share purchases under the repurchase program and another 74 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises however it was increased by 827 million of aftertax unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio and by the 543 million of net income 

  

we plan to use excess cash available at the parent company as efficiently as possible in the future possible uses of excess cash flow include but are not limited to share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in fixed maturities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies 

  

index to financial statements we maintain a significant availableforsale fixedmaturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets while invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets from time to time the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity because of the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  

  

      

fasb guidance provides for an option which if elected would permit us to value our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets  however unlike the accounting rule which permits us to account for changes in our availableforsale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income the guidance requires such changes to be recorded in earnings because 

  

index to financial statements both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results therefore we have not elected this option 

  

torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 112 times in 2014 compared with 105 times in 2013 and 2012 this timesinterestearned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pretax income from continuing operations and interest expense a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 

  

financial strength ratings the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by standard  poor’s and a m best the following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2014 

  

   

am best states that it assigns an a superior rating to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations companies rated a excellent are considered to have excellent ability to meet those obligations 

  

the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard  poor’s corporation sp to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics differing only slightly from those rated higher an insurer rated a has strong financial security characteristics but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings the plus sign  or minus sign  shows the relative standing within the major rating category 

  

in august 2014 sp updated its outlook on torchmark’s capital position to a negative outlook the revised outlook was due to a change in sp’s view of certain internal components of torchmark’s existing capital position rather than a change in the capital position itself management believes torchmark’s regulatory capital position is currently as strong as it has been for many years and we expect our consolidated rbc ratio to remain at least 325 going forward while we are currently evaluating multiple options to address sp’s comments we do not anticipate any change in our share repurchase program as a result of sp’s action 

  

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries such punitive damage claims may have the potential for significant adverse results since torchmark and its subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

approximately 84 of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2014 were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended december 31 2014 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs eligible for deferral consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note 1 — significant accounting policies under the caption deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements additionally the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies known as the value of insurance purchased is included in deferred acquisition costs our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1  

  

approximately 99 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2014 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2014 

  

the remaining 1 of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31 2014 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate 

  

index to financial statements under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

  

valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to manage risk we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixedmaturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

at times the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixedmaturity investments is presented in note 1—significant accounting policies and in note 4—investments under the captions fair value measurements in both notes 

  

impairment of investments we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value where fair value has declined below carrying value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an otherthantemporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2014 our gross liability under these funded plans was 403 million but was offset by assets of 323 million 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans for example a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the 

  

index to financial statements discount rate and the longterm rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2014 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014 

  

   

    

the company determines mortality assumptions through the use of published mortality tables that reflect broadbased studies of mortality and published longevity improvement scales during 2014 the company revised the mortality assumptions based on an evaluation of a new mortality table and longevity scale released by the society of actuaries the change in these assumptions added approximately 26 million to the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014 

  

the criteria used to determine the primary assumptions are discussed in note 9 — postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to us note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies and other related data

torchmark under the direction of the cochairmen and chief executive officers and the executive vice president and chief financial officer has established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by torchmark in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms the disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to torchmark’s management including the cochairmen and chief executive officers and the executive vice president and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

  

as of the end of the fiscal year completed december 31 2014 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of torchmark management including the cochairmen and chief executive officers and the executive vice president and chief financial officer of torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures as those terms are defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based upon their evaluation the cochairmen and chief executive officers and the executive vice president and chief financial officer have concluded that torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the date of this form 10k in compliance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 18 usc § 1350 each of these officers executed a certification included as an exhibit to this form 10k 

  

as of the quarter ended december 31 2014 there have not been any changes in torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect this control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of their evaluation which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting no material weaknesses in such internal controls were identified in the evaluation and as a consequence no corrective action was required to be taken

index to financial statements management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management at torchmark corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis as a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting the company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls accordingly even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time 

  

management evaluated the company’s internal control over financial reporting and based on its assessment determined that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2014 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of torchmark corporation and subsidiaries torchmark as of december 31 2014 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion torchmark maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2014 of torchmark and our report dated february 27 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses these assumptions are based on company experience and projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

  

index to financial statements underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports pharmacy data doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

index to financial statements risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

medicare part d the medicare part d program is regulated at the federal level by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms this agency periodically examines torchmark’s participating subsidiaries

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a regulated industry populated by many firms we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market the development maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical adequate compensation that is competitive with other career opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical as our competitors seek to hire away our agents from time to time in direct response continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits 

  

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations we serve primarily the middleincome market for individual protection life and health insurance and as a result we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of a significant sustained economic downturn or otherwise then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether 

  

variations in expected to actual rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test expectedtoactual results actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set accordingly we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income 

  

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways including the following limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies 

  

rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could have a negative effect on our operations including limiting our access to capital markets increasing the cost of debt impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries and making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

  

index to financial statements ratings reflect only the rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control in addition rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered the models changes to the models could impact the rating agencies’ judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

reputational risk 

  

damage to the reputation of torchmark or its subsidiaries could affect our ability to conduct business negative publicity published through traditional media internet social media and other public forums could damage our reputation and adversely impact our agent recruiting efforts ability to market our products and the persistency of our block of inforce policies 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

  

our life products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches labor union members and sales via direct response solicitation deterioration of our relationships with organized labor or adverse changes in the public’s receptivity to unsolicited direct response marketing could negatively affect this business 

  

health insurance marketplace risks 

  

the health insurance market is more subject to legislative scrutiny than the life insurance market legislative changes could impact our medicare supplement medicare part d and other supplemental health businesses the nature and timing of any such changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business 

  

competition in the health market can be significant sales of our health insurance products are subject to competition from other health insurance companies and alternative healthcare providers such as those that provide alternatives to traditional medicare to seniors in addition some insurers may be willing to significantly reduce their profit margins or under price new sales in order to gain market share we have chosen not to compete for market share based on these terms accordingly changes in the competitive landscape including the pricing strategies employed by our competitors could negatively impact the future sales of our health insurance products 

  

an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability 

  

investment risks 

  

our investments are subject to market and credit risks our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixedmaturity and shortterm investments a significant portion of our 

  

index to financial statements fixedmaturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels financial market performance disruptions in credit markets and general economic conditions legislative changes particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer and other factors beyond our control additionally because the majority of our investments are longerterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity significant increases in interest rates widening of credit spreads or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable in that case the unrealized loss will be realized at which point we would take an impairment charge reducing our net income 

  

difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses   a default by an issuer could result in a significant otherthantemporary impairment of that investment causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income the risk of default is higher for bonds with longerterm maturities which we acquire in order to match our longterm insurance obligations we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all material otherthantemporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus leading to lower riskbased capital ratios potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries while we intend to hold our investments until maturity a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income 

  

a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

  

liquidity risks 

  

our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available primarily dividends from our insurance subsidiaries as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity for us also include a variety of short and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper longterm debt intercompany financing and reinsurance 

  

index to financial statements the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income excluding capital gains on an annual noncumulative basis or 10 of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval accordingly impairments in invested assets or a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations that reduces their capital or cash flow could limit or disallow payment of dividends to us a principal source of our cash flow 

  

we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries although we do not anticipate changes changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses additionally the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock 

  

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital   should credit spreads widen in the future the interest rate on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility therefore as a result our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders not our investors state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising licensing agents policy forms capital adequacy solvency reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business should these changes to our business occur we may be unable to maintain all 

  

index to financial statements required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations which may change from time to time if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines 

  

we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives in recent years there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries by insurance regulatory authorities which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our agents or employees are improper these actions can result in substantial fines penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may even absent any particular regulatory authority’s interpretation of an issue changing cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to our practices that may in some cases limit our ability to grow impact regulatory capital requirements or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business 

  

currently the us federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance however the doddfrank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 establishes a federal insurance office fio within the department of the treasury and the patient protection and affordable care act affordable care act created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight cciio originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct regulation of the insurance industry we cannot predict what impact if any the fio and cciio as well as any other proposals for federal regulation of insurance could have on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry including the products it offers could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income or negatively effect our ability to sell some of our products 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may affect our financial statements reduce our reported profitability and change the timing of profit recognition our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability 

  

if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material 

  

index to financial statements adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries we are and in the future may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants and in certain of these matters the plaintiffs are seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis however the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states in which we operate juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit 

  

our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases the costs of settlement or judgments against us or changes in our operations that could result from litigation substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation which in turn could materially harm our business and our business prospects 

  

catastrophic event risk 

  

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality caused by events such as a pandemic an act of terrorism or another event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries across a wide geographic area these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and depending on their severity and geographic scope could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

  

the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total number of policyholders in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event pandemics hurricanes earthquakes and manmade catastrophes including terrorism and war may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 

  

information security and technology risk 

  

a network security breach the introduction of malware in our computing environment a disaster or other unanticipated event could affect the computer systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations despite our implementation of cyber security measures to protect our hardware software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access our computing environment could be subject to physical and electronic breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our systems 

  

we retain confidential information in our computer systems anyone who is able to circumvent our cyber security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access view misappropriate alter or delete information in the systems including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information in addition an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of 

  

index to financial statements unauthorized access use or disclosure of their information any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in an inappropriate access use or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter people from purchasing our products subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical legal and other expenses 

  

in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an industrial accident a blackout or a terrorist attack or war our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time even if our employees are able to report to work they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

torchmark and its subsidiaries in common with the insurance industry in general are subject to litigation including claims involving tax matters alleged breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmark’s subsidiaries employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on torchmark’s financial condition future operating results or liquidity however assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forwardlooking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges juries and appellate courts in the future this bespeaks caution particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit 

  

in january 2013 the west virginia treasurer filed actions against torchmark subsidiaries united american globe and american income in the circuit court of putnam county west virginia  state of west virginia ex rel john d perdue v united american insurance company et al  civil action no 12c439 the actions which also name numerous other unaffiliated insurance companies allege violations of the west virginia uniform unclaimed property act and seek to compel compliance with that act through the reporting and remittance of unclaimed life insurance proceeds to the state treasurer as administrator of the west virginia unclaimed property fund this litigation was stayed as to these torchmark subsidiaries pending completion of the unclaimed property audits being conducted by various state departments of revenue discussed more fully below and a motion to dismiss the west virginia litigation was subsequently granted as to all defendants in the case by the court in january 2014 west virginia has filed an appeal of this decision and thus the stay of the litigation against the torchmark subsidiaries has been reinstated 

  

torchmark subsidiaries are currently the subject of audits regarding the identification reporting and escheatment of unclaimed property arising from life insurance policies and a limited number of annuity contracts these audits are being conducted by private entities that have contracted with fortyseven states through their respective departments of revenue and have not resulted in any financial assessment from any state nor indicated any liability the audits are wideranging and seek large amounts of data regarding claims handling procedures and payments of contract benefits arising from unreported death claims amounts that could be payable to insurance beneficiaries and to the states for the escheatment of abandoned property represent insurance liabilities and are included in the company’s estimate of policy benefits under the caption “total policy liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets  no estimate of range can be made for loss contingencies related to possible administrative penalties at this time

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

acquisition on november 1 2012 we acquired family heritage a previously privatelyheld supplemental health insurance carrier information about this acquisition can be found in note 6—acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the results of family heritage subsequent to our acquisition are included in this discussion within our health insurance segment 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and to a limited extent annuities to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully described in note 14 — business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and the administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations net income was 528 million in 2013 compared with 529 million in 2012 net income increased 6 in 2012 from 497 million in 2011 on a diluted per share basis 2013 net income rose 5 to 568 after a 19 increase in 2012 net income per diluted share in 2012 rose to 541 from 453 in 2011 the pershare results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program also each year’s per share net income was affected by realized investment gains which were 04 025 and 015 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively more information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses in this report where there is a more complete discussion also as explained in note 14—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments additionally we do not consider nonoperating items which are not related to the current ongoing reporting performance of our segments as indicated in the chart above to be part of our segment operating income 

  

as shown in the above chart aftertax segment results of operations rose each year over the prior year from 494 million in 2011 to 507 million in 2012 to 531 million in 2013 the primary contributor to the growth in both 2013 and 2012 was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment in which margins rose 36 million in 2013 and 49 million in 2012 the life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented also contributing to growth in income in both years was our health insurance segment which provided 34 million of additional margin in 2013 and 8 million in 2012 the 2013 increase in health margin was primarily due to the inclusion of family heritage’s health business for a full year since its acquisition in late 2012 family heritage accounted for 32 million of the increase in 2013 margin the 2012 improvement was largely due to the increased volume in our medicare part d program both of the years 2013 and 2012 have been negatively impacted by declines in excess investment income the measure of profitability of our investment segment these declines in excess investment income have resulted from the continuing low interest rate environment which has pressured investment yields and spreads related to required interest on net policy liabilities discussed more fully under the caption investments in this report especially in 2012 the impact of the lower interestrate environment increased as an unusual number of calls resulting 

  

index to financial statements from a new regulation affecting bank hybrid securities caused us to replace these higher yielding securities with securities at lower yields the inclusion of family heritage’s administrative expenses for a full year for the first time added 8 million of additional administrative expense in 2013 in addition in both 2013 and 2012 there were increases in stock compensation expense which negatively affected the results during the year stock compensation increased 4 million in 2013 and 7 million in 2012 these increases in stock compensation expense resulted primarily from the increase in the value of torchmark’s stock and not from an increase in the number of grants 

  

total revenues rose 5 in 2013 to 377 billion after having risen 6 in 2012 to 359 billion life premium rose 4 or 77 million in 2013 to 189 billion life premium increased 82 million in 2012 to 181 billion net investment income was essentially flat at 694 million in 2012 but rose 2 or 16 million in 2013 health premium increased 11 to 117 billion in 2013 and contributed 119 million to 2013 revenue growth after having gained 13 to 105 billion in 2012 health premium contributed 117 million to 2012 revenue growth 

  

while life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december 31 2013 margins as a percentage of premium have risen even more rising in 2013 to 29 from 28 in 2012 and 27 in 2011 segment profits for life insurance were not only positively affected by the premium growth but also by improvements in persistency in both periods and reductions in nondeferred acquisition costs life net sales declined 1 in 2013 to 339 million but increased 6 in 2012 to 343 million life insurance segment results are discussed further in this report under the caption life insurance 

  

with regard to health insurance we primarily market medicare supplement insurance medicare part d prescription drug insurance other limitedbenefit products including cancer and accident and health products as noted above 2013 health premium was positively affected by the inclusion of family heritage’s health premium for a full year the 13 increase in 2012 health premium was a result of the addition of a large number of new lowincome medicare part d autoenrollees in the 2012 plan year the inclusion of family heritage also caused our limitedbenefit health premium which is their primary focus to exceed our medicare supplement premium in 2013 for the first time in several years prior to 2013 medicare supplement was our largest contributor to total health premium limitedbenefit health premium was 447 million in 2013 increasing 50 over 2012 limitedbenefit health premium of 298 million this increase was a result of the inclusion of family heritage’s business medicare supplement premium was 417 million in 2013 but has declined slightly in each successive year from 2011 as lapses have exceeded new sales our medicare part d premium declined 6 in 2013 to 300 million after having risen 62 to 318 million in 2012 the 2012 increase was a result of the previouslynoted addition of lowincome autoenrollees in the 2012 plan due to increased competition in the 2013 plan year we experienced a decrease in 2013 part d premium for the 2014 part d plan year we were able to qualify for new autoenrollees in 15 regions compared with 7 in 2013 as a result we expect growth in part d sales and premium in 2014 see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

  

we do not currently offer annuities see the caption annuities for discussion of the annuity segment 

  

as previously mentioned the investment segment’s pretax profitability or excess investment income declined in both 2013 and 2012 profitability in this segment is based on three major components net investment income required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to insurance products and financing costs in recent years net investment income has not grown as fast as the portfolio one reason that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of also there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested during which the funds are held in cash growth in total investment income is also somewhat negatively affected by torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments in 2013 net investment income rose 2 3 as in accordance with our segment analysis while the portfolio at amortized cost grew 9 

  

index to financial statements the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets the lower newmoney yields resulting from the lowinterestrate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow at approximately the same rate that net policy liabilities have grown we have implemented certain strategies to offset this effect including increasing premium rates on sales of new products as discussed under the caption investments  financing costs which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and shortterm debt are also deducted from net investment income financing costs in 2013 were stable at 80 million but increased 3 in 2012 the 2012 increase was primarily a result of two new debt offerings issued in the latter half of 2012 as described below 

  

torchmark’s current investment policy regarding fixed maturities limits new fixed maturity acquisitions to investmentgrade securities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives approximately 96 of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which 96 were investment grade at december 31 2013 the average quality rating of the portfolio was a the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alta mortgages no direct investment in residential mortgages no counterparty risks no credit default swaps or other derivative contracts see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and n ote 4—investments in the notes to consolidated statements of operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment 

  

as noted earlier we issued two new debt offerings during 2012 our 300 million principal amount 38 senior notes due 2022 and our 125 million principal amount 5875 junior subordinated debentures due 2052 both issued in september proceeds from the senior notes were 297 million but 150 million were purchased by our insurance subsidiaries and were eliminated in consolidation proceeds from this offering provided funding for the retirement of our 7 3  8  senior notes which matured and were repaid in august 2013 and for the acquisition of family heritage in november 2012 the 121 million net proceeds from the subordinated debentures were used to fund the call of our 120 million principal amount 71 trust originated preferred securities in october 2012 more information on these transactions can be found in note 6—acquisition and note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 

  

in each of the years 2011 through 2013 net income was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring nonoperating items we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations as reported in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption settlements  we were involved in certain issues in which we incurred settlement losses and expenses in 2011 we settled a state administrative matter in the pretax amount of 69 million 45 million after tax and accrued an estimated liability for a litigation amount which settled in early 2012 in the pretax amount of 120 million 78 million after tax both of these issues involved matters arising many years ago additionally in connection with the 2012 purchase of family heritage as described in note 6 —acquisition  we incurred 29 million of acquisitionrelated expenses 19 million after tax during 2013 torchmark incurred a state guaranty fund assessment in the amount of 12 million 751 thousand after tax resulting from events in years prior to 2012 also in 2013 we resolved a legal matter related to a noninsurance issue in the amount of 500 thousand 325 thousand after tax and settled additional litigation related to prior years in the amount of 86 million 56 million after tax all of these items have been expensed in the consolidated statements of operations  however as described in note 1  we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are nonoperating items when evaluating the results of current operations and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods 

  

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises the board of directors has authorized the company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management in consultation with the board determines to be in the best interest of the

option proceeds were unusually high in 2011 and 2012 due to option holders exercising several years of option grants that expired in 2012

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows the following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations as described in note 14—business segments  

  

life insurance life insurance is our largest insurance segment with 2013 life premium representing 62 of total premium life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 70 of the total in 2013 additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

life insurance premium rose 4 to 189 billion in 2013 after having increased 5 in 2012 to 181 billion life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue net sales is annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

  

index to financial statements annualized life premium in force was 196 billion at december 31 2013 an increase of 3 over 190 billion a year earlier annualized life premium in force was 181 billion at december 31 2011

the american income exclusive agency has historically focused primarily on marketing to members of labor unions while the labor union market is still the backbone of american income’s business the agency has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help to ensure sustainable growth it is torchmark’s highest margin business the american income agency was also the largest contributor to life premium and net sales of any torchmark distribution method in 2013 life premium for this agency rose 8 to 715 million after having risen 9 in 2012 net sales declined 4 in 2013 to 153 million after having risen 12 in 2012 net sales rose 3 in 2011 the average face amount of policies issued in 2013 was approximately 33 thousand as is the case with all of torchmark’s agency distribution systems continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count the american income agent count was 5302 at december 31 2013 compared with 5176 a year earlier an increase of 2 the agent count increased 18 in 2012 and 12 in 2011 management’s primary objective is to grow middle management in the agency to help ensure sustainable growth this is being achieved through an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train personnel we have also begun providing more homeoffice and webinar training programs these programs are designed to provide each agent from new recruits to top level managers coaching and instruction specifically designed for each individual’s level of experience and responsibilities this agency has recently opened new offices in territories where there are existing offices but where there is an excess capacity of leads we believe that these initiatives will promote increased enthusiasm in the field and will drive increases in agent retention and sales activity 

  

index to financial statements the direct response unit targets its market through a variety of directtoconsumer approaches which include direct mailings insert media internet and inbound telephone calls these different approaches support and complement one another in the unit’s efforts to reach the consumer the direct response unit’s growth has been fueled by constant innovation in recent years the internet and inbound call center production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased internet marketing activities and focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center we have also introduced certain new initiatives to increase response rates in this unit from which we have seen positive results these initiatives include lower premium rates as well as offerings of higher face amounts on the adult products 

  

direct response focuses primarily on young middleincome households with children the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product for this unit not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales it is also a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders also both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time at this time we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response’s premier markets 

  

the direct response operation accounted for 35 of our life insurance premium during 2013 increasing 5 over 2012 premium life premium for this unit rose 6 in 2012 and 5 in 2011 net sales rose 2 to 144 million in 2013 after a 3 increase in 2012 firstyear collected premium was flat at 93 million after an increase of 5 in 2012 the average face amount of policies issued in 2013 was approximately 16 thousand 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency markets primarily life insurance and supplemental health insurance focusing on middleincome customers life premium income for this agency was 276 million in 2013 a 2 decrease compared with 282 million in 2012 life premium also declined 2 in 2012 from 2011 first year collected premium declined 4 in 2013 after having declined 15 in 2012 the average face amount of life policies issued in 2013 was approximately 22 thousand 

  

the liberty national agency’s net sales declined 4 to 31 million in 2013 after having declined 11 a year earlier as is the case with all of our agencies sales are driven by the size of the agent force the liberty agency had 1430 producing agents at december 31 2013 compared with 1419 a year earlier an increase of 1 the producing agent count increased 6 during 2012 

  

the recent declines in premium and sales were due primarily to changes in the structure of the agency that have affected agent counts in recent years several years ago management began a process to convert the agency from a fixed expense salarybased agency model to a commissiondriven variablecost model even though we expected the conversion would result in agent defections the change was necessary to maintain acceptable underwriting margins on new business and to ensure the longterm survival and growth of this distribution channel we have implemented these changes gradually in an effort to minimize agency disruption as much as possible 

  

liberty has historically focused its marketing efforts in smaller rural areas in the southeastern united states going forward management expects to grow this agency through nationwide geographic expansion into more urban areas where there are larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers we believe that expansion of this agency’s presence into more heavily populated less penetrated areas will help reverse the declines in agent count and create long term agency growth as a result 6 new offices were opened in larger metropolitan areas during 2013 and we expect to open an additional 5 offices in 2014 as agents in these offices become more experienced their productivity should improve we have also implemented a new prospecting training program designed to improve the ability of our agents to develop new worksite marketing business 

  

index to financial statements we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the military agency the united american independent agency and other small sales agencies the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who sell primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of wholelife products with term insurance riders military premium represented 10 of life premium at december 31 2013 the united american independent agency represented approximately 1 of torchmark’s total life premium at that date as their sales of torchmark products consist primarily of health insurance

gross margins as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense rose 7 in 2013 and 11 in 2012 the margin increased to 545 million in 2013 after rising to 509 million in 2012 margin growth in all periods was primarily the result of premium growth as a percentage of life insurance premium the margins have risen steadily each year largely due to improved persistency in 2013 these increases were positively affected by our conservation program and permitted increases in the deferrals of our internetrelated direct response acquisition costs 

  

index to financial statements health insurance health insurance sold by torchmark includes primarily medicare supplement and part d prescription drug coverage to enrollees in the federal medicare program cancer coverage accident coverage and other limitedbenefit supplemental health products all health coverage plans other than medicare supplement and part d are classified here as limitedbenefit plans 

  

total health premium represented 38 of torchmark’s total premium income in 2013 excluding part d premium health premium represented 28 of total premium income in 2013 compared with 26 in 2012 and 28 in 2011 health underwriting margin excluding part d accounted for 25 of the total in 2013 compared with 23 in 2012 and 25 in 2011 health results in 2013 were positively affected by the late 2012 addition of family heritage family heritage added 191 million of health premium in 2013 compared with 30 million in 2012 however health results have been negatively affected by the discontinuance of sales and the runoff of a block of hospitalsurgical limitedbenefit products which became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments these products were also our highestpremium lowestmargin products health results have also been negatively affected by the restructuring of the liberty national agency as discussed under the caption life insurance  the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years

health insurance excluding medicare part d health premium excluding part d premium rose 18 to 864 million in 2013 after having declined 1 in 2012 to 730 million and a decline of 6 in 2011 however if the premium of family heritage were removed for comparability in 2013 and 2012 health premium excluding part d would have declined 4 in 2013 and 5 in 2012 the declines in premium resulted primarily from the previouslymentioned runoff of a block of discontinued hospitalsurgical plans net sales increased 42 in 2013 to 111 million after having increased 22 in 2012 these increases were primarily a result of the acquisition of family heritage which contributed 44 million to the growth in 2013 and 7 million of the 14 million increase in 2012 net sales declined 1 in 2011 firstyear collected premium increased 47 in 2013 and 17 in 2012 after a 22 decline in 2011 family heritage accounted for the majority of the increases in both 2013 and 2012 

  

index to financial statements the addition of family heritage’s sales and premium from limitedbenefit products has resulted in limitedbenefit health premium exceeding medicare supplement premium income in 2013 for the first time in several years limitedbenefit premium represented 52 of total nonpart d health premium in 2013 but represented 41 in 2012 and 40 in 2011 prior to our acquisition of family heritage medicare supplement provided the greatest amount of health premium family heritage also added a boost to limitedbenefit net sales in relation to medicare supplement net sales as they rose to 60 of total nonpart d net sales in 2013 from 41 in both 2012 and 2011 

  

we do not expect recent health care reform activity to have a significant impact on our operations we don’t sell any products subject to the affordable care act and don’t believe that consumer demand for the types of supplemental health products we sell will be diminished while we will be subject to certain federal taxes on a small portion of our existing health business going forward we don’t expect the amount of these taxes to be material 

  

the ua independent agency is torchmark’s largest in terms of health premium income producing 35 of health premium in 2013 this agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large multistate organizations down to oneperson offices all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies torchmark had 2414 active producing agents at december 31 2013 compared with 2003 a year earlier this agency is our largest producer of medicare supplement insurance with 274 million or 66 of our medicare supplement premium income in 2013 net sales for this agency were 41 million in 2013 a decline of 2 from 2012 net sales of 42 million in 2012 they had increased 29 over 2011 net sales total health premium income for the ua independent agency was 298 million in 2013 a slight decline from 2012 premium of 299 million premium income also declined 3 in 2012 these declines in premium have resulted due to lapses of limitedbenefit products being greater than new sales 

  

the family heritage exclusive agency was acquired by torchmark’s acquisition of family heritage on november 1 2012 as discussed in note 6—acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements  this agency markets primarily limitedbenefit supplemental health insurance in nonurban areas most of their policies include a cashback feature such as a returnofpremium whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy the family heritage agency is our largest agency in terms of health net sales adding 44 million in net sales in 2013 this agency’s 191 million in health premium income during 2013 represented 22 of torchmark’s total excluding part d the producing agent count was 695 agents at december 31 2013 compared with 702 agents at december 31 2012 management expects to grow this agency going forward through geographic expansion and incorporation of torchmark’s recruiting programs annualized health premium in force at december 31 2013 was 201 million compared with 188 million a year earlier 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency represented 28 of all torchmark nonpart d health premium income at 241 million in 2013 the liberty agency markets limitedbenefit health supplemental products consisting primarily of cancer insurance much of the liberty’s health business is now generated through worksite marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees in 2013 health premium income in the agency declined 8 from prior year premium of 264 million after declining 9 in 2012 as noted earlier these premium declines were due primarily to the runoff of a block of discontinued hospitalsurgical business as well as the previouslydiscussed restructuring of this agency to a commissiondriven model 

  

the american income exclusive agency predominantly a life insurance distribution channel was our fourth largest health insurance distributor based on premium income in 2013 its health plans are comprised of various limitedbenefit plans approximately 69 of the agency’s 2013 health premium was from accident policies sales of the plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 

  

health premium at this agency declined slightly in 2013 to 79 million from 80 million however health net sales declined in both periods falling 20 in 2013 to 7 million and declining 9 to 9 million in 2012 because this agency focuses on life products health net sales comprised only 4 of the american income agency’s total net sales in 2013 

  

index to financial statements direct response  primarily a life operation also offers health insurance which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups in 2013 net health sales were 4 million compared with 5 million in 2012 and 2011 in 2013 health net sales for this group represented approximately 3 of direct response’s total life and health net sales direct response health premium income was 54 million in 2013 a decline of 7 over 2012 premium of 58 million health premium rose 2 in 2012 

  

medicare part d torchmark through its subsidiary united american offers coverage under the government’s medicare part d plan the medicare part d plan is a standalone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american under part d private carriers are the primary insurers while cms provides significant premium subsidies and reinsurance our medicare part d product is sold through the direct response operation and to groups through the ua independent agency 

  

part d net sales were 79 million in 2013 compared with 114 million in 2012 and 115 million in 2011 we count only sales to new firsttime enrollees in net sales and the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees total medicare part d premium was 300 million in 2013 compared with 318 million in 2012 and 197 million in 2011 total enrollees in the program were 254 thousand at the beginning of the 2013 plan year 215 thousand at the beginning of the 2012 plan year and 144 thousand at the beginning of the 2011 plan year 

  

changes in part d premium generally result from changes in the number of enrollees which are heavily influenced by new sales in 2011 united american had only one part d product and was not active in the lowincome autoenrollee market in 2012 the company added a new lower cost part d plan which allowed us to pick up a large number of lowincome autoenrollees in 21 regions and to grow our own individual sales in 2013 due to intensified price competition we qualified for new autoenrollees in only 7 regions but were able to keep prior year autoenrollees in 14 regions and maintain our presence in 21 regions these variations in the number of new autoenrollees caused the changes in part d net sales premium and enrollee counts including the large increases in 2012 and the slight decline in premium in 2013 the 2013 decline was also influenced by the loss of several employer group part d cases at the end of 2012 

  

for the plan year 2014 torchmark qualified to receive new part d autoenrollees in 15 regions and also qualified to retain prior year autoenrollees in 8 regions for a total of 23 regions total enrollees in the program were 269 thousand at the beginning of the 2014 plan year this increase in the number of regions and enrollees should result in an increase in part d premium to approximately 340 million in 2014 

  

we participate in the medicare part d program because of our experience with the seniorage market and with medicare supplements the government assurances with regard to the risksharing agreements for participating insurers limitedrisk due to the incremental income added to our health insurance margins and the renewal of the business every year due to our experience with service to the seniorage market and the use of our existing direct response marketing system entry to this business required little new investment however as with any governmentsponsored program the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market 

  

index to financial statements as presented in the following table torchmark’s health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense increased 17 to 232 million in 2013 after an increase of 4 to 197 million in 2012 family heritage contributed 32 million of the 34 million 2013 increase as a percentage of premium income margins were 20 in both 2013 and 2011 as compared with 19 in 2012 the lower 2012 percentage reflected the greater proportion of medicare part d business which had a higher benefit ratio

index to financial statements annuities our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2013 2012 and 2011 were 138 billion 135 billion and 129 billion respectively underwriting income was 39 million 35 million and 23 million in each of the respective years 

  

while the fixed annuity account balance has increased modestly each year over the prior year and underwriting income has increased each year as well policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year the majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are not based on account size a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements which can result in negative net policy obligations in 2012 however spreads tended to level as crediting rates reached guaranteed minimums 

  

we do not currently market annuity products favoring instead protectionoriented life and health insurance products therefore we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward 

  

administrative expenses operating expenses are included in the other and corporate segments and are classified into two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company the following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2013

index to financial statements insurance administrative expenses rose 8 in 2013 after having increased 4 in 2012 as a percentage of premium they increased 1 in 2013 to 59 but declined 2 in 2012 to 58 the inclusion of family heritage’s administrative expenses accounted for 81 million of the 135 million increase in total administrative expense in 2013 the 2012 increase in total insurance administrative expense of 63 million was primarily the result of the expiration of a third party agreement under which we were reimbursed a net of 52 million in 2011 for providing policy administration services and 16 million from the addition of family heritage’s expenses in 2012 stock compensation expense has risen in each successive year as the value of torchmark stock has increased resulting in higher values for grants of stock and options and not because of an increase in the number of grants as stated in note 14—business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 

  

during 2013 torchmark recorded two nonoperating charges 1 a state guaranty fund assessment in the amount of 12 million 751 thousand after tax resulting from events in years prior to 2012 and 2 a legal settlement related to a noninsurance matter in the amount of 500 thousand 325 thousand after tax we incurred expenses of 29 million related to the acquisition of family heritage in late 2012 as described in note 6— acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements  additionally as mentioned in note 1— significant accounting policies  we incurred two settlement expense issues in 2011 that related to events occurring many years ago the settlement of a state administrative issue of 7 million and a litigation issue in the estimated amount of 12 million the latter item was settled in that amount in 2012 in addition to these two 2011 items we sold aviation equipment in 2011 at a loss of 979 thousand while all of these nonrecurring expenses were included in “operating expenses” for the respective year in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with accounting guidance they are considered as nonoperating expenses by management 

  

investments we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14— business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used over 57 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

index to financial statements excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  

  

     

excess investment income declined 18 million or 8 in 2013 from the prior year excess investment income declined 22 million or 9 in 2012 excess investment income has been pressured over the past three years as a result of the impact of lower interest rates on net investment income coupled with the increase in required interest on net policy liabilities discussed later under this caption on a per diluted share basis excess investment income declined by 3 to 235 in 2013 excess investment income rose 3 to 242 per share in 2012 after having risen 10 in the prior year the smaller decline in 2013 pershare amounts as well as the more favorable increases in 2012 and 2011 relative to the changes in dollar amounts for excess investment income are a result of share repurchases 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income as adjusted for the segment analysis which rose 3 to 735 million in 2013 it increased 1 to 716 million in 2012 from 707 million in 2011 the inclusion of family heritage acquired in late 2012 added 21 million of net investment income in 2013 compared with 3 million in 2012 accounting for the majority of the 2013 increase however growth in net investment income has generally been slower than growth in mean invested assets in recent years due to the declining interest rate environment in 2013 fixed maturity yields averaged 594 on a taxequivalent and effectiveyield basis compared with 635 in 2012 and 656 in 2011 even though mean invested assets have increased each period net investment income has grown at a slower pace as a result of the decline in average yields in a declining rate environment the overall portfolio yield will decrease as new money is invested at lower prevailing yields the reduction in the average yields was primarily a result of reinvesting proceeds from bonds that matured or were called at yield rates less than the rates we earned on the bonds before they matured or were called while family heritage added incrementally to net investment income during 2013 its loweryielding portfolio also contributed to the decline in the average fixedmaturity yield 

  

index to financial statements presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets 

  

   

approximately 62 of the invested assets added in 2011 through 2013 replaced higheryielding assets that matured were called or were otherwise disposed of during that period a major factor negatively affecting net investment income was calls of fixedmaturity securities during 2012 and to a lesser extent in 2013 we had an unusually large number of these calls including 129 million of bankissued hybrid securities in 2013 and 339 million in 2012 fixed maturity securities are more likely to be called in a declining interestrate environment as these callable securities can often be refinanced at lower prevailing rates in addition to bonds with scheduled call dates our portfolio includes bankissued hybrid securities with provisions allowing the security to be called in the event of a change in capital treatment many banks chose to call their hybrid securities because the doddfrank act phased out the partial equity credit historically allowed for these securities of our 12 billion fixed maturity portfolio at amortized cost as of december 31 2013 we held 134 million book value of bank hybrid securities with a weighted average yield of 687 that were callable without a makewhole provision and 175 million of other fixed maturity securities with a weighted average yield of 585 that were callable solely at the discretion of the issuer but that had not been called as of december 31 2013 in addition we also held 186 million book value of nonbank hybrid securities with a weighted average yield of 631 that become callable solely at the discretion of the issuer on various scheduled dates during the next three years many factors can be involved in an issuer’s decision to call a bond therefore it is difficult to predict whether or not a bond will be called in the future and if so when it will be called if these bonds were to be called there would be a reduction in future net investment income if the average yield on called securities exceeds prevailing new money rates approximately 66 of the callable bank hybrid securities at december 31 2013 were rated belowinvestmentgrade if called both the ratio of belowinvestmentgrade securities to our investment portfolio and statutory required capital would also decrease 

  

in addition to the aforementioned calls we had more sales of investments than usual particularly in 2011 and 2012 from which proceeds were reinvested at lower yields these sales were generally made due to credit concerns or for tax purposes 

  

excess investment income is reduced by the required interest on net insurance policy liabilities because we consider these amounts to be components of the profitability of our insurance segments required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force the great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interestrate protection policies not investment products and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for longduration insurance products formerly sfas 60 now incorporated into asc 9442005 this guidance mandates that interest rate assumptions be “locked in” for the life of that block of business each calendar year we set the assumed discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on the premiums received in the future from policies of that issue year and cannot be changed except in the event of a premium deficiency the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in as such the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years changes in the overall weightedaverage discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business 

  

because actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weightedaverage discount rate of our in force block we don’t expect an extended lowinterestrate environment to cause a loss recognition event 

  

index to financial statements information about interest on policy liabilities is shown in the following table

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

the combined weighted average discount rate decreased in 2013 due to the inclusion of family heritage for a full year increases in the weighted average discount rate in 2012 and 2011 are due to changes in the mix of the inforce business discussed above 

  

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income 

  

index to financial statements the table below presents the components of financing costs and reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations 

  

analysis of financing costs 

amounts in thousands 

  

  

   

financing costs increased 163 thousand or 2 in 2013 they rose 3 million or 3 in 2012 the increase in financing costs in 2012 over 2011 reflects the increased interest expense from the issuance in september 2012 of 300 million principal amount of our 38 senior notes due in 2022 150 million of which is eliminated in consolidation also in september 2012 we issued our 5875 junior subordinated debentures due 2052 for 125 million principal amount but called our 120 million 71 trust preferred securities one month later in august 2013 we repaid our 7375 notes that matured these debt transactions will decrease interest expense on our longterm funded debt going forward in 2013 interest on shortterm debt declined primarily because of the reduction in the average balance outstanding of shortterm debt the 2011 and 2012 increases in interest on shortterm debt were primarily a result of the 21 million increase in financing charges on our letter of credit facility arising from the december 2010 restructuring of our credit facility more information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the financial condition section of this report and in note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

as previously noted growth rates in our excess investment income decline when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs such as we have experienced in recent periods in an extended lowinterestrate environment the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower longterm rates we believe however the decline would be relatively slow as on average only 2 to 3 of fixed maturities are expected to run off each year over the next five years 

  

in response to the lower interest rates we raised the premium rates for new business on major life products in early 2012 and again in late 2013 the increased premium provides additional margin on these policies to help offset higher mandatory cash values and the possible future reductions in excess investment income these increases in premium have not had a detrimental impact on sales 

  

the year 2013 was the third consecutive year that excess investment income declined however going forward we expect this downward trend to reverse we look for increases in excess investment income and income per share in the near future as rate declines have moderated the majority of hybrid calls are behind us and expected maturities will have lower yields than those in the past 

  

excess investment income benefits from increases in longterm rates available on new investments and decreases in shortterm borrowing rates of these two factors higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at shortterm rates therefore torchmark would benefit if rates especially longterm rates were to rise 

  

index to financial statements investment acquisitions  torchmark’s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investmentgrade fixed maturities generally with long maturities maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date that meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities further we believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable if such longerterm securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives we consider investing in shortterm securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time during calendar years 2011 through 2013 torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities primarily with longerterm maturities as presented in the chart below 

  

the following table summarizes selected information for fixedmaturity purchases the effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield this date is commonly known as the “worst call date” two different average life calculations are shown average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date

we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments cannot be known at the time of the investment however the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 

  

during the three years 2011 through 2013 we have invested almost entirely in investmentgrade corporate bonds acquisitions in 2012 and 2013 have been primarily in industrial and utility bonds new cash flow available for investment has been primarily provided through our insurance operations but has also been affected by other factors issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past three years were an important factor especially in 2012 calls increase funds available for investment but as noted earlier in this discussion they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called issuer calls were 344 million in 2013 650 million in 2012 and 187 million in 2011 the higher level of acquisitions in 2012 was primarily due to the additional funds available from the higher level of 2012 calls 

  

index to financial statements portfolio analysis because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms the following table presents a comparison of torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2013 with the latest industry data 

  

   

because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities an analysis of our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 is as follows

at december 31 2013 fixed maturities had a fair value of 129 billion compared with 135 billion at december 31 2012 at december 31 2013 fixed maturities were in a 390 million net unrealized gain position compared with an unrealized gain position of 16 billion at december 31 2012 approximately 81 of our fixed maturity assets at december 31 2013 at amortized cost were corporate bonds and 4 were redeemable preferred stocks this compares with 78 corporate bonds and 6 redeemable preferred stocks at year end 2012 on a combined basis residential mortgagebacked securities other assetbacked securities and collateralized debt obligations cdos were 1 of the assets at amortized cost at december 31 2013 the 66 million of cdos at amortized cost made up less than 06 of the assets and are backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies the 8 million of residential mortgagebacked securities are rated aaa for more information about our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2013 and 2012 including an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities see note 4—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

due to the strong and stable cash flows generated by its insurance products torchmark has the ability to hold securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery even though these fixed maturity investments are available for sale torchmark generally expects and intends to hold to maturity any securities which are temporarily impaired 

  

additional information concerning the fixedmaturity portfolio is as follows

index to financial statements credit risk sensitivity credit risk relates to the level of uncertainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity approximately 86 of our fixedmaturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities including redeemable preferred and assetbacked securities as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities we continually monitor credit risk we mitigate this ongoing risk in part by acquiring only investmentgrade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis we also seek to reduce credit risk by spreading investments over a large number of issuers and a wide range of industry sectors 

  

the following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at december 31 2013 

  

   

at december 31 2013 approximately 25 of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost 26 at fair value were in the financial sector including 14 in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 6 in banks financial guarantors mortgage insurers and insurance brokers comprised approximately 5 of the portfolio at amortized cost after financials the next largest sector was utilities which comprised 18 of the portfolio at amortized cost the balance of the portfolio is spread among 399 issuers in a wide variety of sectors 

  

index to financial statements an analysis of the fixedmaturity portfolio by a composite rating at december 31 2013 is shown in the table below the composite rating for each security other than privateplacement securities managed by a third party is the average of the security’s ratings as assigned by moody’s investor service standard  poor’s fitch ratings and dominion bond rating service ltd the ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average included in the chart below are private placement fixedmaturity holdings of 313 million at amortized cost 300 million at fair value for which the ratings were assigned by the thirdparty manager

the portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of a based on amortized cost approximately 95 of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by subprime or alta mortgages loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower we have no direct investments in residential mortgages nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts we do not participate in securities lending there are no offbalance sheet investments as all investments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets  other than 11 million of german government bonds at amortized cost and fair value we have no direct exposure to european sovereign debt 

  

our current investment policy regarding fixed maturities is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

an analysis of changes in belowinvestment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost is as follows 

  

   

  

index to financial statements market risk sensitivity torchmark’s financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since 96 of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixedmaturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixedrate investments the portfolio is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value under normal market conditions we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and generally the intent to hold these investments to maturity the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however as is permitted by gaap these liabilities are not recorded at fair value 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2013 and 2012 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points 

  

   

index to financial statements realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits we also incur acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses generally occur only incidentally usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the periodtoperiod trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results 

  

the following table summarizes our taxeffected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2013

as described in note 4— investments under the caption otherthantemporary impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we wrote certain securities down to fair value during 2012 and 2011 as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in note 1—significant accounting policies and in our critical accounting policies in this report the writedowns resulted in pretax charges of 56 million in 2012 36 million after tax and 20 thousand in 2011 13 thousand after tax during 2013 we sold investment real estate for an aftertax loss of 19 million of which 17 million had been written down due to otherthantemporary impairment earlier in the year in 2012 we redeemed our 71 trust originated preferred securities recording a loss on redemption of 41 million 27 million after tax 

  

index to financial statements financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

insurance subsidiary liquidity the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes the funds to provide for policy benefits the majority of which are paid in future periods are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities to meet these longterm obligations in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restriction the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains while the leading source of the excess cash is investment income due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control a significant portion of the excess cash also comes from underwriting income 

  

parent company liquidity cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt operating expenses of the parent and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders in 2013 the parent received 488 million of cash dividends from its insurance subsidiaries as compared with 437 million in 2012 and 769 million in 2011 the 2011 dividend included 305 million of additional dividends available as a result of the sale of united investors including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations shareholder dividends and other expenses but before share repurchases torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in 2013 of approximately 364 million compared with 371 million in 2012 parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases in 2014 it is expected that the parent company will receive approximately 475 million in dividends from subsidiaries and that an approximate range of 370 to 380 million will be available as excess cash flow certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 12 — shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company as additional liquidity the parent held 8 million of cash and shortterm investments at december 31 2013 compared with 2 million a year earlier the parent also had available a 50 million receivable from subsidiaries at december 31 2013 

  

shortterm borrowings an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 600 million as of december 31 2013 we had available 173 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility compared with 177 million a year earlier there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market under this facility during the three years ended december 31 2013 for detailed information about this line of credit facility see the commercial paper section of note 11 — debt  

  

in summary torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2014 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of additional debt a shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing 

  

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were 11 billion in 2013 compared with 943 million in 2012 and 859 million in 2011 in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies have received 369 million in investment calls and tenders and 125 million of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2013 maturities tenders and calls totaled 737 million in 2012 and 410 million in 2011 

  

index to financial statements our cash and shortterm investments were 114 million at yearend 2013 and 157 million at yearend 2012 additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 129 billion at december 31 2013 however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as described in note 11 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt torchmark had outstanding 120 million par amount 71 trust preferred securities at december 31 2011 but these securities were redeemed during 2012 the capital trust liable for these securities was the legal entity responsible for the securities and facilitated the payment of dividends to shareholders the trust was an offbalance sheet arrangement which we were required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules because the capital trust was considered to be a variable interest entity in which we had no variable interest while these liabilities were not on our consolidated balance sheets  they were represented by torchmark’s 71 junior subordinated debentures due to the trust in the amount of 124 million the redemption of these debentures funded the redemption of the trust preferreds 

  

as a part of its abovementioned credit facility torchmark had outstanding 198 million in standby letters of credit at december 31 2013 however these letters are issued among our subsidiaries one of which is an offshore captive reinsurer and have no impact on company obligations as a whole any future regulatory changes that restrict the use of offshore captive reinsurers might require torchmark to obtain thirdparty financing which could cause an immaterial increase in financing costs 

  

as of december 31 2013 we had no unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of thirdparty entities all of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 15 — commitments and contingencies 

  

the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december 31 2013 

  

amounts in millions 

  

  

      

index to financial statements capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in note 11 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements longterm funded debt and shareholders’ equity a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 11  

  

the carrying value of the longterm funded debt was  991 million at december 31 2013 compared with 990 million a year earlier as fully explained in note 11—debt  we issued 300 million principal amount of 38 senior notes due in 2022 in september 2012 for proceeds of 297 million in a public offering however 150 million of the offering was acquired by torchmark insurance subsidiaries and was eliminated in consolidation resulting in net proceeds after issue expenses to the consolidated group of 147 million the majority of the 297 million proceeds received by the parent were used to acquire family heritage as described in note 6—acquisition the balance was invested and later used for the redemption of our 7 3  8  senior notes that matured in august 2013 as noted below and for other corporate purposes 

  

as also discussed in note 11  we issued 125 million principal amount of our 5875 junior subordinated debentures due 2052 in a september 2012 public offering this issue resulted in net proceeds after issue expenses of 121 million and were used to redeem our 71 trust originated preferred securities in the amount of 120 million plus accrued dividends for a total cost of 121 million 

  

also noted in note 11 was our assumption of 20 million of trust preferred securities in connection with our acquisition of family heritage these securities bear interest at a variable rate the threemonth libor plus 330 basis points which is reset each quarter while these securities are callable by us at any time we have no immediate plans to do so 

  

at december 31 2012 our 7 3  8  notes due 2013 in the principal amount of 945 million were reclassified to shortterm debt because of its maturity in 2013 the principal balance and accrued interest for that debt issue was then repaid on its maturity date of august 1 2013 in the total amount of 975 million 

  

our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 325 of required regulatory capital under riskbased capital rbc a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital the 325 target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows the relatively low risk of their product mix and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark at december 31 2013 our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had rbc ratios of approximately 341 should we experience additional impairments andor ratings downgrades in the future that cause the ratio to fall below 325 management has more than sufficient liquidity at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 325 

  

as noted under the caption summary of operations in this report we have an ongoing share repurchase program under this program we acquired 6 million shares at a cost of 360 million in 2013 7 million shares at a cost of 360 million in 2012 and 19 million shares for 788 million in 2011 the majority of purchased shares are retired each year please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption summary of operations in this report 

  

torchmark has increased the quarterly dividend on its common shares over the past three years in the second quarter of 2011 it was raised to 12 per share from 1067 per share in the first quarter of 2012 it was again increased to 15 per share then in the first quarter of 2013 it was raised to 17 per share 

  

shareholders’ equity was 38 billion at december 31 2013 compared with 44 billion at december 31 2012 during the twelve months since december 31 2012 shareholders’ equity was reduced by the 360 million in share purchases under the repurchase program and another 122 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises it was also reduced by 762 million of aftertax unrealized losses in the fixed maturity portfolio but was increased by the 528 million of net income 

  

we plan to use excess cash available at the parent company as efficiently as possible in the future excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in fixed maturities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies 

  

index to financial statements we maintain a significant availableforsale fixedmaturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets while invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets from time to time the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity because of the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  

selected financial data 

  

  

      

fasb guidance provides for an option which if elected would permit us to value our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets  however unlike the accounting rule which permits us to account for changes in our availableforsale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income the guidance requires such changes to be recorded in earnings because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder 

  

index to financial statements liabilities and debt the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results therefore we have not elected this option 

  

torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 105 times in 2013 compared with 105 times in 2012 and 103 times in 2011 this timesinterestearned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pretax income from continuing operations and interest expense a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 

  

financial strength ratings the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by standard  poor’s and a m best the following chart presents these ratings for our four largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2013 

  

   

am best states that it assigns an a superior rating to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations companies rated a excellent are considered to have excellent ability to meet those obligations 

  

the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard  poor’s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics differing only slightly from those rated higher an insurer rated a has strong financial security characteristics but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions that are insurers with higher ratings the plus sign  or minus sign  shows the relative standing within the major rating category 

  

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries such punitive damage claims may have the potential for significant adverse results since torchmark and its subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

approximately 83 of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2013 were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended december 31 2013 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs eligible for deferral consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note 1 — significant accounting policies under the caption deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements additionally the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies known as the value of insurance purchased is included in deferred acquisition costs our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1  

  

approximately 99 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2013 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2013 

  

the remaining 1 of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31 2013 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate 

  

index to financial statements under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

  

valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to manage risk we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixedmaturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

at times the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixedmaturity investments is presented in note 1—significant accounting policies and in note 4—investments under the captions fair value measurements in both notes 

  

impairment of investments we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value where fair value has declined below carrying value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an otherthantemporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

index to financial statements defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2013 our gross liability under these funded plans was 322 million but was offset by assets of 292 million 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause significant differences in reported results for these plans for example a sensitivity analysis is presented below for the impact of change in the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on assets assumed on our defined benefit pension plans expense for the year 2013 and projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2013 

  

   

    

the criteria used to determine the primary assumptions are discussed in note 9 — postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to us note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies and other related data

index to financial statements management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management at torchmark corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis as a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting the company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls accordingly even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time 

  

management evaluated the company’s internal control over financial reporting and based on its assessment determined that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2013 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of torchmark corporation and subsidiaries torchmark as of december 31 2013 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion torchmark maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2013 of torchmark and our report dated february 28 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses all of which are generally based on company experience and on projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

  

index to financial statements underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports pharmacy data doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

index to financial statements risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

medicare part d the medicare part d program is regulated at the federal level by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms this agency periodically examines torchmark’s participating subsidiaries 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in indiana nebraska ohio and new york

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a mature regulated industry populated by many firms we operate in the life and health insurance sectors of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market the development maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical we compete for producing agents with other insurers primarily on the basis of our products and compensation adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical as our competitors seek to hire away our agents from time to time in direct response continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits 

  

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations we serve primarily the middleincome market for individual protection life and health insurance and as a result we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of an economic downturn or otherwise then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether 

  

variations in expected to actual rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test expectedtoactual results actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set accordingly we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income 

  

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products our ability to market these products and our competitive position a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways including the following limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies 

  

rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could have a material adverse effect on our operations including limiting our access to capital markets increasing the cost of debt 

  

index to financial statements impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries and making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

  

ratings reflect only the rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control in addition rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered the models changes to the models could impact the rating agencies’ judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

  

our life products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches labor union members and sales via direct response distribution the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales in recent years labor union membership has experienced minimal growth and has declined as a percentage of employed workers most of our direct response business is solicited either through direct mail insertion into other mail media for distribution internet marketing or by inbound telephone calls significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business 

  

health insurance marketplace risks 

  

congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact our medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of our inforce health insurance business because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future the nature and timing of these changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business 

  

our medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers our medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senioraged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare such as medicare advantage or other health maintenance organizations hmos or managed care plans the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance 

  

our medicare supplement and other health insurance business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales in recent years price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market as well as the market for other health products has been significant characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to underprice new sales in order to gain market share we have elected not to compete on those terms which has negatively affected sales should these industry practices continue it is likely that our sales of health insurance products will remain depressed 

  

an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success because medicare supplement policies are 

  

index to financial statements coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability 

  

investment risks 

  

our investments are subject to market and credit risks our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixedmaturity and shortterm investments a significant portion of our fixedmaturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels financial market performance disruptions in credit markets and general economic conditions as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer additionally because the majority of our investments are longerterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity significant increases in interest rates widening of credit spreads or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable in that case the unrealized loss will be realized at which point we would take an impairment charge reducing our net income 

  

difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses difficult conditions in us capital markets in recent periods caused a notable increase in the troubled status of businesses in which we hold investments if difficulties within these businesses and industries increase there could be deferrals and defaults on amounts owed to us if conditions in the capital markets worsen we could experience credit downgrades or default events within our investment portfolio 

  

a default by an issuer could result in a significant otherthantemporary impairment of that investment causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income the risk of default is higher for bonds with longerterm maturities which we acquire in order to match our longterm insurance obligations we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment also while we have invested in a broad array of industries and issuers in order to attempt to maintain a highly diversified portfolio a significant amount of our investments is in banks insurance companies and other financial institutions which have experienced an increased level of downgrades in recent years moreover we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all material otherthantemporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus leading to lower riskbased capital ratios potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries while we intend to hold our investments until maturity a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income 

  

a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads significant 

  

index to financial statements decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

  

liquidity risks 

  

our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available primarily dividends from our insurance subsidiaries as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity for us also include a variety of short and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper and medium and longterm debt 

  

the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income excluding capital gains on an annual noncumulative basis or 10 of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval accordingly a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations could reduce their capital or cash flow and as a result limit or disallow payment of dividends to us a principal source of our cash flow 

  

we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries although we do not anticipate changes changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses additionally the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock 

  

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital the capital and credit markets have recently experienced extreme instability and disruption for an extended period of time in some cases the markets exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain industries and issuers additionally should credit spreads widen again in the future the interest rate we must pay on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity 

  

index to financial statements decreases due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility therefore as a result our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders not our investors state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising licensing agents policy forms capital adequacy solvency reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business should these changes to our business occur we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations which may change from time to time if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines 

  

we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives in recent years there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries by insurance regulatory authorities which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our agents or employees are improper these actions can result in substantial fines penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may even absent any particular regulatory authority’s interpretation of an issue changing cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to our practices that may in some cases limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business 

  

currently the us federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance however the doddfrank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 establishes a federal insurance office fio within the department of the treasury and the affordable care act created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight cciio originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the direct regulation of the insurance industry we cannot predict what impact if any the fio and cciio as well as any other proposals for federal regulation of insurance could have on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements and reduce our profitability our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

  

index to financial statements gaap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability 

  

if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries we are and in the future may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants and in certain of these matters the plaintiffs are seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis however the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states in which we operate juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit 

  

our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases the costs of settlement or judgments against us or changes in our operations that could result from litigation substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation which in turn could materially harm our business and our business prospects 

  

catastrophic event risk 

  

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality caused by events such as a pandemic an act of terrorism or another event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries across a wide geographic area these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and depending on their severity and geographic scope could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

  

index to financial statements the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total number of policyholders in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event pandemics hurricanes earthquakes and manmade catastrophes including terrorism and war may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 

  

information technology risk 

  

the occurrence of computer viruses network security breaches disasters or other unanticipated events could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations a computer virus could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries destroying valuable data or making it difficult to conduct business in addition despite our implementation of network security measures our servers could be subject to physical and electronic breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 

  

we retain confidential information in our computer systems and rely on sophisticated commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access view misappropriate alter or delete information in the systems including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information in addition an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access use or disclosure of their information any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in inappropriate access use or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter people from purchasing our products subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical legal and other expenses 

  

in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an industrial accident a blackout or a terrorist attack or war our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time even if our employees are able to report to work they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

acquisition on november 1 2012 we acquired family heritage a previously privatelyheld supplemental health insurance carrier information about this acquisition can be found in note 6—acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the results of family heritage subsequent to our acquisition are included in this discussion within our health insurance segment 

  

discontinued operations as described in note 3—discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our subsidiary united investors life insurance company united investors as of december 31 2010 because of the sale united investors’ financial results are excluded from this discussion since those operations were discontinued 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and to a limited extent annuities to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully described in note 14 — business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and the administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations net income rose 6 to 529 million in 2012 from 497 million in 2011 it had declined slightly in 2011 from 499 million in 2010 on a diluted per share basis 2012 net income rose 19 to 541 after a 12 increase in 2011 to 453 from net income of 405 in 2010 the pershare results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program results in 2010 include a 35 million aftertax loss on the disposal of united investors representing 28 per diluted share also each year’s per share net income was affected by realized investment gains which were 025 015 and 020 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively more information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses in this report where there is a more complete discussion also as explained in note 14—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments additionally we do not consider nonoperating items which are not related to the current ongoing reporting performance of our segments to be part of our segment operating income 

  

as shown in the above chart aftertax segment results of operations before discontinued operations rose each year over the prior year from 480 million in 2010 to 494 million in 2011 to 507 million in 2012 the primary contributor to the growth in both 2011 and 2012 was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment in which margins rose 31 million in 2011 and 49 million in 2012 the life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented also contributing to growth in 2012 income was our health insurance segment which provided 8 million of additional margin after a decline of 10 million in 2011 the 2012 improvement was largely due to the increased volume in our medicare part d program while the 2011 decline was a result of the discontinuance of sales of certain limitedbenefit health products in late 2010 due to healthcare reform both 2012 and 2011 have been impacted negatively by declines in excess investment income the measure of profitability of our investment segment these declines in excess investment income have resulted from the continuing low interest rate environment which has pressured investment yields and spreads on policy benefit requirements discussed more fully under the caption investments in this report 

  

index to financial statements in 2012 this pressure on excess investment income was increased as an unusual number of calls resulting from a new regulation affecting bank hybrid securities caused us to replace these higher yielding securities with securities at lower yields due to the current lowinterestrate environment also in 2012 there was a 7 million increase in stock compensation expense which negatively affected the results during the year the increase in stock compensation expense resulted primarily from the increase in the value of torchmark’s stock and not from an increase in the number of grants 

  

total revenues rose 6 in 2012 to 359 billion they were flat in 2011 at 338 billion compared with 337 billion in 2010 life premium rose 5 or 82 million in 2012 to 181 billion life premium increased 63 million in 2011 to 173 billion net investment income was essentially flat at 694 million in 2012 after rising 2 or 17 million in 2011 health premium increased 13 to 105 billion in 2012 and contributed 117 million to 2012 revenue growth but health premium negatively affected revenue growth in 2011 as discussed below 

  

while life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december 31 2012 margins as a percentage of premium have risen even more rising in 2012 to 28 from 27 in 2011 and 26 in 2010 segment profits for life insurance were not only positively affected by the premium growth but also by improvements in persistency in both periods life net sales increased 6 in 2012 to 343 million but declined 1 in 2011 to 325 million life insurance segment results are discussed further in this report under the caption life insurance 

  

we primarily market medicare supplement insurance medicare part d prescription drug insurance limitedbenefit cancer and accident health products prior to september 2010 we marketed an underage65 limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical product health premium increased 117 million or 13 in 2012 as a result of the addition of a large number of new lowincome medicare part d autoenrollees in the 2012 plan year however 2011 health premium declined 6 to 930 million as a result of the discontinuance of certain limitedbenefit health products because of healthcare reform mentioned above medicare supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium and we have experienced growth in net sales in this product in each successive year medicare supplement premium was 432 million in 2012 but has declined slightly in each successive year as lapses have exceeded new sales our medicare part d premium rose 62 to 318 in 2012 as a result of the previouslynoted addition of lowincome autoenrollees in the 2012 plan due to increased competition for the 2013 plan year we expect a slight decrease in 2013 part d premium see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

  

we offer fixed annuities but we do not emphasize sales of annuity products favoring life insurance instead with the sale of united investors in 2010 we disposed of 37 of our annuity deposit balance see the caption annuities for further discussion of the annuity segment 

  

as previously mentioned the investment segment’s pretax profitability or excess investment income declined in both 2012 and 2011 profitability in this segment is based on three major components net investment income required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to insurance products and financing costs in recent years growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio one reason that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of also there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested during which the funds are held in cash growth in total investment income has also been somewhat negatively affected by torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments in 2012 net investment income rose 1 while the portfolio at amortized cost grew 4 as new money yields available have continued to decline 

  

the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets the lower newmoney yields resulting from the lowinterestrate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow we have implemented certain strategies to offset this effect including lowering the discount rate on new business and increasing premium rates on 

  

index to financial statements sales of new products as discussed under the caption investments  financing costs which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and shortterm debt are also deducted from net investment income financing costs in 2012 increased 3 to 80 million primarily as a result of two new debt offerings issued in the latter half of 2012 as described below financing costs also increased from 75 million in 2010 to 78 million in 2011 primarily a result of increased charges related to our letters of credit facility 

  

torchmark’s current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investmentgrade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives approximately 96 of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which 96 were investment grade at december 31 2012 the average quality rating of the portfolio was a the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alta mortgages no direct investment in residential mortgages no counterparty risks no credit default swaps or derivative contracts see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and n ote 4—investments in the notes to consolidated statements of operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment 

  

as noted earlier we issued two new debt offerings during 2012 our 300 million principal amount 38 senior notes due 2022 and our 125 million principal amount 5875 junior subordinated debentures due 2052 both issued in september proceeds from the senior notes were 297 million but 150 million were purchased by our insurance subsidiaries and were eliminated in consolidation proceeds from this offering provided funding for the retirement of our 7 3  8  senior notes due in august 2013 and for the acquisition of family heritage in november 2012 the 121 million net proceeds from the subordinated debentures were used to fund the call of our 120 million principal amount 71 trust originated preferred securities in october 2012 more information on these transactions can be found in note 6—acquisition and note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 

  

in 2011 income from continuing operations was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring nonoperating items we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations as reported in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption settlements  we were involved in certain issues in which we incurred settlement losses and expenses we settled a state administrative matter in the pretax amount of 69 million 45 million after tax and accrued an estimated liability for a litigation amount which settled in early 2012 in the pretax amount of 120 million 78 million after tax both of these issues involved matters arising many years ago additionally in connection with the 2012 purchase of family heritage as described in note 6 —acquisition  we incurred 29 million of acquisitionrelated expenses 19 million after tax the state administrative settlement the litigation accrual and the acquisition expenses are included in “other operating expense” in the consolidated statements of operations  however as described in note 1  we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are nonoperating items when evaluating the results of current operations and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods 

  

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises due to poor economic conditions we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2009 however in the first quarter of 2010 the board of directors reactivated the company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management in consultation with the board determines to be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december 31 2012

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows the following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations as described in note 14—business segments  

  

life insurance life insurance is our largest insurance segment with 2012 life premium representing 63 of total premium life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 72 of the total in 2012 additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

life insurance premium rose 5 to 181 billion in 2012 after having increased 4 in 2011 to 173 billion life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows

dollar amounts in thousands 

  

   

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue net sales is annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

  

index to financial statements annualized life premium in force was 190 billion at december 31 2012 an increase of 4 over 181 billion a year earlier annualized life premium in force was 175 billion at december 31 2010

the american income exclusive agency has historically focused primarily on marketing to members of labor unions while the labor union market is still the backbone of american income’s business the agency has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help to ensure sustainable growth it is torchmark’s highest margin business the american income agency was also the largest contributor to life premium and net sales of any torchmark distribution method in 2012 life premium for this agency rose 9 to 664 million after having risen 8 in 2011 net sales increased 12 in 2012 after having risen 3 in 2011 net sales rose 8 in 2010 the average face amount of policies issued in 2012 was approximately 33 thousand as is the case with all of torchmark’s agency distribution systems continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count the american income agent count was 5176 at december 31 2012 compared with 4381 a year earlier an increase of 18 the agent count increased 12 in 2011 management’s primary objective is to grow middle management in the agency to help ensure sustainable growth this is being achieved through an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train personnel in 2011 we began providing more homeoffice and webinar training programs these programs are designed to provide each agent from new recruits to top level managers coaching and instruction specifically designed for his or her level of experience and responsibilities

index to financial statements response focuses primarily on young middleincome households with children the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product for this unit not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales it is also a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders also both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time at this time we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response’s premier markets historically the direct response unit’s growth has been fueled by constant innovation in recent years the internet and inbound call center production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased internet marketing activities and focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center 

  

the direct response operation accounted for 35 of our life insurance premium during 2012 increasing 6 over 2011 premium life premium for this unit rose 5 in 2011 and 6 in 2010 net sales rose 3 to 141 million in 2012 after being flat in 2011 firstyear collected premium rose 5 to 93 million after a decline of 1 to 89 million in 2011 the average face amount of policies issued in 2012 was approximately 20 thousand 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency markets primarily life insurance and supplemental health insurance focusing on middleincome customers life premium income for this agency was 282 million in 2012 a 2 decrease compared with  288 million in 2011 life premium also declined 2 in 2011 from 2010 first year collected premium declined 15 in 2012 after having declined 10 in 2011 the average face amount of life policies issued in 2012 was approximately 23 thousand 

  

the liberty national agency’s net sales declined 11 to 32 million in 2012 after having declined 19 a year earlier as is the case with all of our agencies sales are driven by the size of the agent force the liberty agency had 1419 producing agents at december 31 2012 compared with 1345 a year earlier an increase of 6 the producing agent count declined 33 during 2011 

  

the recent declines in premium and sales were due primarily to changes in the cost structure of the agency that have affected agent counts in recent years several years ago management began a process to convert the agency from a fixed expense salarybased agency model to a commissiondriven variablecost model even though we knew the conversion would result in agent defections the change had to be made to maintain acceptable underwriting margins on new business and ensure the longterm survival and growth of this distribution channel this was a significant cultural change and it has been implemented gradually to minimize agency disruption as much as possible declines in agent count finally ceased in february 2012 and there was a slow steady increase in agent count for the remainder of the year liberty has historically focused its marketing efforts in smaller rural areas in the southeastern united states going forward management expects to grow this agency through nationwide geographic expansion into more urban areas and crossselling individual life insurance to customers who purchased group health insurance through liberty’s worksite marketing program 

  

we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the military agency the united american independent agency and other small sales agencies the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who sell primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of wholelife products with term insurance riders military premium represented 10 of life premium at december 31 2012 the united american independent agency represented approximately 1 of torchmark’s total life premium at that date as their sales of torchmark products consist primarily of health insurance

health insurance excluding medicare part d health premium other than part d has declined in each successive year presented falling 1 in 2012 to 730 million and declining 6 in 2011 the declines in premium resulted primarily from the previouslymentioned runoff of a block of discontinued hospitalsurgical plans net sales increased 22 in 2012 to 78 million due in part to the acquisition of family heritage which contributed 12 of the increase net sales declined 1 in 2011 and declined 33 in 2010 firstyear collected premium increased 17 in 2012 after a 22 decline in 2011 family heritage accounted for 10 of the 2012 increase 

  

medicare supplement provides the greatest amount of health premium partially because medicare supplement products are generally more persistent than the limitedbenefit products but also because of improved sales in recent periods medicare supplement premium represented 59 of nonpart d health premium in 2012 compared with 60 in 2011 and 58 in 2010 

  

index to financial statements the ua independent agency is torchmark’s largest in terms of health premium income and sales producing 41 of health premium and 54 of health sales this agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large multistate organizations down to oneperson offices all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies torchmark had 2003 active producing agents at december 31 2012 compared with 1447 a year earlier this agency is our largest producer of medicare supplement insurance with 272 million or 63 of our medicare supplement premium income in 2012 net sales for this agency increased 29 to 42 million in 2012 after having increased 2 in 2011 from 32 million in 2010 total health premium income for the ua independent agency was 299 million in 2012 a 3 decline from 2011 premium of 306 million premium income also declined 3 in 2011 these declines in premium have resulted due to lapses of limitedbenefit products being greater than new sales 

  

the family heritage agency was acquired by torchmark’s acquisition of family heritage on november 1 2012 as discussed in note 6—acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements  this agency markets primarily limitedbenefit supplemental health insurance in nonurban areas most of their policies include a cashback feature such as a returnofpremium feature whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy management expects to grow this agency through geographic expansion and incorporation of torchmark’s recruiting programs this agency contributed 30 million in health premium income during the twomonth period of 2012 annualized health premium in force at december 31 2012 was 188 million 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency represented 36 of all torchmark nonpart d health premium income at 264 million in 2012 the liberty agency markets limitedbenefit health supplemental products consisting primarily of cancer insurance much of the liberty’s health business is now generated through worksite marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees in 2012 health premium income in the agency declined 9 from prior year premium of 290 million as noted earlier the premium decline was due primarily to the runoff of the block of discontinued hospitalsurgical business and the previouslydiscussed restructuring of this agency to a commissiondriven model 

  

the american income exclusive agency predominantly a life insurance distribution channel was our third largest health insurance distributor based on premium income in 2012 its health plans are comprised of various limitedbenefit plans approximately 69 of the agency’s 2012 health premium was from accident policies sales of the plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 

  

health premium at this agency was flat in 2012 at 80 million after rising 1 in 2011 however net health sales declined 9 to 9 million in 2012 after a 27 decline in 2011 because this agency focuses on life products net health sales comprised only 5 of the american income agency’s total net sales in 2012 

  

direct response  primarily a life operation also offers health insurance which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups in all three years considered net health sales were approximately 5 million in 2012 net health sales for this group represented approximately 3 of direct response’s total life and health net sales direct response health premium income has risen each year over the prior year health premium rose 2 in 2012 to 58 million and 5 in 2011 

  

index to financial statements medicare part d torchmark through its subsidiary united american offers coverage under the government’s medicare part d plan the medicare part d plan is a standalone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american under part d private carriers are the primary insurers while cms provides significant premium subsidies and reinsurance our medicare part d product is sold through the direct response operation and to groups through the ua independent agency part d net sales were 114 million in 2012 compared with 115 million in 2011 and 39 million in 2010 we count only sales to new firsttime enrollees in net sales and the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees total medicare part d premium was 318 million in 2012 compared with 197 million in 2011 an increase of 62 part d premium declined 6 in 2011 

  

changes in part d premium generally result from changes in the number of enrollees at the beginning of the 2013 part d plan year united american had approximately 254 thousand enrollees compared with 215 thousand at the beginning of the 2012 plan year 144 thousand at the beginning of the 2011 plan year and 157 thousand at the beginning of the 2010 plan year united american had large growth in part d enrollees in 2012 as a result of a new lower cost part d plan which allowed us to pick up a large number of lowincome autoenrollees and to grow our own individual sales due to intensified price competition for the 2013 plan year we will not qualify for as many new autoenrollees in 2013 as we did in 2012 however we expect that only a small number of the autoenrollees assigned to us in 2012 will be reassigned to another part d carrier while the number of part d enrollees at the beginning of plan year 2013 was higher than at the beginning of plan year 2012 it was lower than the number of enrollees at the end of 2012 the enrollee count grew throughout 2012 due to significant additions of lowincome enrollees each month but we lost several employer group part d cases at the end of 2012 as such we expect a lower average number of enrollees for 2013 than we had in 2012 and we anticipate a slight decline in part d premium in 2013 

  

we participate in the medicare part d program because of our experience with the seniorage market and with medicare supplements the government assurances with regard to the risksharing agreements for participating insurers limitedrisk due to the incremental income added to our health insurance margins and the renewal of the business every year due to our experience with service to the seniorage market and the use of our existing direct response marketing system entry to this business required little new investment however as with any governmentsponsored program the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market 

  

index to financial statements as presented in the following table torchmark’s health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense increased 4 to 197 million in 2012 but declined 5 in 2011 to 189 million as a percentage of premium income margins were 20 in both 2011 and 2010 as compared with 19 in 2012 the 2012 percentage reflects the greater proportion of medicare part d business which has a much higher benefit ratio

index to financial statements annuities as described in note 3—discontinued operations  we sold our subsidiary united investors on december 31 2010 united investors was our variable annuity carrier and a primary carrier of fixed annuities because we disposed of approximately 37 of our annuity deposit balance in the sale including all of our variable annuities we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward 

  

our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2012 2011 and 2010 were 135 billion 129 billion and 124 billion respectively underwriting income was 35 million 23 million 13 million in each of the years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

while the fixed annuity account balance has increased modestly each year over the prior year and underwriting income has increased each year as well policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year the majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are not based on account size these charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements which can result in negative net policy obligations in each of the years presented the spreads for fixed annuities increased over the prior year as a result of credited rate reductions on the inforce annuities accounting for the growth in underwriting margin the amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits

index to financial statements insurance administrative expenses rose 4 in 2012 after having increased 2 in 2011 as a percentage of premium they increased 1 in 2011 but declined 2 in 2012 to 58 the 2012 increase in total insurance administrative expense of 63 million was primarily the result of the expiration of a third party agreement under which we were reimbursed a net of 52 million in 2011 for providing policy administration services and 16 million from the addition of family heritage’s expenses in 2012 the 11 decline in employee costs in 2011 was primarily due to unusually high employee health insurance costs in 2010 stock compensation expense has risen in each successive year as the value of torchmark stock has increased resulting in higher values for grants of stock and options and not because of an increase in the number of grants as stated in note 14—business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 

  

as a result of the acquisition of family heritage in late 2012 as described in note 6— acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we incurred expenses related to the transaction of 29 million additionally as mentioned in note 1— significant accounting policies  we incurred two settlement expense issues in 2011 that related to events occurring many years ago the settlement of a state administrative issue of 7 million and a litigation issue in the estimated amount of 12 million the latter item was settled in that amount in 2012 in addition to these two 2011 items we sold aviation equipment in 2011 at a loss of 979 thousand while all of these nonrecurring expenses were included in “operating expenses” for the respective year in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with accounting guidance they are considered as nonoperating expenses by management 

  

investments we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14— business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used over 54 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

index to financial statements excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  

  

     

excess investment income declined 22 million or 9 in 2012 from the prior year excess investment income declined 6 million or 2 in 2011 excess investment income has been pressured over the past three years as a result of the impact of lower interest rates on net investment income coupled with the increase in required interest on net policy liabilities discussed later under this caption on a per diluted share basis excess investment income rose 3 to 242 per share in 2012 after having risen 10 in the prior year the favorable increases in the per share amounts relative to the changes in dollar amounts for excess investment income are a result of share repurchases 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income as adjusted for the segment analysis which rose 1 to 716 million in 2012 it increased 3 to 707 million in 2011 from 685 million in 2010 presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets 

  

   

growth in net investment income has generally been slower than growth in mean invested assets in recent years due to the declining interest rate environment in a declining interest rate environment the overall portfolio yield will decrease as new money is invested at lower yields especially when the new investments are replacing higheryielding investments that mature or are otherwise disposed of approximately 50 of the invested assets added in 2010 through 2012 replaced higheryielding assets that matured or were disposed of during that period this level of replacement activity was higher than normal 

  

index to financial statements we had more sales of investments than usual in each of the years 2010 through 2012 these sales were generally made due to credit concerns or for tax purposes additionally in 2012 we had an unusually large number of securities called fixed maturity securities are more likely to be called in a declining interestrate environment in addition to bonds with scheduled call dates our portfolio includes bankissued hybrid securities with provisions allowing the security to be called in the event of a change in capital treatment many banks chose to call their hybrid securities in 2012 because the doddfrank act phases out the partial equity credit historically allowed for these securities 

  

at december 31 2012 we still held 262 million of bank hybrids callable without a makewhole provision the average yield on these securities was 726 approximately 51 of these securities was below investment grade to the extent these are called there would be a reduction in net investment income however the ratio of belowinvestmentgrade securities to our total investment portfolio and statutory required capital would also decrease 

  

in 2010 growth in net investment income slightly exceeded the growth in the portfolio because of the uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets in 2009 we held significantly more cash and shortterm investments than in other years holding this larger balance of lowyielding securities in 2009 resulted in the unusually high growth rate in 2010 as these loweryielding cash balances were invested in 2010 

  

excess investment income is reduced by the required interest on net insurance policy liabilities because we consider these amounts to be components of the profitability of our insurance segments required interest is the actuarial interest assumption used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force essentially all of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interestrate protection policies not investment products and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for longduration insurance products formerly sfas 60 now incorporated into asc 9442005 which mandates that interest rate assumptions be “locked in” for the life of that block of business each calendar year we set the assumed discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year and cannot be changed except in the event of a premium deficiency the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in as such the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years changes in the overall weightedaverage discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weightedaverage discount rate due to the size of our in force business information about interest on policy liabilities is shown in the following table 

  

index to financial statements required interest on net insurance policy liabilities 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

the combined average interest discount rate has risen in each of the last three years due to the changes in the mix of the in force business discussed above 

  

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs 

  

the table below presents the components of financing costs 

  

analysis of financing costs 

amounts in thousands 

  

  

   

financing costs increased 3 million or 3 in 2012 they rose 2 million or 3 in 2011 the increase in financing costs in 2012 reflects the increased interest expense from the issuance in september 2012 of 300 million principal amount of our 38 senior notes due in 2022 150 million of which is eliminated in consolidation also in september 2012 we issued our 5875 junior subordinated debentures due 2052 for 125 million principal amount but called our 120 million 71 trust preferred securities one month later the 2011 and 2012 increases in interest on shortterm debt were primarily a result of the 21 million increase in financing charges on our letter of credit facility arising from the december 2010 restructuring of our credit facility more information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the financial condition section of this report and in note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

index to financial statements excess investment income benefits from increases in longterm rates available on new investments and decreases in shortterm borrowing rates of these two factors higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at shortterm rates therefore torchmark would benefit if rates especially longterm rates were to rise 

  

however growth rates in our excess investment income decline when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs such as we have experienced in recent periods in an extended lowinterestrate environment the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower longterm rates we believe however the decline would be relatively slow as on average only 2 to 3 of fixed maturities are expected to run off each year over the next five years 

  

in response to the lower interest rates we reduced the discount rate on life policies issued in 2012 we also raised the premium rates for new business on major life products in 2012 the increased premiums will provide additional margin on these policies to help offset the possible future reductions in excess investment income and have not had a detrimental impact on sales 

  

because actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weightedaverage discount rate of our in force block we don’t expect an extended lowinterestrate environment to cause a loss recognition event 

  

investment acquisitions  torchmark’s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investmentgrade fixed maturities generally with long maturities maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date that meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities further we believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable if such longerterm securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives we consider investing in shortterm securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time during calendar years 2010 through 2012 torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities primarily with longerterm maturities as presented in the chart below 

  

the following table summarizes selected information for fixedmaturity purchases the effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield this date is commonly known as the “worst call date” two different average life calculations are shown average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date 

  

fixed maturity acquisitions selected information 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

index to financial statements we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment however the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 

  

during the three years 2010 through 2012 we have invested primarily in investmentgrade corporate bonds purchases in 2012 and 2011 consisted almost entirely of these corporates during 2010 we acquired a significant amount of taxable municipal bonds primarily build america bonds authorized by the american recovery and retirement act of 2009 the investments in these municipal bonds consisted almost exclusively of general obligation bonds and revenue bonds for essential services in assessing the creditworthiness of these bonds we took into account a number of factors including the geographic location of the municipalities 

  

new cash flow available for investment is primarily provided through our insurance operations but has also been affected by other factors issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past three years were a factor issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost calls increase funds available for investment but as noted earlier in this discussion they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called issuer calls were 650 million in 2012 187 million in 2011 and 109 million in 2010 the higher level of acquisitions in 2012 was primarily due to the additional funds available from the higher level of 2012 calls 

  

portfolio analysis because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms the following table presents a comparison of torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2012 with the latest industry data 

  

   

at december 31 2012 approximately 96 of our investments at book value or amortized cost were in a diversified fixedmaturity portfolio policy loans which are secured by policy cash values made up an additional 3 the remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities mortgage loans and other longterm and shortterm investments 

  

index to financial statements because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities an analysis of our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 is as follows

index to financial statements credit risk sensitivity credit risk relates to the level of uncertainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity approximately 85 of our fixedmaturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities including redeemable preferred and assetbacked securities as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities credit risk is a concern we mitigate this ongoing risk in part by acquiring only investmentgrade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis we also seek to reduce credit risk by spreading investments over a large number of issuers and a wide range of industry sectors 

  

the following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at december 31 2012 

  

   

at december 31 2012 approximately 27 of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost 26 at fair value were in the financial sector including 15 in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 7 in banks at amortized cost financial guarantors mortgage insurers and insurance brokers comprised approximately 5 of the portfolio at amortized cost after financials the next largest sector was utilities which comprised 17 of the portfolio at amortized cost the balance of the portfolio is spread among 410 issuers in a wide variety of sectors as previously noted gross unrealized losses were 89 million at december 31 2012 declining from 239 million a year earlier the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of 1578 million at december 31 2012 

  

index to financial statements an analysis of the fixedmaturity portfolio by a composite rating at december 31 2012 is shown in the table below the composite rating for each security is the average of the security’s ratings as assigned by moody’s investor service standard  poor’s fitch ratings and dominion bond rating service ltd the ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

the portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of a based on amortized cost approximately 95 of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by subprime or alta mortgages loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower we have no direct investments in residential mortgages nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts we do not participate in securities lending there are no offbalance sheet investments as all investments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets  other than 11 million of german government bonds at amortized cost and fair value we have no direct exposure to european sovereign debt 

  

our current investment policy is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

an analysis of changes in belowinvestment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost is as follows 

  

   

  

index to financial statements market risk sensitivity torchmark’s financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since 96 of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixedmaturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixedrate investments the portfolio is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value under normal market conditions we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and generally the intent to hold these investments to maturity the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however in accordance with gaap these liabilities are not marked to market 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2012 and 2011 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points 

  

   

index to financial statements realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits we also incur acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses generally occur only incidentally usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the periodtoperiod trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results 

  

the following table summarizes our taxeffected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2012

as described in note 4— investments under the caption otherthan temporary impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we wrote certain securities down to fair value during each year 2010 through 2012 as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in note 1—significant accounting policies and in our critical accounting policies in this report the writedowns resulted in pretax charges of 56 million in 2012 36 million after tax 20 thousand in 2011 13 thousand after tax and 5 million in 2010 32 million after tax in 2010 we acquired 73 million book value of our 9 1  4  senior notes at a cost of 89 million resulting in an aftertax loss on debt redemption of 11 million in 2012 we redeemed our 71 trust originated preferred securities recording a loss on redemption of 41 million 27 million after tax 

  

index to financial statements financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

insurance subsidiary liquidity the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes the funds to provide for policy benefits the majority of which are paid in future periods are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities to meet these longterm obligations in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restriction the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains the leading source of the excess cash is investment income however due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control a significant portion of the excess cash comes from underwriting income 

  

parent company liquidity cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt operating expenses of the parent and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders in 2012 the parent received 493 million of dividends and transfers from its insurance subsidiaries as compared with 790 million in 2011 and 401 million in 2010 the 2011 dividend included 305 million of additional dividends available as a result of the sale of united investors including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations shareholder dividends and other expenses but before share repurchases torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in 2012 of approximately 371 million compared with 672 million in 2011 including the 305 million from the sale of united investors parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases in 2013 it is expected that the parent company will receive approximately 506 million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries and that approximately 365 million will be available as excess cash flow certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 12 — shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company as additional liquidity the parent held 2 million of cash and shortterm investments at december 31 2012 compared with 27 million a year earlier the parent also had available a 144 million receivable from subsidiaries at december 31 2012 

  

shortterm borrowings an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 600 million as of december 31 2012 we had available 177 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility as we also had a year earlier there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market under this facility during the three years ended december 31 2012 for detailed information about this line of credit facility see the commercial paper section of note 11 — debt  

  

in summary torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2013 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of additional debt a shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing 

  

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were 943 million in 2012 compared with 859 million in 2011 and 103 billion in 2010 in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies have received 661 million in investment calls and tenders and 76 million of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2012 maturities tenders and calls totaled 410 million in 2011 and 639 million in 2010 

  

index to financial statements our cash and shortterm investments were 157 million at yearend 2012 and 105 million at yearend 2011 additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 136 billion at december 31 2012 however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as described in note 11 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt torchmark had outstanding 120 million par amount 71 trust preferred securities at december 31 2011 but these securities were redeemed during 2012 the capital trust liable for these securities was the legal entity responsible for the securities and facilitated the payment of dividends to shareholders the trust was an offbalance sheet arrangement which we were required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules because the capital trust was considered to be a variable interest entity in which we had no variable interest while these liabilities were not on our consolidated balance sheets  they were represented by torchmark’s 71 junior subordinated debentures due to the trust in the amount of 124 million which was on our balance sheet at december 31 2011 under the caption “due to affiliates” 

  

as a part of its abovementioned credit facility torchmark had outstanding 198 million in standby letters of credit at december 31 2012 however these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole 

  

as of december 31 2012 we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of thirdparty entities other than as described above all of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 15 — commitments and contingencies 

  

the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december 31 2012 

  

amounts in millions 

  

  

      

index to financial statements capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in note 11 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements longterm funded debt and shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2012 our 7 3  8  notes due 2013 have been reclassified from longterm funded debt to shortterm debt because of its current maturity in august 2013 a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

the carrying value of the longterm funded debt was  990 million at december 31 2012 compared with 914 million a year earlier as fully explained in note 11—debt  we issued 300 million principal amount of 38 senior notes due in 2022 in september 2012 for proceeds of 297 million in a public offering however 150 million of the offering was acquired by torchmark insurance subsidiaries and was eliminated in consolidation resulting in net proceeds after issue expenses to the consolidated group of 147 million the majority of the 297 million proceeds received by the parent were used to acquire family heritage as described in note 6—acquisition the balance was invested to be used for the redemption of our 7 3  8  senior notes that mature in august 2013 or at an earlier time if opportunities to repurchase these notes become available and for other corporate purposes 

  

as also discussed in note 11  we issued 125 million principal amount of our 5875 junior subordinated debentures due 2052 in a september 2012 public offering this issue resulted in net proceeds after issue expenses of 121 million and were used to redeem our 71 trust originated preferred securities in the amount of 120 million plus accrued dividends for a total cost of 121 million 

  

also noted in note 11 was our assumption of 20 million of trust preferred securities in connection with our acquisition of family heritage these securities bear interest at a variable rate the threemonth libor plus 330 basis points which is reset each quarter while these securities are callable by us at any time we have no immediate plans to do so 

  

our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 325 of required regulatory capital under riskbased capital rbc a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital the 325 target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows the relatively low risk of their product mix and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark at december 31 2012 our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had rbc ratios of approximately 348 should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future that cause the ratio to fall below 325 management has more than sufficient liquidity at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 325 

  

as noted under the caption summary of operations in this report we have an ongoing share repurchase program under this program we acquired 7 million shares at a cost of 360 million in 2012 19 million shares at a cost of 788 million in 2011 and 6 million shares for 204 million in 2010 the majority of purchased shares are retired each year please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption summary of operations in this report 

  

torchmark has increased the dividend on its common shares over the past three years in the first quarter of 2010 the dividend was increased from 0933 per share to 10 per share and in the fourth quarter of 2010 it was further increased to 1067 per share in the second quarter of 2011 it was raised to 12 per share and in the first quarter of 2012 it was again increased to 15 per share 

  

shareholders’ equity was 44 billion at december 31 2012 compared with 39 billion at december 31 2011 during the twelve months since december 31 2011 shareholders’ equity was reduced by the 360 million in share purchases under the repurchase program and another 210 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises but has been increased by the 529 million of net income 204 million from option exercises and by aftertax unrealized gains of 404 million in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved 

  

we plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in fixed maturities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies 

  

index to financial statements we maintain a significant availableforsale fixedmaturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets while invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets from time to time the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity because of the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  

selected financial data 

  

  

      

fasb guidance provides for an option which if elected would permit us to value our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets  however unlike the accounting rule which permits us to account for changes in our availableforsale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income the guidance requires such changes to be recorded in earnings because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder 

  

index to financial statements liabilities and debt the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results therefore we have not elected this option 

  

torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 105 times in 2012 compared with 103 times in 2011 and 109 times in 2010 this timesinterestearned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pretax income from continuing operations and interest expense a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 

  

financial strength ratings 

  

the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by standard  poor’s and a m best the following chart presents these ratings for our four largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2012 

  

   

am best states that it assigns an a superior rating to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 

  

the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard  poor’s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics differing only slightly from those rated higher the minus sign  shows the relative standing within the major rating category 

  

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries such punitive damage claims that are tried in alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined additionally it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

approximately 82 of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2012 were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended december 31 2012 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs eligible for deferral consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note 1 — significant accounting policies under the caption deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements additionally the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies known as the value of insurance purchased is included in deferred acquisition costs our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note 1  

  

approximately 98 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2012 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2012 

  

the remaining 2 of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31 2012 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate 

  

index to financial statements under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

  

valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to manage risk we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixedmaturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

at times the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixedmaturity investments is presented in note 1—significant accounting policies and in note 4—investments under the captions fair value measurements in both notes 

  

impairment of investments we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value where fair value has declined below carrying value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an otherthantemporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2012 our gross liability under these funded plans was 353 million but was offset by assets of 278 million 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected our discount rate rate of return on assets and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in note 9 — postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to us note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies and other related data

management at torchmark corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis as a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting the company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at family heritage life insurance company of america which was acquired on november 1 2012 and whose financial statements reflect total assets and total revenue constituting 46 and 09 respectively of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 

  

there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls accordingly even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of torchmark corporation and subsidiaries “torchmark” as of december 31 2012 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

as described in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at family heritage life insurance company of america which was acquired on november 1 2012 and whose financial statements constitute 46 of total assets and 09 of total revenue of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 accordingly our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at family heritage life insurance company of america 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion torchmark maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 of torchmark and our report dated february 28 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

annuities 

  

annuity products offered include singlepremium and flexiblepremium deferred annuities annuities in each of the three years ending december 31 2011 comprised less than 1 of premium 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses all of which are generally based on company experience and on projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

  

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

  

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis a list of the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in the financial statements  see note 6 — future policy benefit reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities fixed maturities represented 96 of total investments at fair value at december 31 2011  see note 4 — investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis  

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in indiana nebraska and new york 

  

insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions 

  

personnel 

  

at the end of 2011 torchmark had 2249 employees and 938 licensed employees under sales contracts 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a mature regulated industry populated by many firms we operate in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market the development maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical we compete for producing agents with other insurers primarily on the basis of our products and compensation adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical as our competitors seek to hire away our agents from time to time increased competition has led to a reduction in agents in our united american branch office agency and united american independent agency which have historically been our major health distribution channels in direct response continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits 

  

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations we serve primarily the middleincome market for individual protection life and health insurance and as a result we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of an economic downturn or otherwise then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether 

  

variations in expected to actual rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test expectedtoactual results actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set accordingly we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income 

  

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products our ability to market these products and our competitive position a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways including the following limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies 

  

rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could have a material adverse effect on our operations including limiting our access to capital markets increasing the cost of debt 

  

impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries and making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

  

ratings reflect only the rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control in addition rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered the models changes to the models could impact the rating agencies’ judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

  

our life products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches labor union members and sales via direct response distribution the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales in recent years labor union membership has experienced minimal growth and has declined as a percentage of employed workers most of our direct response business is solicited either through direct mail or by insertion into other mail media for distribution significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business 

  

health insurance marketplace risks 

  

congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact our medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of our inforce health insurance business because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future the nature and timing of these changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business 

  

our medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers our medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senioraged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare such as health maintenance organizations hmos and other managed care or private plans the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance 

  

our medicare supplement and other health insurance business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales in recent years price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market as well as the market for other health products has been significant characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to underprice new sales in order to gain market share we have elected not to compete on those terms which has negatively affected sales should these industry practices continue it is likely that our sales of health insurance products will remain depressed 

  

an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success because medicare supplement policies are 

  

coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability 

  

investment risks 

  

our investments are subject to market and credit risks our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixedmaturity and shortterm investments a significant portion of our fixedmaturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels financial market performance disruptions in credit markets and general economic conditions as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer additionally because the majority of our investments are longerterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity significant increases in interest rates widening of credit spreads or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable in that case the unrealized loss will be realized at which point we would take an impairment charge reducing our net income 

  

difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses difficult conditions in us capital markets in recent periods caused a notable increase in the troubled status of businesses in which we hold investments if difficulties within these businesses and industries increase there could be deferrals and defaults on amounts owed to us if conditions in the capital markets worsen we could experience credit downgrades or default events within our investment portfolio 

  

a default by an issuer could result in a significant otherthantemporary impairment of that investment causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income the risk of default is higher for bonds with longerterm maturities which we acquire in order to match our longterm insurance obligations we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment also while we have invested in a broad array of industries and issuers in order to attempt to maintain a highly diversified portfolio a significant amount of our investments is in banks insurance companies and other financial institutions which have experienced an increased level of downgrades in recent years moreover we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all material otherthantemporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus leading to lower riskbased capital ratios potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries while we intend to hold our investments until maturity a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income 

  

a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the discount rates used to calculate the net policy liabilities while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads significant 

  

decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

  

liquidity risks 

  

our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available primarily dividends from our insurance subsidiaries as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity for us also include a variety of short and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper and medium and longterm debt 

  

the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income excluding capital gains on an annual noncumulative basis or 10 of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval accordingly a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations could reduce their capital or cash flow and as a result limit or disallow payment of dividends to us a principal source of our cash flow 

  

we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries although we do not anticipate changes changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses additionally the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock 

  

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital the capital and credit markets have recently experienced extreme instability and disruption for an extended period of time in some cases the markets exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain industries and issuers additionally should credit spreads widen again in the future the interest rate we must pay on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities 

  

or rating agencies take negative actions against us our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility therefore as a result our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders not our investors state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising licensing agents policy forms capital adequacy solvency reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations which may change from time to time if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines 

  

we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives in recent years there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries by insurance regulatory authorities which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our agents or employees are improper these actions can result in substantial fines penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may even absent any particular regulatory authority’s interpretation of an issue changing cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to our practices that may in some cases limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business 

  

currently the us federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance however the doddfrank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 establishes a federal insurance office fio within the department of the treasury and the patient protection affordable care act created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight cciio originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the regulation of the insurance industry we cannot predict what impact if any the fio and cciio as well as any other proposals for federal regulation of insurance could have on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements and reduce our profitability our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are 

  

required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability 

  

if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief

litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries we are and in the future may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants and in certain of these matters the plaintiffs are seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis however the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states in which we operate juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit 

  

our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases the costs of settlement or judgments against us or changes in our operations that could result from litigation substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation which in turn could materially harm our business and our business prospects 

  

catastrophic event risk 

  

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality caused by events such as a pandemic an act of terrorism or another event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries across a wide geographic area these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and depending on their severity and geographic scope could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

  

the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total number of policyholders in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event pandemics hurricanes earthquakes and man 

  

made catastrophes including terrorism and war may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 

  

information technology risk 

  

the occurrence of computer viruses network security breaches disasters or other unanticipated events could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations a computer virus could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries destroying valuable data or making it difficult to conduct business in addition despite our implementation of network security measures our servers could be subject to physical and electronic breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 

  

we retain confidential information in our computer systems and rely on sophisticated commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access view misappropriate alter or delete information in the systems including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information in addition an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access use or disclosure of their information any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in inappropriate access use or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter people from purchasing our products subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical legal and other expenses 

  

in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an industrial accident a blackout or a terrorist attack or war our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time even if our employees are able to report to work they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

torchmark and its subsidiaries in common with the insurance industry in general are subject to litigation including claims involving tax matters alleged breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmark’s subsidiaries employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on torchmark’s financial condition future operating results or liquidity however assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forwardlooking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges juries and appellate courts in the future this bespeaks caution particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as alabama and mississippi torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business particularly alabama and mississippi creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit 

  

as previously disclosed in filings with the securities and exchange commission sec united american was named as a defendant in purported class action litigation originally filed on september 16 2004 in the circuit court of saline county arkansas on behalf of the arkansas purchasers of association group health insurance policies or certificates issued by united american through heartland alliance of america association and farm  ranch healthcare inc  smith and ivie v collingsworth et al cv20047422 the plaintiffs asserted claims for fraudulent concealment breach of contract common law liability for nondisclosure breach of fiduciary duties civil conspiracy unjust enrichment violation of the arkansas deceptive trade practices act and violation of arkansas law and the rules and regulations of the arkansas insurance department declaratory injunctive and equitable relief as well as actual and punitive damages were sought by the plaintiffs on september 7 2005 the plaintiffs amended their complaint to assert a nationwide class defined as all united american insureds who simultaneously purchased both an individual hospital and surgical expense health insurance policy form hsxc and an individual supplemental term life insurance policy form rt85 from farm  ranch through heartland

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

discontinued operations as described in note 3—discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our subsidiary united investors life insurance company united investors as of december 31 2010 because of the sale united investors’ financial results are excluded from this discussion since those operations are discontinued 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and to a limited extent annuities to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the major insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully described in note 14 — business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and benefit administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is 

  

net investment income 

less 

interest credited to net policy liabilities 

financing costs 

  

the tables in note 14 — business segments reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ending december 31 2011 additionally this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates yeartoyear comparability and which reconciles to net income that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations net income increased slightly from 517 million to 518 million in 2011 it rose 28 or 112 million in 2010 largely as a result of aftertax realized investment gains of 24 million in 2010 compared with losses of 85 million after tax in 2009 the 2009 losses included 94 million of write downs of fixed maturities which were determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired realized investment gains were 17 million in 2011 on a diluted per share basis 2011 net income increased 12 to 472 after an increase in 2010 of 29 to 420the abovementioned aftertax realized investment gains added 15 to 2011 net income per diluted share and 20 per share in 2010 while the 2009 loss reduced net income 69 per share of which the impairment writedowns accounted for 76 of the loss more information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses in this report where there is a more complete discussion also as explained in note 14—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments also included in 2010 results is a 35 million after tax loss on the disposal of united investors representing 28 per diluted share 

  

as shown in the above chart after tax segment operations before discontinued operations rose each year over the prior year from 469 million in 2009 to 498 million in 2010 to 514 million in 2011 the primary contributor to the growth in both 2011 and 2010 was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment which margins rose 31 million in 2011 and 28 million in 2010 the life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented growth in 2010 was also affected positively by the 21 million increased contribution of excess investment income the measure of profitability of the investment segment excess investment income in 2010 increased over 2009 investment segment income largely because of the unusually large holdings in lowyielding cash and shortterm investments held in 2009 due to the uncertain economic climate at that time these shortterm holdings were invested in 2010 as financial conditions improved excess investment income was also negatively affected in 2009 because of our issuance of a 300 million 9 1  4  

  

debt security in june 2009 net proceeds of 296 million and repayment of a 99 million 8 1  4  security which matured in august 2009 these transactions resulted in a net increase in our financing costs in 2009 and reduced excess investment income growth in 2011 earnings was negatively affected by a decline in the health insurance segment underwriting margin of 8 million and a 5 million decline in excess investment income from the investment segment the 2011 decline in health contribution was largely a result of the discontinuance of sales of certain limitedbenefit health insurance products because of healthcare reform the decline in excess investment income was due to the continuing lowinterest rate environment which has pressured investment yields and spreads over policy benefit requirements discussed more fully under the captain investments in this report 

  

total revenues were flat in 2011 at 338 billion compared with 337 billion in 2010 revenues increased 8 in 2010 over revenues of 312 billion in 2009 life premium rose 4 or 63 million in 2011 and 72 million in 2010 net investment income rose 2 or 17 million in 2011 compared with 44 million in 2010 however growth in revenues in 2011 and 2010 were negatively affected by the declines in health premium described further under this caption 

  

while life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december 31 2011 margins as a percentage of premium rose in 2011 to 28 from 27 in 2010 and 2009 segment profits for life insurance were not only positively affected by the premium growth but also by improvements in mortality and persistency in both periods life net sales declined 1 in 2011 to 325 million but rose 1 in 2010 to 330 million life insurance segment results are discussed further in this report under the caption life insurance 

  

we primarily market two health insurance products medicare supplement insurance and the medicare part d prescription drug benefit we also market limitedbenefit cancer and accident health products and prior to september 2010 an underage65 limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical product health premium declined 6 in 2011 to 929 million from 987 million in 2010 health premium declined 3 in 2010 the decreases in both years were caused primarily by the deemphasis and discontinuance of sales in 2010 of our limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical health product declines in agent counts in the distribution units that market our health products were another negative factor these factors have caused reductions in net sales of health products which have in turn pressured premium growth medicare supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium but increased competition has also dampened sales of this product in recent years resulting in premium declines in each successive year our medicare part d premium declined 6 in 2011 after having increased 14 in 2010 however enrollees into our medicare part d program for the plan year 2012 were 225 thousand an increase of 56 over the 2011 enrollees therefore we expect premium growth in 2012 at approximately the same rate see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

  

we offer fixed annuities but we do not emphasize sales of annuity products favoring life insurance instead with the sale of united investors in 2010 we disposed of 37 of our annuity deposit balance see the caption annuities for further discussion of the annuity segment 

  

as previously mentioned the investment segment’s pretax profitability or excess investment income increased 21 million in 2010 but declined 5 million in 2011 profitability in this segment is based on three major components net investment income required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to insurance products and financing costs in recent years growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio one reason that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of also there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested in which the funds are held in cash growth in total investment income has also been somewhat negatively affected by torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments in 2011 net investment rose 3 while the portfolio at amortized cost grew 4 in accordance with the general pattern in recent periods however in 2010 the growth in net investment income slightly exceeded the growth in the average portfolio for the first time in many years primarily as a result of the special constraints on the growth in 2009 net investment income during 2009 due primarily to uncertainty 

  

about liquidity in the financial markets we held significantly more cash and short term investments than we normally would additionally in 2009 we sold a significant portion of higheryielding but lowerrated fixed maturities and reinvested the proceeds in loweryielding but higherrated bonds in 2009 and early 2010 to improve our riskadjusted return these factors contributed to reduced 2009 net investment income 

  

the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets the lower newmoney yields resulting from the lowinterestrate environment noted above have had the effect of compressing excess investment income as required interest has grown we have implemented certain strategies to offset this effect including lowering the discount rate going forward and increasing premium rates on sales of new products financing costs which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and shortterm debt are also deducted from net investment income financing costs in 2011 were 78 million an increase of 3 over 75 million in 2010 this increase was primarily a result of increased charges related to our letters of credit facility in 2010 financing costs increased 8 as interest expense on our longterm debt rose 9 million or 13 as noted earlier in 2009 we issued our 300 million 9 1  4  senior notes but repaid our 99 million 8 1  4  senior debentures resulting in a higher balance of debt outstanding at a higher interest rate in 2010 

  

torchmark’s current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investmentgrade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives approximately 96 of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which 95 were investment grade at december 31 2011 the average quality rating of the portfolio was a the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alta mortgages no direct investment in residential mortgages no direct investment in european sovereign debt no counterparty risks no credit default swaps or derivative contracts see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and n ote 4—investments in the notes to consolidated statements of operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment 

  

as mentioned earlier we used a portion of the 296 million proceeds from the offering of our 9 1  4  senior notes 300 million par amount in 2009 to repay our 99 million 8 1  4  senior debentures which also matured in 2009 more information on these transactions can be found in note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 

  

in each of the years 2011 and 2009 income from continuing operations was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring nonoperating items we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations as reported in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption settlements  we have been involved in certain issues in 2011 or 2009 in which we either received settlements or incurred settlement losses and expenses in 2011 we settled a state administrative matter in the pretax amount of 69 million 45 million after tax and accrued an estimated liability for a litigation settlement expected to settle in early 2012 in the pretax amount of 120 million 78 million after tax both of these issues involved matters arising many years ago additionally as described under the same caption of note 1 we received a tax settlement in the amount of 29 million in 2009 the tax settlement primarily involved the results of prior year examinations the state administrative settlement and the litigation accrual are included in “other operating expense” and the tax settlement is an adjustment to “income taxes” in the consolidated statements of operations  however as described in note 1  we remove items such as these that are concerned with prior periods when evaluating the results of current operations and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods 

  

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these 

  

purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises due to poor economic conditions we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2009 however in the first quarter of 2010 the board of directors reactivated the company’s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management in consultation with the board determines to be in the best interest of the company the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december 31 2011 retroactively restated for the threefortwo stock split described in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements

option proceeds increased significantly in 2011 due to optionholders exercising several years of option grants that are due to expire in 2012 

  

throughout the remainder of this discussion share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings 

  

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows the following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations as described in note 14—business segments  

  

life insurance life insurance is our largest insurance segment with 2011 life premium representing 65 of total premium life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 75 of the total in 2011 additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

we completed the process of combining selected united american ua exclusive agency branch offices with the liberty national exclusive agency during 2011 for this reason all data will be reported on a combined basis in this report 

  

life insurance premium rose 4 to 173 billion in 2011 after having increased 5 in 2010 to 166 billion life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows 

  

life insurance 

premium by distribution method 

dollar amounts in thousands 

 

   

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue net sales is annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

  

annualized life premium in force was 181 billion at december 31 2011 an increase of 3 over 175 billion a year earlier annualized life premium in force was 169 billion at december 31 2009

the american income exclusive agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions but also on credit unions and other associations as well as referrals from new customers for its life insurance sales it is torchmark’s highest profit margin business the american income agency was also the largest contributor to life premium and net sales of any torchmark distribution method in 2011 life premium for this agency rose 8 to 608 million in 2011 after having increased 10 in 2010 net sales increased 3 in 2011 to 142 million after having risen 8 in 2010 net sales rose 18 in 2009 firstyear collected premium rose 2 in 2011 to 113 million after having increased 16 in 2010 the average face amount of policies issued in 2011 was approximately 34 thousand as in the case of all of torchmark’s agency distribution systems continued increases in product sales are largely 

  

dependent on increases in agent count the american income agent count was 4381 at december 31 2011 compared with 3912 a year earlier an increase of 12 however the agent count had declined 6 in 2010 from 4154 a year earlier this agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business additionally the systematic centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruitment of new agents 

  

direct response consists of two primary components insert media and direct mail insert media targets primarily the adult market it involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media such as coupon packets newspapers bank statements and billings direct mail focuses primarily on young middleincome households with children the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product for this group not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time at this time we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response’s premier markets 

  

the direct response operation accounted for 34 of our life insurance premium during 2011 increasing 5 over 2010 premium life premium for this channel rose 6 in 2010 and 5 in 2009 net sales were flat in 2011 after a 4 increase in 2010 to 137 million firstyear collected premium declined 1 to 89 million in 2011 after a 6 gain in 2010 the average face amount of policies issued in 2011 was approximately 20 thousand 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency markets primarily life insurance and supplemental health insurance focusing primarily on middleincome customers life premium income for this agency was 288 million in 2011 a 2 decrease compared with 295 million in 2010 life premium for this agency declined 1 in 2010 from 2009 firstyear collected premium declined 10 to 31 million in 2011 after having also declined 1 in 2010 the average face amount of policies issued in 2011 was approximately 25 thousand 

  

the liberty agency’s net sales declined 19 to 36 million in 2011 after also having declined 19 a year earlier as noted above in the case of all of our agencies the size of the agency drives product sales this agency had 1345 producing agents at december 31 2011 compared with 2001 a year earlier a decline of 33 the agent count at liberty had also declined 19 in 2010 from 2471 the decrease in agent count has been due in part to the closing of several offices which had low production in addition agent compensation issues that arose in 2009 have negatively impacted agent counts the bonus thresholds proved more difficult for producing agents to meet than anticipated management reduced the bonus threshold later in 2009 also due to deteriorating firstyear persistency management modified compensation incentives in 2009 to place more emphasis on the persistency of newly issued policies these changes resulted in the departure of a number of the less productive agents in 2010 and 2011 while these modifications caused a loss of agents they resulted in improved persistency and margins and contributed to torchmark’s overall improvement in life insurance margins 

  

the liberty exclusive agency agent counts have also decreased due to issues related to its health insurance business this agency’s health insurance marketing efforts had historically been focused on limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical plans these plans were subject to intense competition from other companies which offered lowermargin products providing agents with products that were easier to sell thus discouraging sales of our products and ultimately resulting in decreases in agent counts in addition these limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments sales of these limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical plans were discontinued after september 2010 these developments caused further increases in agent turnover in response the agency has shifted its marketing focus to a product mix more weighted towards life insurance and supplemental health insurance products not affected by healthcare reform that have higher margins and persistency additionally we are in the process of changing the cost structure of this agency to a more commissiondriven model going forward branch office operating expenses will be the responsibility of the branch managers and all new agent recruits will be independent contractors rather than employees we are also implementing new agent recruiting and training programs similar to those used at american income we believe these changes will increase the agency’s profitability and stability in the long run 

  

we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the military agency the united american independent agency and other small miscellaneous sales agencies the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of wholelife products with term insurance riders military premium represented 11 of life premium at december 31 2011 the united american independent agency represented approximately 1 of torchmark’s total life premium at that date this agency is focused on health insurance with life sales being incidental

health insurance health insurance sold by torchmark includes primarily medicare supplement and part d prescription drug coverage to enrollees in the federal medicare program cancer coverage and accident coverage all health coverage plans other than medicare supplement and part d are classified here as limitedbenefit plans for several years our primary health insurance product had been limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical plans however as previously discussed under the caption life insurance  these plans became subject to intense competition which resulted in decreasing agent counts most notably in the liberty national exclusive agency but also in the ua independent agency in addition these plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments these factors contributed to the company’s decisions to discontinue the marketing of these limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical products after september 2010 we do continue to market the limitedbenefit cancer and accident products since 2009 medicare supplement sales have exceeded those of the limitedbenefit products and represented 59 of health net sales exclusive of medicare part d in 2011 medicare supplement sales have been stronger than limitedbenefit sales due in part to changes in agent counts in our health distribution groups discussed below 

  

total health premium represented 35 of torchmark’s total premium income in 2011 excluding part d premium health premium represented 28 of total premium income in 2011 compared with 29 in 2010 and 32 in 2009 health underwriting margin excluding part d accounted for 21 of the total in 2011 compared with 23 in 2010 and 25 in 2009 these declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment health results have also been affected by the discontinuance of sales of the previouslymentioned health products the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years

health insurance excluding medicare part d health premium other than part d has declined in each successive year presented falling 6 in 2011 to 734 million and 7 in 2010 net sales decreased 1 in 2011 to 64 million after a decline of 33 in 2010 firstyear collected premium has also declined in each period considered these declines in sales and premium resulted from several factors 1 our previouslymentioned emphasis on life sales due to life’s superior margins and its greater contribution to investment income 2 the discontinuance of sales of various limitedbenefit health products and 3 the decline in agent counts in certain distribution units that market health products 

  

  

medicare supplement provides the greatest amount of health premium partially because medicare supplement products are generally more persistent than the limitedbenefit products but also because of more stable sales in recent periods medicare supplement premium also continues to grow in relation to our limitedbenefit health premium medicare supplement premium represented 60 of nonpart d health premium in 2011 compared with 58 in 2010 and 55 in 2009 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency represented 39 of all torchmark nonpart d health premium income at 290 million in 2011 the liberty agency markets medicare supplements and limitedbenefit health products consisting primarily of cancer insurance in 2011 health premium income in this agency declined 12 from prior year premium of 331 million premium also fell 15 in 2010 from 389 million firstyear collected premium declined 20 to 13 million in 2011 after declining 52 a year earlier as noted earlier the discontinuance of sales of certain health products and the earlier increased competition in the health insurance market had caused steep declines in the agent count in this agency as of december 31 2011 this agency had 1345 agents a decline of 33 from the 2010 year end count of 2001 in 2010 the number of agents fell 19 from 2471 at year end 2009 the decline in agent counts has resulted in decreased new sales translating into declines in premium net sales for 2011 rose 19 from 14 million in 2010 to 17 million due to the introduction of new products in 2010 this agency’s net sales fell 52 also discussed under the life insurance caption are efforts designed to strengthen this agency 

  

the ua independent agency is torchmark’s largest in terms of health premium income this agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large multistate organizations down to oneperson offices all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies torchmark had 1447 active producing agents at december 31 2011 compared with 1406 a year earlier this agency is our largest distributor of nonpart d health insurance in terms of health net sales representing 51 in 2011 this agency is also our largest producer of medicare supplement insurance with 270 million or 61 of our medicare supplement premium income in 2011 net sales for this agency increased 2 to 33 million in 2011 after having declined 25 in 2010 from 43 million in 2009 the greater amount of net sales in 2009 were due to increases in group medicare supplement sales group medicare supplement sales fluctuate greatly from period to period and do not indicate a trend total health premium income for the ua independent agency was 306 million in 2011 a 3 decline from 2010 premium of 315 million premium income also declined 4 in 2010 these declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses 

  

the american income exclusive agency predominantly a life insurance distribution channel is our third largest health insurance distributor based on premium income its health plans are comprised of various limitedbenefit plans approximately 69 of the agency’s 2011 health premium was from accident policies sales of the plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 

  

health premium at this agency rose 1 in 2011 to 80 million after having increased 5 to 79 million in 2010 however net health sales declined 27 to 10 million in 2011 net sales were 13 million in both 2010 and 2009 net health sales comprised only 6 of the american income agency’s total net sales in 2011 

  

direct response  primarily a life operation also offers health insurance which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups in both 2011 and 2010 net health sales were 5 million in 2011 net health sales for this group represented approximately 4 of direct response’s total life and health net sales direct response health premium income has risen each year over the prior year health premium rose 5 in 2011 to 57 million and 17 in 2010 

  

medicare part d torchmark through its subsidiary united american offers coverage under the government’s medicare part d plan the medicare part d plan is a standalone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american under part d private carriers are the primary insurers while cms provides significant premium subsidies and reinsurance total medicare part d premium was 197 million in 2011 compared with 209 million in 2010 a decline of 6 part d premium rose 14 in 2010 changes in part d premium generally result from changes in the number of 

  

enrollees at december 31 2011 united american had approximately 225 thousand enrollees for the 2012 part d plan compared with 144 thousand for the 2011 plan year and 158 thousand for the 2010 plan year growth for the plan year 2012 was largely a result of a new lower cost part d plan which allowed us to pick up a large number of lowincome automatic enrollees and to grow our own individual sales the new product is priced to achieve the same underwriting margin as our existing product our medicare part d product is sold through the direct response operation and to groups through the ua independent agency part d net sales were 115 million in 2011 compared with 39 million in 2010 and 43 million in 2009 we count only sales to new firsttime enrollees in net sales and the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees 

  

we believe that the medicare part d program is a meaningful component of our health product offerings because of our experience with the seniorage market and with medicare supplements the government assurances with regard to the risksharing agreements for participating insurers limitedrisk due to the incremental income added to our health insurance margins and the renewal of the business every year due to our experience with service to the seniorage market and the use of our existing direct response marketing system entry to this business required little new investment however as with any governmentsponsored program the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market 

  

as presented in the following table torchmark’s health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense declined 5 in 2011 to 162 million but remained flat at 170 million in 2010 as a percentage of premium income margins were stable in all periods at approximately 17

annuities as described in note 3—discontinued operations  we sold our subsidiary united investors united investors was our carrier of variable annuities and a primary carrier of fixed annuities as a result of the sale we disposed of approximately 37 of our annuity deposit balance as of december 31 2010 including all of our variable annuities accordingly we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward 

  

our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2011 2010 and 2009 were 129 billion 124 billion and 959 million respectively underwriting income was 23 million 13 million and 32 thousand in each of the years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

while the fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year policy charges and underwriting income have fluctuated only modestly the stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist primarily of surrender charges and are not based on account size these charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements which can result in negative net policy obligations in each of the years presented the spreads for fixed annuities increased over the prior year as a result of credited rate reductions on the inforce annuities furthermore spreads were increased by the introduction of a new annuity form on liberty national paper in mid2009 the amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits 

  

administrative expenses operating expenses are included in the other and corporate segments and are classified into two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company the following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2011 

  

operating expenses selected information 

dollar amounts in thousands 

 

   

insurance administrative expenses have trended upwards and rose 2 in 2011 after having increased 4 in 2010 as a percentage of premium they increased 1 in each successive year to 60 in 2011 employee costs increased 25 in 2010 primarily as a result of unusually high employee health insurance costs in that year partially offsetting the increase in 2010 employee costs was a decline in legal costs as we favorably settled certain previously reserved litigation during 2010 in 2011 however legal expenses returned to normal levels expenses for 2011 correlated more closely by expense component to 2009 expenses as 2010 expenses reflected the aforementioned unusual items parent company expense declined in 2011 primarily as a result of the decline in certain employee benefit liabilities related to retired employees stock compensation expense has risen in each successive year as the value of torchmark stock has increased resulting in higher values for grants of stock and options as stated in note 14—business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 

  

as mentioned in note 1— significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we incurred two settlement expense issues in 2011 that related to events occurring many years ago the settlement of a state administrative issue of 7 million and a litigation issue in the estimated amount of 12 million in addition to these two items we recorded two nonrecurring charges in 2011 we sold aviation equipment at a loss of 979 thousand and in 2009 we wrote down companyoccupied real estate that was otherthantemporarily impaired in the amount of 355 thousand while these nonrecurring expenses were included in “operating expenses” for the respective year in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with accounting guidance they are considered as nonoperating expenses by management 

  

investments we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14— business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used over 5 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

 

  

     

excess investment income declined 5 million or 2 in 2011 from the prior year excess investment income rose 21 million or 8 in 2010 on a per diluted share basis excess investment income rose 10 to 266 per share in 2011 after having risen 9 in the prior year the favorable increases in the per share amounts relative to the changes in dollar amounts for excess investment income are a result of share purchases 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income which rose 3 to 707 million in 2011 it increased 8 to 685 million in 2010 from 632 million in 2009 presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets 

 

   

growth in net investment income generally correlates somewhat with the growth in mean invested assets at amortized cost with the exception of the years 2009 and 2010 growth in investment income has slightly lagged the growth in mean assets for several years one of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower rate than the growth in mean invested assets in recent years is due to the lowinterestrate environment during that period as a result new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of another factor that has contributed to the relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested during these lags we have held cash at lower yields during 2009 because of the uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets we held significantly more cash and shortterm investments than in other years holding this larger balance of lowyielding securities in 2009 resulted in the extremely low growth rate in income in that year and also affected the higher growth rate in 2010 as these lower yielding cash balances were invested in 2010 the trend of lags in growth in net investment income in relation to the growth in mean invested assets is expected to continue until yields on suitable new investments exceed the portfolio yield 

  

excess investment income is reduced by required interest on net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 

  

required interest on net insurance policy liabilities

the combined average interest discount rate has risen in each of the last three years due to changes in the mix of the in force business for more specific information on life and health discount rates please refer to note 6—future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs 

  

the table below presents the components of financing costs 

  

analysis of financing costs 

amounts in thousands 

 

  

   

financing costs increased 2 million or 3 in 2011 they rose 6 million or 8 in 2010 the increase in financing costs in 2010 reflects the issuance in june 2009 of 300 million principal amount 9¼ senior notes due in 2019 in 2010 we incurred a full year of interest on this issue the 2011 increase in interest on shortterm debt was primarily a result of the 21 million increase in financing charges on our letter of credit facility arising from the december 2010 restructuring of our credit facility more information on this facility is disclosed under the caption shortterm borrowings in the financial condition section of this report and in note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the 2010 decrease was due to a decline in shortterm rates over the previous year but was also impacted by a 22 decline in the average balance of commercial paper outstanding compared with 2009 

  

excess investment income benefits from increases in longterm rates available on new investments and decreases in shortterm borrowing rates of these two factors higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at shortterm rates 

  

however growth in our excess investment income decreases when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs such as we have experienced in recent periods in an extended lowinterestrate environment the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower longterm rates we believe however the decline would be relatively slow as only 2 to 3 of fixed maturities on average are expected to run off each year over the next five years we also believe that the deferred acquisition costs and benefit reserve balances on our life and health business would not be impacted by an extended lowinterestrate environment while these balances for annuities could be affected the impact would be immaterial 

  

in response to the lower interest rates we raised the new business premium rates on certain life products the increased premiums will provide additional margin on these policies to help offset the possible future reductions in excess investment income and are not expected to have a detrimental impact on sales 

  

investment acquisitions  torchmark’s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investmentgrade fixed maturities generally with long maturities maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date that meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities further we believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable if such longerterm securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives we consider investing in shortterm securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time during calendar years 2009 through 2011 torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities primarily with longerterm maturities as presented in the chart below 

  

the following table summarizes selected information for fixedmaturity purchases the effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield this date is commonly known as the “worst call date” two different average life calculations are shown average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date

we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment however the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart the average life of funds invested in 2009 to both next call and maturity was lower than that of funds invested during 2011 and 2010 due to actions taken for statutory capital management purposes and the limited availability of longer term investments 

  

during the three years 2009 through 2011 we have invested primarily in investmentgrade corporate bonds purchases in 2011 were almost entirely in these corporates during 2009 and 2010 we acquired a significant amount of taxable municipal bonds primarily build america bonds authorized by the american recovery and retirement act of 2009 the investments in these municipal bonds consisted almost exclusively of general obligation bonds and revenue bonds for essential services in assessing the creditworthiness of these bonds we took into account a number of factors including the geographic location of the municipalities 

  

new cash flow available for investment is primarily provided through our insurance operations but has also been affected by other factors issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past three years are a factor issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost calls increase funds available for investment 

  

but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called issuer calls were 187 million in 2011 109 million in 2010 and 181 million in 2009 the higher level of acquisitions in 2009 was primarily due to the additional cash flow available from the special sales transactions noted below 

  

sales transactions during 2009 the company sold 703 million of fixed maturities at amortized cost including 293 million of below investmentgrade securities the market value for some of these securities increased significantly during the period to a level where even though the sales price was less than amortized cost management determined that better riskadjusted returns could be achieved by selling rather than continuing to hold the securities other securities were sold at prices that produced gains to offset these losses for tax purposes due in large part to selling belowinvestmentgrade securities and reinvesting the proceeds in investmentgrade securities belowinvestmentgrade securities declined significantly as a percentage of total fixed maturities at year end 2009 the reduction in belowinvestmentgrade securities had a positive impact on the riskbased capital position of our insurance subsidiaries at that date and thereafter 

  

portfolio analysis because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms the following table presents a comparison of torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2011 with the latest industry data 

 

   

at december 31 2011 approximately 95 of our investments at book value were in a diversified fixedmaturity portfolio policy loans which are secured by policy cash values made up an additional 4 the remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities mortgage loans and other longterm and shortterm investments 

  

because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities an analysis of our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 is as follows

at december 31 2011 fixed maturities had a fair value of 119 billion compared with 105 billion at december 31 2010 at december 31 2011 fixed maturities were in a 964 million net unrealized gain position compared with an unrealized gain position of 108 million at december 31 2010 approximately 77 of our fixed maturity assets at december 31 2011 at amortized cost were corporate bonds and 11 were redeemable preferred stocks this compares with 74 corporate bonds and 13 redeemable preferred stocks at year end 2010 on a combined basis residential mortgagebacked securities other assetbacked securities and collateralized debt obligations cdos were less than 2 of the assets at amortized cost at december 31 2011 the 60 million of cdos at amortized cost made up less than 06 of the assets and are backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies the 14 million of residential mortgagebacked securities are rated aaa for more information about our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2011 and 2010 including an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities see note 4—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

due to the strong and stable cash flows generated by its insurance products torchmark has the ability to hold securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery even though these fixed maturity investments are available for sale torchmark generally expects and intends to hold to maturity any securities which are temporarily impaired 

  

additional information concerning the fixedmaturity portfolio is as follows 

  

fixed maturity portfolio selected information 

 

   

credit risk sensitivity credit risk is the level of certainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity approximately 88 of our fixedmaturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities including redeemable preferred and assetbacked securities as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities credit risk is a concern we mitigate this ongoing risk in part by acquiring only investmentgrade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis we also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors 

  

the following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at december 31 2011 

 

   

at december 31 2011 approximately 32 of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost 31 at fair value were in the financial sector including 16 in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 12 in banks at amortized cost financial guarantors mortgage insurers and insurance brokers comprised approximately 4 of the portfolio after financials the next largest sector was utilities which comprised 16 of the portfolio at amortized cost the balance of the portfolio is spread among 262 issuers in a wide variety of sectors as previously noted gross unrealized losses were 239 million at december 31 2011 declining from 368 million a year earlier the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of 964 million at december 31 2011 

  

as shown in the table above the ratio of gross unrealized losses to book value was approximately 50 for our investments in cdos as previously noted cdos represented less than 06 of our fixed maturity investments at december 31 2011 we evaluated each of the impaired securities in this and all other sectors to determine whether or not any of the impairments were otherthantemporary our portfolio consisted of five cdo investments at december 31 2011 in which three were carried at a value of 0 one was considered only temporarily impaired and one was previously considered otherthantemporarily impaired 

  

the cdo considered temporarily impaired was carried at an amortized cost of 234 million and had a fair value of 77 million the cdo considered otherthantemporarily impaired was previously written down and carried at an amortized cost of 370 million based on the present value of expected cash flows at the original purchase yield this cdo had a fair value of 227 million at december 31 2011 the collateral underlying these cdos is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies and no subprime or alta mortgages are included in the collateral 

  

in reaching these conclusions concerning the otherthantemporary impairment of our cdos we reviewed and discussed with the collateral managers of each of these cdos the current status of the collateral underlying our investments the credit events defaults and deferrals in underlying collateral experienced to date and the possibility of future credit events we calculated expected future cash flows using assumptions for expected future credit events that reflect actual historical experience and expected future experience we reviewed the actual versus expected cash flows received to date and the impact that potential future credit events could have on our expected future cash flows we calculated the magnitude of future credit events that could be experienced without negatively impacting the recovery of our investment and our expected yield rate while there is a possibility that future credit events will exceed our current expectations we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions 

  

an analysis of the fixedmaturity portfolio by a composite rating at december 31 2011 is shown in the table below 

  

fixed maturities by rating 

at december 31 2011 

dollar amounts in millions 

 

   

the portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of a based on amortized cost approximately 93 of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by subprime or alta mortgages loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower we have no direct investments in residential mortgages nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts we do not participate in securities lending there are no offbalance sheet investments as all investments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets  we have no direct exposure to european sovereign debt 

  

our current investment policy is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

an analysis of changes in belowinvestment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost is as follows 

 

  

market risk sensitivity torchmark’s financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since 96 of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixedmaturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixedrate investments the portfolio is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value under normal market conditions we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however in accordance with gaap these liabilities are not marked to market 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2011 and 2010 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points 

 

   

realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits we also incur acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses occur only incidentally usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the periodtoperiod trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results 

  

the following table summarizes our taxeffected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2011

as described in note 4— investments under the caption otherthan temporary impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we wrote certain securities down to fair value during each year 2009 through 2011 as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in note 4 and in our critical accounting policies in this report the writedowns resulted in pretax charges of 20 thousand in 2011 13 thousand after tax 5 million in 2010 3 million after tax and 143 million in 2009 94 million after tax the 2009 charge included 83 million on cdos 55 million after tax and 24 million on monoline financial guarantors and mortgage insurers 16 million after tax the remaining writedowns in 2009 were from losses on a variety of corporate bonds in 2010 we acquired 73 million book value of our 9 1  4  senior notes at a cost of 89 million resulting in an aftertax loss on debt redemption of 11 million 

  

financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

insurance subsidiary liquidity the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes the funds to provide for policy benefits the majority of which are paid in future periods are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities to meet these longterm obligations in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restriction the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains the leading source of the excess cash is investment income however due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control a significant portion of the excess cash comes from underwriting income 

  

parent company liquidity cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt operating expenses of the parent and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders in 2011 the parent received 790 million of dividends and transfers from its insurance subsidiaries as compared with 401 million in 2010 and 392 million in 2009 the 2011 dividend included 305 million of additional dividends available as a result of the sale of united investors after paying debt obligations shareholder dividends and other expenses but before share repurchases torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in 2011 of approximately 672 million including the 305 million from the sale of united investors parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases in 2012 it is expected that the parent company will receive approximately 470 million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries and that approximately 360 million will be available as excess cash flow certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 12 — shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company as additional liquidity the parent held 27 million of cash and shortterm investments at december 31 2011 compared with 63 million a year earlier the parent also had available a 51 million receivable from subsidiaries at december 31 2011 

  

shortterm borrowings an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 600 million as of december 31 2011 we had available 177 million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility as compared with 203 million a year earlier for detailed information about this line of credit facility see the commercial paper section of note 11 — debt  

  

the following table presents certain information about our shortterm borrowings all of which was commercial paper 

  

shortterm borrowings—commercial paper 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market under this facility during the three years ended december 31 2011 

  

in summary torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2012 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of additional debt a shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing 

  

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were 859 million in 2011 compared with 103 billion in 2010 and 976 million in 2009 in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies have received 230 million in investment calls and tenders and 180 million of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2011 maturities tenders and calls totaled 639 million in 2010 and 761 million in 2009 

  

our cash and shortterm investments were 105 million at yearend 2011 and 582 million at yearend 2010 included in cash at december 31 2010 was the 343 million of proceeds received from the sale of united investors on that date additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 119 billion at december 31 2011 however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as described in note 11 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt torchmark had outstanding 120 million par amount 71 trust preferred securities at both december 31 2011 and 2010 the capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders as described in note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders the trust is an offbalance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest while these liabilities are not on our consolidated balance sheets  they are represented by torchmark’s 71 junior subordinated debentures due to the trust in the amount of 124 million which is on our balance sheets at both december 31 2011 and 2010 the 71 preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our 71 interest payment on our debt to the trusts 

  

as a part of its abovementioned credit facility torchmark had outstanding 198 million in standby letters of credit at december 31 2011 however these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole 

  

as of december 31 2011 we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of thirdparty entities other than as described above all of our guarantees other than the trust preferred guarantee were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 15 — commitments and contingencies 

  

the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december 31 2011 

  

amounts in millions 

 

  

      

capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in note 11 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements longterm funded debt junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities and shareholders’ equity the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark’s capital trust iii which is liable for its trust preferred securities in accordance with gaap these instruments are included in “due to affiliates” on the consolidated balance sheets a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

the carrying value of the funded debt was  914 million at december 31 2011 compared with 913 million a year earlier as fully explained in note 11—debt  we issued 300 million principal amount of 9¼ senior notes due in 2019 in june of 2009 for proceeds of 296 million a portion of these proceeds were used to repay the 99 million due upon the august 2009 maturity of our 8¼ senior debentures in addition we also used 175 million to strengthen the capital position of certain of our insurance subsidiaries in 2009 in the form of capital contributions and surplus notes the regulatory capital positions of these subsidiaries had been negatively affected by ratingagency downgrades of bonds in their investment portfolios the subsidiaries in turn invested these funds in investmentgrade fixed maturities 

  

our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 325 of required regulatory capital under riskbased capital rbc a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital the 325 target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows the relatively low risk of their product mix and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark at december 31 2011 our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had rbc ratios of approximately 336 should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future that cause the ratio to fall below 325 management has more than sufficient liquidity at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 325 

  

as noted under the caption summary of operations in this report we reactivated our share repurchase program during the first quarter of 2010 we previously had suspended the program indefinitely in march 2009 due to general economic conditions at that time however since reactivation we have made share purchases each quarter of 2010 and 2011 under this program we acquired 19 million shares at a cost of 788 million in 2011 average of 4168 per share 6 million shares for 204 million in 2010 and 3 million shares for 47 million in 2009 the majority of purchased shares are retired each year please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption summary of operations in this report 

  

torchmark has recently increased the dividend on its common shares in the first quarter of 2010 the dividend was increased from 0933 per share to 10 per share and in the fourth quarter of 2010 it was further increased to 1067 per share in the second quarter of 2011 it was again raised to 12 per share 

  

shareholders’ equity was 42 billion at december 31 2011 compared with 40 billion at december 31 2010 during the twelve months since december 31 2010 shareholders’ equity was reduced by the 788 million in share purchases under the repurchase program and another 185 million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises but has been increased by the 518 million of net income and by after tax unrealized gains of 538 million in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved 

  

we plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future but we will be cautious in doing so excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in fixed maturities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies 

  

we maintain a significant availableforsale fixedmaturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets while invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets from time to time the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity because of the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  

selected financial data 

 

  

     

previously the fasb issued guidance which offered an option which if elected would permit us to value our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets  however unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our availableforsale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results therefore we have not elected this option 

  

torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 107 times in 2011 compared with 113 times in 2010 and 93 times in 2009 this timesinterestearned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pretax income from continuing operations and interest expense a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 

  

credit ratings  the chart below presents torchmark’s credit ratings as of december 31 2011 

 

   

during the three year period ended december 31 2011 each of the rating agencies revised the outlook for torchmark from stable to negative and then back to stable reasons cited for the negative outlook included increased risk in our investment portfolio tighter liquidity and reduced financial flexibility reasons cited for the revision back to a stable outlook included improved financial flexibility increased capital levels at the insurance subsidiaries the decrease in unrealized losses and strong operating performance 

  

the credit quality of torchmark’s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies during 2009 a m best downgraded our preferred stock from bbb to bbb also in 2009 fitch downgraded our senior debt from a to bbb two notches our preferred stock from a to bbb two notches and our commercial paper from f1 to f2 one notch fitch stated that the downgrades were a result of the weakness in the statutory capital position of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries brought on by the ratings downgrades of fixed maturity securities held in the subsidiaries’ investment portfolios they also expressed concern with the level of intercompany financing by the parent company from the subsidiaries the ongoing exposure to financial market turmoil and the expectation of continued investment deterioration going forward in january 2010 fitch further downgraded our preferred stock one notch to bbb at that time fitch downgraded over 200 hybrid securities issued by insurance industry entities as their assessments of these securities in our industry changed 

  

the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is also rated by standard  poor’s and a m best the following chart presents these ratings for our four largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2011 

 

   

am best states that it assigns an a superior rating to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 

  

the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard  poor’s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics differing only slightly from those rated higher the minus sign  shows the relative standing within the major rating category 

  

  

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries such punitive damage claims that are tried in alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined additionally it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

new unadopted accounting rules 

  

the fasb has issued new accounting guidance potentially applicable to torchmark effective in future periods 

  

policy acquisition costs asu 201026 this accounting guidance amends the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts in order to address the diversity in practice surrounding the capitalization and deferral of these costs this guidance will be effective for torchmark beginning january 1 2012 please refer to unadopted accounting guidance in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information concerning the effects of adoption 

  

comprehensive income asu 201105 under this guidance the components of comprehensive income must be presented as either 1 a continuous statement including the components of net income or 2 as two separate but consecutive statements an income statement followed by a comprehensive income statement this guidance is effective for us in interim and annual periods beginning in 2012 because we already present comprehensive income as contemplated by the second alternative this guidance should not result in any change 

  

fair value measurement and disclosure asu 201104 the primary purpose of this new guidance is to converge the measurement criteria and disclosures of fair value in us gaap with those of international accounting standards the measurement principles are generally consistent with current us gaap and are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements the guidance will require additional disclosures including expanded disclosures for fair value measurements categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and a requirement to disclose the level in the fair value hierarchy of items whose fair value is disclosed but not measured at fair value on the balance sheet the guidance is effective for us in calendar 2012 with early adoption prohibited 

  

goodwill impairment testing asu 201108 the issuance of this update permits an optional qualitative assessment in order to simplify how an entity tests its goodwill for impairment under this assessment if an entity concludes that a reporting units’ fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount it would not be required to perform any further impairment testing for that reporting unit otherwise the twostep impairment test under current guidance would be required for the reporting unit this new guidance lists factors to consider in making the qualitative assessment the revised guidance is applicable to us beginning in 2012 with early adoption permitted we do not expect this new guidance to impact the value of our goodwill only to modify the way we test for its impairment 

  

health insurer’s fees paid to the federal government asu 201106  private health insurance carriers will be required to pay a new fee to the federal government beginning in calendar year 2014 under the patient protection and affordable care act this guidance addresses questions about how to recognize and classify the fees basically requiring that it be expensed ratably throughout the year it is effective for torchmark beginning in the year 2014 because the majority of torchmark’s health products are excluded from the mandate the impact of adoption should be immaterial 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note 6 — future policy benefit reserves  

  

approximately 81 of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2011 were traditional insurance liabilities whereby the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies torchmark had no premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended december 31 2011 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales additionally the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as deferred acquisition costs as indicated in note 5 — deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

approximately 98 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2011 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2011 

  

the remaining 2 of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised as noted earlier in this report our variable annuity block was disposed of as of december 31 2010 revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31 2011 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability 

  

for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

  

valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to manage risk we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixedmaturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

at times the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixedmaturity investments is presented in note 4—investments under the caption fair value measurements  

  

impairment of investments we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value where fair value has declined below carrying value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an otherthantemporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies and note 4 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2011 our gross liability under these funded plans was 282 million but was offset by assets of 258 million 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected our discount rate rate of return on assets and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in note 9 — postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary 

  

based on more current information available to us note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies and other related data 

  

cautionary statements 

  

we caution readers regarding certain forwardlooking statements contained in the foregoing discussion and elsewhere in this document and in any other statements made by us or on our behalf whether or not in future filings with the securities and exchange commission any statement that is not a historical fact or that might otherwise be considered an opinion or projection concerning us or our business whether express or implied is meant as and should be considered a forwardlooking statement such statements represent our opinions concerning future operations strategies financial results or other developments 

  

forwardlooking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties many of which are beyond our control if these estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect the actual results may differ materially from the forwardlooking statements made on the basis of such estimates or assumptions whether or not actual results differ materially from forwardlooking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments which may be national in scope related to the insurance industry generally or applicable to torchmark specifically such events or developments could include but are not necessarily limited to

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management at torchmark corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis as a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting the company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls accordingly even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time 

  

management evaluated the company’s internal control over financial reporting and based on its assessment determined that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2011 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and shareholders of 

torchmark corporation 

mckinney texas 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of torchmark corporation and subsidiaries “torchmark” as of december 31 2011 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion torchmark maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2011 of torchmark and our report dated february 28 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

annuities 

  

annuity products offered include singlepremium and flexiblepremium deferred annuities annuities in each of the three years ending december 31 2010 comprised less than 1 of premium 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses all of which are generally based on company experience and on projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

  

index to financial statements underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

  

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis a list of the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in the financial statements  see note 6 — future policy benefit reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

  

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities fixed maturities represented 94 of total investments at fair value at december 31 2010  see note 4 — investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis  

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

index to financial statements risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in indiana nebraska and new york 

  

insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions 

  

personnel 

  

at the end of 2010 torchmark had 2224 employees and 1067 licensed employees under sales contracts

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a mature regulated industry populated by many firms we operate in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market the development maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical we compete for producing agents with other insurers primarily on the basis of our products and compensation adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical as our competitors seek to hire away our agents from time to time increased competition has led to a reduction in agents in our united american branch office agency and united american independent agency which have historically been our major health distribution channels in direct response continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits 

  

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations we serve primarily the middleincome market for individual protection life and health insurance and as a result we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of an economic downturn or otherwise then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether 

  

variations in expected to actual rates of mortality morbidity and persistency could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity and persistency as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test expectedtoactual results actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set accordingly we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income 

  

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products our ability to market these products and our competitive position a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways including the following limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products through our independent agencies 

  

rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings or an announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could have a material adverse effect on our operations including limiting our access to capital markets increasing the cost of debt 

  

index to financial statements impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries and making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

  

ratings reflect only the rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control in addition rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered the models changes to the models could impact the rating agencies’ judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

  

our life products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches labor union members and sales via direct response distribution the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales in recent years labor union membership has experienced minimal growth and has declined as a percentage of employed workers most of our direct response business is solicited either through direct mail or by insertion into other mail media for distribution significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business 

  

health insurance marketplace risks 

  

congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact our medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of our inforce health insurance business because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future the nature and timing of these changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business 

  

our medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers our medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senioraged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare such as health maintenance organizations hmos and other managed care or private plans the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance 

  

our medicare supplement and other health insurance business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales in recent years price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market as well as the market for other health products has been significant characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to underprice new sales in order to gain market share we have elected not to compete on those terms which has negatively affected sales should these industry practices continue it is likely that our sales of health insurance products will remain depressed 

  

an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success because medicare supplement policies are 

  

index to financial statements coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability 

  

investment risks 

  

our investments are subject to market and credit risks our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixedmaturity and shortterm investments a significant portion of our fixedmaturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels financial market performance disruptions in credit markets and general economic conditions as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer additionally because the majority of our investments are longerterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity significant increases in interest rates widening of credit spreads or inactive markets associated with market downturns could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable in that case the unrealized loss will be realized at which point we would take an impairment charge reducing our net income 

  

difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses difficult conditions in us capital markets in recent periods caused a notable increase in the troubled status of businesses in which we hold investments if difficulties within these businesses and industries increase there could be deferrals and defaults on amounts owed to us if conditions in the capital markets worsen we could experience credit downgrades or default events within our investment portfolio 

  

a default by an issuer could result in a significant otherthantemporary impairment of that investment causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income the risk of default is higher for bonds with longerterm maturities which we acquire in order to match our longterm insurance obligations we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment also while we have invested in a broad array of industries and issuers in order to attempt to maintain a highly diversified portfolio a significant amount of our investments is in banks insurance companies and other financial institutions which have experienced an increased level of downgrades in recent years moreover we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all material otherthantemporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus leading to lower riskbased capital ratios potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries while we intend to hold our investments until maturity a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income 

  

a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the rates credited to the net policy liabilities while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads significant 

  

index to financial statements decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

  

liquidity risks 

  

our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available primarily dividends from our insurance subsidiaries as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity for us also include a variety of short and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper and medium and longterm debt 

  

the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example in the states where our companies are domiciled an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of prior year statutory net income excluding capital gains on an annual noncumulative basis or 10 of prior year statutory surplus without regulatory approval accordingly a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations could reduce their capital or cash flow and as a result limit or disallow payment of dividends to us a principal source of our cash flow 

  

we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries although we do not anticipate changes changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses additionally the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock 

  

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital the capital and credit markets have recently experienced extreme instability and disruption for an extended period of time in some cases the markets exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain industries and issuers additionally should credit spreads widen again in the future the interest rate we must pay on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced if the credit and capital markets were to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities 

  

index to financial statements or rating agencies take negative actions against us our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility therefore as a result our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders not our investors state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising licensing agents policy forms capital adequacy solvency reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations which may change from time to time if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines 

  

we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives in recent years there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries by insurance regulatory authorities which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our agents or employees are improper these actions can result in substantial fines penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may even absent any particular regulatory authority’s interpretation of an issue changing cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to our practices that may in some cases limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business 

  

currently the us federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance however the doddfrank wall street record and consumer protection act of 2010 establishes a federal insurance office fio whose duties have not yet been defined within the department of the treasury and the patient protection affordable care act created the center for consumer information and insurance oversight cciio originally established under the department of health and human services and subsequently transferred to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the creation of these insurance regulatory offices may indicate that the federal government intends to play a larger role in the regulation of the insurance industry we cannot predict what impact if any the fio and cciio as well as any other proposals for federal regulation of insurance could have on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements and reduce our profitability our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are 

  

index to financial statements required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability 

  

if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries we are and in the future may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants and in certain of these matters the plaintiffs are seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis however the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states in which we operate juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit 

  

our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases the costs of settlement or judgments against us or changes in our operations that could result from litigation substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation which in turn could materially harm our business and our business prospects 

  

catastrophic event risk 

  

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality caused by events such as a pandemic an act of terrorism or another event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries across a wide geographic area these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and depending on their severity and geographic scope could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

  

the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total number of policyholders in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event pandemics hurricanes earthquakes and man 

  

index to financial statements made catastrophes including terrorism and war may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 

  

information technology risk 

  

the occurrence of computer viruses network security breaches disasters or other unanticipated events could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations a computer virus could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries destroying valuable data or making it difficult to conduct business in addition despite our implementation of network security measures our servers could be subject to physical and electronic breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 

  

we retain confidential information in our computer systems and rely on sophisticated commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access view misappropriate alter or delete information in the systems including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information in addition an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access use or disclosure of their information any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in inappropriate access use or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter people from purchasing our products subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical legal and other expenses 

  

in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an industrial accident a blackout or a terrorist attack or war our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time even if our employees are able to report to work they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

torchmark and its subsidiaries in common with the insurance industry in general are subject to litigation including claims involving tax matters alleged breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmark’s subsidiaries employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on torchmark’s financial condition future operating results or liquidity however assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forwardlooking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges juries and appellate courts in the future this bespeaks caution particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as alabama and mississippi torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business particularly alabama and mississippi creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

discontinued operations as described in note 3—discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our subsidiary united investors life insurance company united investors as of december 31 2010 because of the sale united investors’ financial results are excluded from this discussion since those operations are discontinued 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and to a limited extent annuities to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the major insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully described in note 14 — business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and benefit administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is 

  

net investment income 

less 

interest credited to net policy liabilities 

financing costs 

  

the tables in note 14 — business segments reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ending december 31 2010 additionally this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates yeartoyear comparability and which reconciles to net income that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations net income rose 28 or 112 million in 2010 to 517 million in 2009 net income declined 47 million or 10 to 405 million from 452 million on a diluted per share basis 2010 net income increased 29 to 630 in 2009 per share net income declined 5 to 488 included in 2010 results is the 35 million after tax loss on the disposal of united investors representing 43 per diluted share 

  

the major contributor to the growth in 2010 earnings compared with the previous two years was in realized investment gains and losses as 2010 had net gains of 24 million compared with net losses of 85 million in 2009 and 70 million in 2008 the losses in 2009 and 2008 included a number of writedowns of fixedmaturity securities that were determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired in 2009 aftertax realized investment losses reduced per share earnings 103 of which 113 per share related to otherthantemporary impairments of fixed maturities in 2008 aftertax losses accounted for 79 per share of which 78 related to fixed maturity otherthantemporary impairments in 2010 we had realized investment gains which added 30 to per diluted share earnings even though there was an otherthantemporary impairment writedown of 04 per share that offset the net gains for the period another important factor in 2010 earnings growth was a 21 million or 8 growth in our excess investment income the measure of profitability of our investment segment in 2009 excess investment income declined 28 million or 9 poor economic conditions in 2009 especially early in the year caused us to hold a significant portion in lowyielding cash and shortterm investments for increased liquidity excess investment income was also negatively affected in 2009 because of our issuance of a 300 million 9 1  4  debt security in june 2009 net proceeds of 296 million and repayment of a 99 million 8 1  4  security which matured in august 2009 these transactions resulted in a net increase in our financing costs in 2009 and reduced excess investment income results in our core life insurance segment rose 7 in 2010 to 455 million and also increased 3 in 2009 largely as a result of premium growth in both years the life segment is our largest contributor to operating results earnings from our health operations stabilized in 2010 after two years of declines this segment has experienced intense competition in recent periods resulting in significant declines in agent counts which in turn has resulted in 

  

index to financial statements lower sales of new health products health underwriting margins were flat at 170 million in 2010 after having declined 24 million or 12 in 2009 

  

total revenues increased 8 in 2010 to 337 billion in 2009 total revenues declined 3 to 312 billion from 320 billion in 2008 life premium rose 5 or 72 million in 2010 and 48 million in 2009 net investment income rose 44 million in 2010 compared with 5 million in 2009 however growth in revenues in 2009 and 2008 were negatively affected by the aforementioned pretax realized investment losses and declines in health premium described further under this caption 

  

while life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december 31 2010 margins as a percentage of premium have also held steady each year at 27 of premium life net sales rose 1 in 2010 to 330 million and 10 in 2009 to 326 million life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption life insurance 

  

we market three primary health insurance products medicare supplement insurance the medicare part d prescription drug benefit and underage65 limitedbenefit health insurance health premium declined 3 in 2010 to 987 million from 102 billion in 2009 health premium declined 10 in 2009 the decreases in both years were caused by the decline in agent count and poor persistency agent turnover has increased as lower premium lower margin products offered by competitors have provided agents with products that are easier to sell turnover has also increased due to the company’s decision to deemphasize the marketing of certain limitedbenefit products sales of these deemphasized products were discontinued altogether after september 2010 declines in these agent counts have resulted in lower net sales which in turn have pressured premium growth medicare supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium but increased competition has also dampened sales of this product in recent years resulting in premium declines in each successive year our medicare part d premium rose 14 in 2010 after having increased 5 in 2009 however as most of the country’s part d enrollees selected a plan provider in 2006 we do not expect significant growth in our part d business going forward see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

  

we offer fixed annuities but we do not emphasize sales of annuity products favoring life insurance instead with the sale of united investors we disposed of 37 of our annuity deposit balance see the caption annuities for further discussion of the annuity segment 

  

as previously mentioned the investment segment’s pretax profitability or excess investment income increased 21 million in 2010 but declined 28 million in 2009 profitability in this segment is based on three major components net investment income required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to insurance products and financing costs in recent years growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio however in 2010 the growth in net investment income exceeded the growth in the average portfolio amortized cost for the first time in many years primarily as a result of the special constraints on the growth in net investment income in 2009 noted below one reason that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of also there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested in which the funds are held in cash growth in total investment income has also been somewhat negatively affected by torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments during 2009 due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets we held significantly more cash and short term investments than we normally would additionally in 2009 we sold a significant portion of higheryielding but lowerrated fixed maturities and reinvested the proceeds in loweryielding but higherrated bonds in 2009 and early 2010 to improve our riskadjusted return these factors contributed to reduced 2009 net investment income 

  

the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income and generally grows in conjunction with the insurance policy reserves that are supported by the invested assets financing costs which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and shortterm debt are also deducted from net investment income in 2010 interest expense on our longterm debt rose 9 million after increasing 11 million in 2009 as noted earlier during 2009 we issued our 300 million 9 1  4  senior notes but repaid our 99 million 8 1  4  senior debentures resulting in a higher balance of debt outstanding at a 

  

index to financial statements higher interest rate however this segment has benefited from lower shortterm financing costs in each successive year as these costs have declined primarily due to lower rates on our shortterm debt 

  

torchmark’s current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investmentgrade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives approximately 94 of our invested assets at fair value consists of fixed maturities of which 93 was investment grade at december 31 2010 the average quality rating of the portfolio was bbb the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alta mortgages no direct investment in residential mortgages no counterparty risks no credit default swaps or derivative contracts see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and n ote 4—investments in the notes to consolidated statements of operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment 

  

as described earlier in this summary we wrote down certain fixed maturity and equity securities in each of the years 2008 through 2010 as these securities met our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment the pretax impairment losses were 5 million 143 million and 106 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively please refer to note 4—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption otherthantemporary impairments and under the caption realized gains and losses in this report for more information on these writedowns and our criteria for consideration of otherthantemporary impairment including the writedowns we had total aftertax realized investment gains of 24 million in 2010 30 per share realized investment losses of 85 million in 2009 103 per share and 70 million in 2008 79 per share realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and may have a material positive or negative impact on net income under the caption realized gains and losses in this report we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses including the writedowns also as explained in note 14—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments 

  

as mentioned earlier we used a portion of the 296 million proceeds from the offering of our 9 1  4  senior notes 300 million par amount in 2009 to repay our 99 million 8 1  4  senior debentures which also matured in 2009 in addition we also used 175 million to strengthen the capital position of certain of our insurance subsidiaries in 2009 in the form of capital contributions and surplus notes the regulatory capital positions of these subsidiaries had been negatively affected by ratingagency downgrades of bonds in their investment portfolios the subsidiaries in turn invested these funds in investmentgrade fixed maturities more information on these transactions can be found in note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 

  

in each of the years 2008 and 2009 income from continuing operations was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring nonoperating items we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations a discussion of these items follows 

  

as reported in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption litigation and tax settlements  we have been involved in certain litigation issues in 2008 and 2009 in which we either received settlements net of expenses or incurred settlement losses and expenses these issues resulted in a net aftertax charge of 770 thousand in 2008 additionally as described under the same caption of note 1 we received tax settlements in each year in the amounts of 29 million in 2009 and 108 million in 2008 all of these litigation and tax issues pertained to issues arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations legal and litigation expenses pertaining to current operations are included in either insurance administrative expenses or parent expenses as appropriate in our segment analysis income from litigation settlements is included in other income as explained in note 4—investments under the caption otherthantemporary impairments  we wrote down certain companyoccupied property to fair value during both 2009 and 2008 the write downs resulted in aftertax charges of 231 thousand in 2009 and 14 million in 2008 

  

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these 

  

index to financial statements purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises due to economic conditions in late 2008 and early 2009 we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2009 however in the first quarter of 2010 the board of directors reactivated the company’s previously suspended share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management in consultation with the board determines to be in the best interest of the company the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december 31 2010

throughout the remainder of this discussion share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings 

  

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows 

  

life insurance life insurance is our largest insurance segment with 2010 life premium representing 63 of total premium life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 73 of the total in 2010 additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

we have been in the process of combining selected united american ua exclusive agency branch offices with the liberty national exclusive agency for this reason all data will be reported on a combined basis in this report 

  

life insurance premium rose 5 to 166 billion in 2010 after having increased 3 in 2009 to 159 billion life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows

premium by distribution method 

dollar amounts in thousands 

  

   

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue net sales is 

  

index to financial statements annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

  

annualized life premium in force was 175 billion at december 31 2010 an increase of 3 over 169 billion a year earlier annualized life premium in force was 163 billion at december 31 2008

direct response consists of two primary components direct mail and insert media direct mail targets primarily young middleincome households with children the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time at this time we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response’s premier markets 

  

the insert media area targets primarily the adult market it involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media such as coupon packets newspapers bank statements and billings 

  

index to financial statements the direct response operation accounted for 34 of our life insurance premium during 2010 the largest of any distribution group life premium for this channel rose 6 in 2010 and 5 in 2009 net sales rose 4 in 2010 to 137 million after a 7 gain in 2009 to 132 million firstyear collected premium increased 6 in 2010 to 90 million after a 6 gain in 2009 

  

the american income exclusive agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions but also on credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales it is torchmark’s highest profit margin business life premium for this agency rose 10 to 560 million in 2010 after having increased 7 in 2009 net sales increased 8 in 2010 to 138 million from 128 million in 2009 as this agency was torchmark’s largest contributor to life net sales in 2010 net sales rose 18 in 2009 firstyear collected premium rose 16 in 2010 to 111 million after having increased 17 in 2009 as in the case of all of torchmark’s agency distribution systems continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count the american income agent count was 3912 at december 31 2010 compared with 4154 a year earlier a decline of 6 however the agent count rose 35 in 2009 from 3085 at year end 2008 after having risen 21 in 2008 this agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business additionally the systematic centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents 

  

as previously mentioned we have combined selected ua exclusive agency branch offices into the liberty national exclusive agency  this agency markets primarily lowface amount life insurance and supplemental health insurance to middleincome customers life premium income for this agency was 295 million in 2010 a 1 decrease compared with 298 million in 2009 life premium for this agency declined 2 in 2009 from 2008 firstyear collected premium on a combined basis declined 1 to 35 million in 2010 after having increased 6 in 2009 

  

the liberty agency’s net sales declined 19 to 45 million in 2010 after having increased 1 a year earlier this agency had 2001 producing agents at december 31 2010 compared with 2471 a year earlier a decline of 19 the agent count at liberty had also declined 51 in 2009 from 5020 the decrease in agent count has been due in part to the closing of several offices which have had low production in addition agent compensation issues that arose in 2009 have negatively impacted agent counts a twotier bonus threshold proved more difficult for producing agents to meet than anticipated management reverted to a level bonus threshold later in 2009 also due to deteriorating firstyear persistency on business written during 2008 and early 2009 management modified compensation incentives in 2009 to place more emphasis on the persistency of newly issued policies this resulted in the departure of a number of the less productive agents but improved first year persistency 

  

the liberty exclusive agency agent counts have also decreased due to issues related to its health insurance business until recently the agency’s health insurance marketing efforts had been focused on limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical plans these plans were subject to intense competition which ultimately resulted in decreases in agent counts in addition these limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments sales of these limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical plans were discontinued after september 2010 in response the agency has shifted its marketing focus to a product mix more weighted towards life insurance and supplemental health insurance products not affected by healthcare reform that have higher margins and persistency we believe this will increase the agency’s profitability and stability in the long run 

  

we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the military agency the united american independent agency and other small miscellaneous sales agencies the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of wholelife products with term insurance riders military premium represented 12 of life premium the united american independent agency represented less than 2 of torchmark’s total life premium this agency is focused on health insurance with life sales being incidental

gross margins as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense rose 7 in 2010 to 455 million after rising 3 in 2009 as a percentage of life insurance premium gross margins have been stable each year at 27 margin growth in all periods was primarily the result of premium growth 

  

health insurance health insurance sold by torchmark includes primarily medicare supplement and part d prescription drug coverage to enrollees in the federal medicare program cancer coverage and accident coverage all health coverage plans other than medicare supplement and part d are classified here as limitedbenefit plans for several years our primary health insurance product had been hospitalsurgical plans however as previously mentioned these plans became subject to intense competition which resulted in decreasing agent counts in addition these plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments these factors contributed to the company’s decisions to deemphasize and discontinue the marketing of these products in 2010 medicare supplement sales exceeded those of the limitedbenefit products for the first time since 2001 and represented 56 of health net sales exclusive of medicare part d medicare supplement sales have been stronger than limitedbenefit sales due in part to changes in agent counts in our health distribution groups discussed below 

  

index to financial statements total health premium represented 37 of torchmark’s total premium income in 2010 excluding part d premium health premium represented 32 in 2010 compared with 34 in 2009 and 38 in 2008 health underwriting margin excluding part d accounted for 24 of the total in 2010 compared with 26 in 2009 and 29 in 2008 these declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment as mentioned previously health results have also been negatively affected by increased competition in recent periods the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years

health insurance excluding medicare part d as noted under the caption life insurance  we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health due to life’s superior margins and other benefits our health distribution groups have also encountered increased competition in recent periods the increased competition has led to losses in agents in our liberty exclusive agency and independent agencies agent turnover has increased as lower premium lower margin products offered by competitors have provided agents with products that are easier to sell turnover has also increased due to the company’s decision to deemphasize the marketing of certain limitedbenefit products as previously discussed the marketing of these products was discontinued altogether after september 2010 declines in these agent counts have resulted in lower net sales which in turn have pressured premium growth health premium excluding part d premium fell 7 to 779 million in 2010 after declining 12 in 2009 medicare supplement premium declined 1 to 452 million in 2010 compared with a 6 decline in 2009 other limitedbenefit health premium dropped 14 in 2010 to 327 million after a decline of 18 in 2009 and 9 in 2008 net sales excluding medicare part d declined 33 to 64 million in 2010 net sales fell 30 in 2009 to 97 million medicare supplement net sales fell 21 in 2010 but rose 64 in 2009 other health net sales continued to decline falling 45 in 2010 and 54 in 2009 first year collected premium also declined in both 2010 and 2009 

  

  

index to financial statements medicare supplement provides the greatest amount of health premium partially because medicare supplement products are generally more persistent than the limitedbenefit products but also because of more stable sales in recent periods medicare supplement premium represented 58 of nonpart d health premium in 2010 compared with 55 in 2009 and 51 in 2008 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency is torchmark’s largest in terms of health premium income in 2010 this agency represented 43 of all torchmark nonpart d income health premium at 331 million the liberty agency markets medicare supplements and limitedbenefit health products including cancer insurance in 2010 health premium income in this agency declined 15 from prior year premium of 389 million premium also fell 18 in 2009 from 476 million firstyear collected premium declined 52 to 16 million in 2010 after declining 62 a year earlier as noted earlier increased competition in the health insurance market and our deemphasis of certain health products has caused declines in agent counts marketing of the deemphasized products was discontinued altogether after september 2010 the decline in agent counts has resulted in decreased new sales translating into declines in premium net sales for 2010 declined 52 from 30 million in 2009 to 14 million in 2009 this agency’s net sales fell 64 also discussed under the life insurance caption are efforts designed to strengthen this agency 

  

the ua independent agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large multistate organizations down to oneperson offices all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies torchmark had 1406 active producing agents at december 31 2010 this agency is our largest distributor of nonpart d health insurance in terms of health net sales representing 50 in 2010 this agency is also our largest carrier of medicare supplement insurance with 267 million or 59 of our medicare supplement premium income in 2010 net sales for this agency dropped 25 to 32 million in 2010 after having gained 14 to 43 million in 2009 medicare supplement net sales of 27 million declined 10 from 30 million a year earlier medicare supplement net sales had more than doubled in 2009 over net sales of 15 million in 2008 the increases in 2009 were due to increases in group medicare supplement sales group medicare supplement sales fluctuate greatly from period to period and do not indicate a trend total health premium income for the ua independent agency was 315 million in 2010 a 4 decline from 2009 premium of 326 million premium income also declined 9 in 2009 from 2008 these declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses 

  

the american income exclusive agency predominantly a life insurance distribution channel is our third largest health insurance distributor based on 2010 premium collected its health plans are comprised of various limitedbenefit plans approximately 70 of the agency’s 2010 health premium was from accident policies sales of the plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 

  

health premium at this agency rose 5 in 2010 to 79 million after having increased 2 to 75 million in 2009 net health sales were 13 million in both 2010 and 2009 compared with 12 million in 2008 net health sales comprised 9 of the american income agency’s total net sales in 2010 

  

direct response  primarily a life operation also offers health insurance which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups in 2010 net health sales were 5 million comprising approximately 4 of direct response’s total life and health net sales direct response health premium income has risen each year over the prior year health premium rose 17 in 2010 to 54 million and 3 in 2009 

  

medicare part d torchmark through its subsidiary united american offers coverage under the government’s medicare part d plan the medicare part d plan is a standalone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american unlike the traditional medicare program for hospital and doctor services where cms is the primary insurer and private medicare supplement insurers are secondary insurers the program generally calls for cms to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium total medicare part d premium was 209 million in 2010 compared with 184 million in 2009 an increase of 14 part d premium rose 5 in 2009 changes in part d premium generally result from changes in the 

  

index to financial statements number of enrollees enrollment for all part d coverages ends on december 31 of the previous year except for enrollees who reach age 65 in the current year at december 31 2010 united american had approximately 144 thousand enrollees for the 2011 part d plan compared with 158 thousand for the 2010 plan year and 147 thousand for the 2009 plan year our medicare part d product is sold primarily through the direct response operation but is also sold to groups through the ua independent agency part d net sales were 39 million in 2010 compared with 43 million in 2009 and 28 million in 2008 we count only sales to new firsttime enrollees in net sales and the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees 

  

we believe that the medicare part d program is a meaningful component of our health product offerings because of our experience with the seniorage market and with medicare supplements the government assurances with regard to the risksharing agreements for participating insurers the incremental income added to our health insurance margins and the renewal of the business every year due to our experience with service to the seniorage market and the use of our existing direct response marketing system entry to this business required little new investment however we do not expect significant growth in the part d product in the near future as most medicare beneficiaries have already chosen a plan additionally as with any governmentsponsored program the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market

annuities as described in note 3—discontinued operations  we sold our subsidiary united investors united investors was our carrier of variable annuities and a primary carrier of fixed annuities as a result of the sale we disposed of approximately 37 of our annuity deposit balance as of december 31 2010 including all variable annuities these balances have been reported as “held for sale” on the consolidated balance sheets of prior periods accordingly we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward 

  

our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2010 2009 and 2008 were 124 billion 959 million and 817 million respectively

while the fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year policy charges and underwriting income have fluctuated only modestly the stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist of surrender charges and are not based on account size these charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements which can result in negative net policy obligations in both 2010 and 2009 the spreads for fixed annuities increased over the prior year as a result of credited rate reductions on the inforce annuities furthermore spreads were increased by the introduction of a new annuity form on liberty national paper in mid2009 the amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits 

  

index to financial statements administrative expenses operating expenses are included in the other and corporate segments and are classified into two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company the following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2010 

  

operating expenses selected information 

dollar amounts in thousands 

  

   

insurance administrative expenses rose 4 in 2010 after having declined 4 in 2009 as a percentage of premium they increased to 59 in 2010 from 58 in both 2009 and 2008 the 2010 increase was caused primarily by higher employee costs mostly related to higher employee health benefit costs partially offsetting the increase in employee costs was a decline in legal costs as we favorably settled certain previously reserved litigation during 2010 in 2009 increases in salaries were more than offset by declines in other administrative costs and other employee costs as a result of the effort to achieve greater consistency in expense classification among our subsidiaries we deferred 12 million more of deferrable administrative expense to acquisition expense in 2009 compared with 2008 these reductions in administrative expense were partially offset by increases in pension and other employee benefit costs during the period 

  

index to financial statements as mentioned in note 1— significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we settled litigation for 25 million in 2008 relating to issues occurring many years ago as previously noted we do not consider the costs of settling litigation applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations stock compensation expense declined in 2009 primarily as a result of the lower stock price caused by the severe market decline in 2009 and the effect it had on values at the time of our annual stock and stock option grants for 2009 expense related to the new 2009 grants replaced the expense for costlier older grants that became fully vested stock compensation expense rose in 2010 as market conditions improved resulting in higher values for stock and option grants in 2010 management believes that stock compensation expense will increase slightly in 2011 as stated in note 14—business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense and therefore treats it as a parent company expense as described in note 4—investments under the caption otherthantemporary impairments  we wrote down certain companyoccupied real estate because it met our criteria as described in that note for otherthantemporary impairment as a result we incurred a pretax charge of 21 million in 2008 and 355 thousand in 2009 which are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the respective year 

  

investments we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 14— business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used over 42 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

index to financial statements excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  

  

    

excess investment income increased 21 million or 8 in 2010 over the prior year excess investment income declined 28 million or 9 in 2009 on a per diluted share basis excess investment income rose 9 to 362 per share in 2010 after having declined 3 in the prior year share purchases caused the 2010 increase in per share excess investment income to be greater than the dollar amount of increase likewise those purchases also caused the decline in per share excess investment income in 2009 to be less than the decline in the dollar amount 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income which rose 8 to 685 million in 2010 it increased 1 to 632 million in 2009 from 627 million in 2008 presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets 

  

   

in 2010 the growth in net investment income exceeded the growth in mean invested assets at amortized cost for the first time in many years one of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of another factor that has contributed to the relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested during these lags we have held cash at lower yields one of the most important factors contributing to the low growth rate in investment income during 2009 is the fact that due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets we held significantly more cash and short term investments during 2009 than we did during 2010 and 2008 had we not done so and if short term investment rates had not been much lower during 2009 than in 2008 the growth rate in investment income during 2009 would have been approximately the same as the growth rate in mean assets 

  

index to financial statements excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 

  

interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

the average interest crediting rate has risen in each of the last three years in 2001 as part of our normal review of policy reserve assumptions we increased the interest rate assumption 100 basis points 1 on policies issued after january 1 2001 as this group of policies becomes a larger proportion of our business the average crediting rate will continue to increase for more specific information on life and health crediting rates please refer to note 6—future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs

index to financial statements the table below presents the components of financing costs 

  

analysis of financing costs 

amounts in thousands 

  

   

financing costs increased 6 million or 8 in 2010 they rose 7 million or 11 in 2009 the increases in financing costs in both years reflect the issuance in june 2009 of 300 million principal amount 9 ¼ senior notes due in 2019 in 2010 we incurred a full year of interest on this issue the increase in 2009 was partially offset by the maturity in august 2009 of 99 million principal amount 8 ¼ senior debentures shortterm interest expense has trended downward over the past three years decreasing 3 million in 2010 after having declined 4 million in 2009 these declines have resulted from significantly lower interest rates when compared with the respective prior year the 2010 decrease was also impacted by a 22 decline in the average balance of commercial paper outstanding compared with 2009 

  

excess investment income benefits from increases in longterm rates available on new investments and decreases in shortterm borrowing rates of these two factors higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at shortterm rates 

  

investment acquisitions  torchmark’s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investmentgrade fixed maturities generally with long maturities maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date that meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities we believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable if such longerterm securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives we consider investing in shortterm securities taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time during calendar years 2008 through 2010 torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities 

  

index to financial statements the following table summarizes selected information for fixedmaturity purchases the effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield this date is commonly known as the “worst call date” two different average life calculations are shown average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date

we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether or not and if so when the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment however the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart the average life of funds invested in 2009 to both next call and maturity was lower than that of funds invested during 2008 and 2010 due to actions taken for statutory capital management purposes and the limited availability of longer term investments 

  

during the three years 2008 through 2010 we have invested primarily in investmentgrade corporate bonds during 2008 we invested a considerable amount of the funds in trust preferred securities and redeemable preferred stocks with longer scheduled maturity dates often exceeding 30 years in virtually all cases such securities are callable many years prior to the scheduled maturity date during 2009 and 2010 we acquired a significant amount of taxable municipal bonds primarily build america bonds authorized by the american recovery and retirement act of 2009 in assessing the creditworthiness of these bonds we took into account the geographic location of the municipalities the investments in these municipal bonds consisted almost exclusively of general obligation bonds and revenue bonds for essential services 

  

new cash flow available to us for investment has been affected by issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past three years although this effect has diminished each successive year issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost calls increase funds available for investment but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called issuer calls were 109 million in 2010 181 million in 2009 and 238 million in 2008 the higher level of acquisitions in 2009 was primarily due to the additional cash flow available from the special sales transactions noted below 

  

index to financial statements sales transactions as disclosed in note 4—investments  the company sold 703 million of fixed maturities at amortized cost in the third quarter of 2009 including 293 million of below investmentgrade securities the market value for some of these securities increased significantly during the period to a level where even though the sales price was less than amortized cost management determined that better riskadjusted returns could be achieved by selling rather than continuing to hold the securities other securities were sold at prices that produced gains to offset these losses for tax purposes due in large part to selling belowinvestmentgrade securities and reinvesting the proceeds in investmentgrade securities belowinvestmentgrade securities as a percentage of total fixed maturities at amortized cost declined from 15 at june 30 2009 to 9 at december 31 2009 the reduction in belowinvestmentgrade securities had a positive impact on the riskbased capital position of our insurance subsidiaries 

  

portfolio analysis because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms the following table presents a comparison of torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2010 with the latest industry data 

  

   

at december 31 2010 approximately 94 of our investments at book value were in a diversified fixedmaturity portfolio policy loans which are secured by policy cash values made up an additional 3 the remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities mortgage loans and other longterm and shortterm investments

index to financial statements credit risk sensitivity credit risk is the level of certainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity approximately 87 of our fixedmaturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities including redeemable preferred and assetbacked securities as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities credit risk is a concern we mitigate this ongoing risk in part by acquiring investmentgrade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis we also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors 

  

the following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at december 31 2010 

  

   

at december 31 2010 approximately 35 of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost 34 at fair value were in the financial sector including 16 in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 14 in banks at amortized cost financial guarantors mortgage insurers and insurance brokers comprised approximately 5 of the portfolio after financials the next largest sector was utilities which comprised 15 of the portfolio at amortized cost the balance of the portfolio is spread among 268 issuers in a wide variety of sectors as previously noted gross unrealized losses were 368 million at december 31 2010 declining from 699 million a year earlier as shown in the chart above the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position at december 31 2010 compared with a net unrealized loss position at the prior year end approximately 60 of the change in the fair value relative to amortized cost in 2010 was attributable to improvements in the financial sectors while the remaining 40 was in the nonfinancial sectors as discussed in note 4 —investments  we believe much of the unrealized losses experienced in 2008 and 2009 were attributable to illiquidity in the financial markets we expect to recover the full book value of our investments in impaired securities 

  

as shown in the table above the ratio of gross unrealized losses to book value was greater than 45 for our investments in cdos and the financial guarantor sector we evaluated each of the impaired securities in these and all other sectors to determine whether or not any of the impairments were otherthantemporary certain information about our evaluation of the impaired securities in the cdo and monoline insurer sectors is provided in the following paragraphs 

  

index to financial statements at december 31 2010 we held investments in five different cdos in our opinion our investments in four of these cdos were otherthantemporarily impaired three of these cdos have been written down to a carrying value of zero the fourth is carried at a value of 34 million less than the present value of discounted future cash flows at original purchase yield but greater than its fair value of 17 million the fifth cdo 22 million amortized cost and 6 million fair value we believe was not otherthantemporarily impaired at december 31 2009 the four cdos that were otherthantemporarily impaired had an amortized cost of 34 million 13 million fair value the cdo that was not otherthantemporarily impaired had an amortized cost of 21 million 5 million fair value in reaching these conclusions concerning otherthantemporary impairment we reviewed and discussed with the collateral managers of each of these cdos the current status of the collateral underlying our investments the credit events defaults and deferrals in underlying collateral experienced to date and the possibility of future credit events we calculated expected future cash flows using assumptions for expected future credit events that reflect actual historical experience and expected future experience we reviewed the actual versus expected cash flows received to date and the impact that potential future credit events would have on our expected future cash flows we calculated the magnitude of future credit events that could be experienced without negatively impacting the recovery of our investment and our expected yield rate while there is a possibility that future credit events will exceed our current expectations we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions 

  

also at december 31 2009 we held investments issued by five different monoline insurers in our opinion our investments in three of these monoline insurers 9 million amortized cost and 10 million fair value were otherthantemporarily impaired these securities were sold in 2010 for 12 million for a realized gain of 3 million our investments in the other two monoline insurers 83 million amortized cost and 37 million fair value at december 31 2009 were not believed to be otherthantemporarily impaired at december 31 2010 these two investments were carried at an amortized cost of 84 million fair value 56 million we collected and analyzed a significant amount of information to form opinions about the reasons for the severity of our impairments including the illiquidity of some of our holdings and its impact on fair values the expected future experience in the mortgage market and the reasonable expectation of the receipt of all future contractual interest and principal payments for these investments we reviewed news and information about the economy and the mortgage market in general and about the issuers of our investments we reviewed and analyzed financial statements and had discussions with sellside and independent credit analysts who follow this sector certain regulators and members of the management teams of some of the issuers of our investments while there is a possibility that future experience in the mortgage markets will differ from our current expectations we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions

fixed maturities by rating 

at december 31 2010 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

the portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of bbb based on amortized cost approximately 92 of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by subprime or alta mortgages loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower we have no direct investments in residential mortgages nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts we do not participate in securities lending there are no offbalance sheet investments as all investments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets  at december 31 2010 we had 22 million at fair value  57 million book value invested in cdos for which the composite rating at that date was c the collateral underlying these cdos is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies and no subprime or alta mortgages are included in the collateral 

  

our current investment policy is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

  

index to financial statements market risk sensitivity torchmark’s financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since 94 of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixedmaturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixedrate investments the portfolio is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value under normal market conditions we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however in accordance with gaap these liabilities are not marked to market 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2010 and 2009 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points 

  

   

realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits we also incur acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

because our investment portfolio is large and diverse investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses occur only incidentally usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the periodtoperiod trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

as described in note 4— investments under the caption otherthan temporary impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we wrote certain securities down to fair value during each year 2008 through 2010 as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in note 4 and in our critical accounting policies in this report the writedowns resulted in pretax charges of 5 million in 2010 3 million after tax 143 million in 2009 94 million after tax and 106 million in 2008 69 million after tax the 2009 charge included 83 million on cdos 55 million after tax and 24 million on monoline financial guarantors and mortgage insurers 16 million after tax the remaining writedowns in 2009 were from losses on a variety of corporate bonds in 2008 the significant bonds written down were lehman brothers bonds of 74 million pretax 48 million after tax and washington mutual bonds of 19 million pretax 12 million after tax other writedowns in 2008 included perpetual preferred stocks of federal national mortgage association and certain nonfinancial securities 

  

additionally as described in note 4  we wrote down a real estate investment to fair value in 2008 resulting in a loss of 11 million 718 thousand after tax we wrote down an additional 205 thousand 133 thousand after tax in 2009 on this investment in 2010 we acquired 73 million book value of our 9 1  4  senior notes at a cost of 89 million resulting in an aftertax loss on debt redemption of 11 million 

  

index to financial statements financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes 

  

insurance subsidiary liquidity the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes the funds to provide for policy benefits the majority of which are paid in future periods are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities to meet these longterm obligations in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restriction the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year earnings calculated on a statutory basis 

  

parent company liquidity cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay parent company dividends on common and preferred stock interest and principal repayments on parent company debt and operating expenses of the parent in 2010 the parent received 401 million of dividends and transfers from its insurance subsidiaries as compared with 392 million in 2009 and 437 million in 2008 after paying debt obligations shareholder dividends and other expenses but before share repurchases torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in 2010 of approximately 269 million parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases in 2011 it is expected that the parent company will receive 742 million in dividends from subsidiaries including approximately 305 million of the proceeds from the sale of united investors and that approximately 655 million will be available as excess cash flow certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 12 — shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company as additional liquidity the parent held 63 million of cash and shortterm investments at december 31 2010 compared with 155 million a year earlier the parent also had available a 138 million receivable from subsidiaries at december 31 2010 

  

shortterm borrowings an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 600 million as described in the commercial paper section of note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  this facility was entered into on december 10 2010 and replaced an earlier 600 million facility which would have expired in august 2011 as of december 31 2010 we had available 203 million under this facility for detailed information about this new line of credit facility see the commercial paper section of note 11 —debt 

  

index to financial statements the following table presents certain information about our shortterm borrowings all of which was commercial paper during the two years ending december 31 2010 and december 31 2009

dollar amounts in millions 

  

  

   

there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market under this facility during the years ending december 31 2010 and 2009 

  

in summary torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2011 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of additional debt a shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing 

  

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were 103 billion in 2010 compared with 976 million in 2009 and 731 million in 2008 in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies have received 321 million in investment calls and tenders and 318 million of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2010 maturities tenders and calls totaled 761 million in 2009 and 581 million in 2008 

  

our cash and shortterm investments were 582 million at yearend 2010 and 529 million at yearend 2009 included in cash at december 31 2010 was the 343 million of proceeds received from the sale of united investors on that date additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 105 billion at december 31 2010 however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as fully described and discussed in note 11 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt torchmark had outstanding 120 million par amount 71 trust preferred securities at both december 31 2010 and 2009 the capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders the trust is an offbalance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules deconsolidation is required because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest therefore torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity even though we own all of the entity’s voting equity and have guaranteed the entity’s performance while these liabilities are not on our consolidated balance sheets  they are represented by torchmark’s 71 junior subordinated debentures due to the trust these junior subordinated debentures were a torchmark liability of 124 million par and book value at both december 31 2010 and 2009 these securities are indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption capital resources in this report the 71 preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our 71 interest payment on our debt to the trusts as described in note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 

  

index to financial statements as a part of its abovementioned credit facility torchmark has outstanding 198 million in standby letters of credit however these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole 

  

as of december 31 2010 we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of thirdparty entities other than as described above all of our guarantees other than the trust preferred guarantee were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 15 — commitments and contingencies

index to financial statements capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in note 11 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements longterm funded debt junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities and shareholders’ equity the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark’s capital trust iii which is liable for its trust preferred securities in accordance with gaap these instruments are included in “due to affiliates” on the consolidated balance sheets a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 11—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

the carrying value of the funded debt was  913 million at december 31 2010 compared with 920 million a year earlier as fully explained in note 11—debt  we issued 300 million principal amount of 9¼ senior notes due in 2019 in june of 2009 for proceeds of 296 million a portion of these proceeds were used to repay the 99 million due upon the august 2009 maturity of our 8¼ senior debentures of the 197 million balance of the proceeds 175 million was contributed as capital to our insurance subsidiaries in 2009 the subsidiaries then in turn invested these funds in investmentgrade corporate bonds and municipal bonds the capital contributions were made as a result of our desire to maintain subsidiary regulatory capital at levels adequate to meet the requirements of rating agencies 

  

poor economic conditions experienced during 2009 caused the ratings of many bonds in our insurance subsidiaries’ portfolios to be downgraded and also resulted in increased otherthantemporary impairments taken this large volume of ratings downgrades and impairments in 2009 had a significant negative effect on the subsidiaries’ regulatory capital our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 325 of required regulatory capital under riskbased capital rbc a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital the 325 target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows the relatively low risk of their product mix and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark rbc was favorably impacted in 2009 by these capital contributions and the sales of belowinvestmentgrade securities discussed under the caption investments—sales transactions in this report improvements in financial markets in 2010 which resulted in rating upgrades in the bond portfolios further strengthened the capital position of our insurance subsidiaries in 2010 at both december 31 2010 and 2009 our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had rbc ratios in excess of 350 should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future and the ratio falls below 325 management has available cash on hand and a credit line at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 325 

  

as noted under the caption highlights in this report we reactivated our share repurchase program during the first quarter of 2010 we previously had suspended the program indefinitely in march 2009 due to general economic conditions at that time under this program we acquired 4 million shares at a cost of 204 million in 2010 average of 5351 million per share 2 million shares for 47 million in 2009 and 8 million shares for 427 million in 2008 the majority of purchased shares are retired each year please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption highlights in this report 

  

torchmark has recently increased the dividend on its common shares in the first quarter of 2010 the dividend was increased from 14 per share to 15 per share and in the fourth quarter of 2010 it was further increased to 16 per share 

  

shareholders’ equity was 40 billion at december 31 2010 compared with 34 billion at december 31 2009 during the twelve months since december 31 2009 shareholders’ equity was reduced by the 204 million in share purchases but has been increased by after tax unrealized gains of 345 million in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved as explained in note 4—investments—unrealized loss analysis  unrealized losses in 2008 and early 2009 resulted primarily from illiquidity in the financial markets as a result of general economic conditions 

  

we plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future but we will be cautious in doing so excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in fixed maturities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies 

  

index to financial statements we maintain a significant availableforsale fixedmaturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets while invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets recently the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio had been depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity resulting in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity because of the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  

selected financial data 

  

  

     

effective in 2008 the fasb issued new guidance offering an option which if elected would permit us to value our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets  however unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our availableforsale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results therefore we have not elected this option 

  

index to financial statements the fixed maturity portfolio contained 18 billion in net unrealized investment losses at year end 2008 11 billion after tax and the associated adjustment to deferred acquisition costs including fixed maturities in the subsidiary sold in 2010 these unrealized losses are believed by management to have been brought on by widening credit spreads in financial markets and were the primary factor in the decline in our shareholders’ equity in 2008 in 2009 as conditions in financial markets began to improve unrealized losses declined 13 billion 9 billion after tax as financial markets continued to improve in 2010 the 456 million of unrealized losses at year end 2009 in the fixed maturity portfolio turned into 107 million of unrealized gains a positive change of 531 million after taking into account the adjustment of 32 million to deferred acquisition costs 345 million after tax torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 113 times in 2010 compared with 93 times in 2009 and 109 times in 2008 this timesinterestearned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pretax income from continuing operations and interest expense a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 

  

credit ratings  the chart below presents torchmark’s credit ratings as of december 31 2010 

  

   

during the three year period ended december 31 2010 each of the rating agencies revised the outlook for torchmark from stable to negative and then back to stable reasons cited for the negative outlook included increased risk in our investment portfolio tighter liquidity and reduced financial flexibility reasons cited for the revision back to a stable outlook included improved financial flexibility increased capital levels at the insurance subsidiaries the decrease in unrealized losses and strong operating performance 

  

the credit quality of torchmark’s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies during 2009 a m best downgraded our preferred stock from bbb to bbb also in 2009 fitch downgraded our senior debt from a to bbb two notches our preferred stock from a to bbb two notches and our commercial paper from f1 to f2 one notch fitch stated that the downgrades were a result of the weakness in the statutory capital position of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries brought on by the ratings downgrades of fixed maturity securities held in the subsidiaries’ investment portfolios they also expressed concern with the level of intercompany financing by the parent company from the subsidiaries the ongoing exposure to financial market turmoil and the expectation of continued investment deterioration going forward in january 2010 fitch further downgraded our preferred stock one notch to bbb at that time fitch downgraded over 200 hybrid securities issued by insurance industry entities as their assessments of these securities in our industry changed 

  

the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is also rated by standard  poor’s and a m best the following chart presents these ratings for our four largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2010

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries such punitive damage claims that are tried in alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined additionally it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

new unadopted accounting rules 

  

the fasb has issued new accounting guidance potentially applicable to torchmark effective in future periods 

  

policy acquisition costs  this new accounting guidance amends the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts in order to address the diversity in practice surrounding the capitalization and deferral of these costs this guidance will be effective for torchmark beginning january 1 2012 with early adoption permitted prospective or retrospective application is permitted we are currently evaluating the new guidance at this time we expect its adoption to reduce our shareholders’ equity approximately 8 at the time of adoption we intend to adopt this guidance retrospectively because both the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs will be lower in future periods and those effects are largely offsetting we do not expect that there will be a material impact on operating results going forward 

  

index to financial statements critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note 6 — future policy benefit reserves  

  

approximately 78 of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2010 were traditional insurance liabilities whereby the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies a premium deficiency event for torchmark’s traditional business is very rare and did not occur during the three years ended december 31 2010 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business whereby the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales additionally the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption “value of insurance purchased” as indicated in note 5 — deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to consolidated financial statements our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

approximately 97 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2010 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2010 

  

the remaining portion of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised as noted earlier in this report our variable annuity block was disposed of as of december 31 2010 revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31 2010 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of 

  

index to financial statements policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

  

valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to maintain our investment quality and diversification standards we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixedmaturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

during recent periods the values of our fixed maturities were also affected by illiquidity in the financial markets which contributed to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixedmaturity investments is presented in note 4—investments under the caption fair value measurements  

  

impairment of investments we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value where fair value has declined below carrying value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies and note 4 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2010 our net liability under these plans was 286 million 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected our discount rate rate of 

  

index to financial statements return on assets and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in note 10 — postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to us note 10 also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies and other related data

as of the end of the fiscal year completed december 31 2010 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of torchmark management including the chairman and chief executive officer and the executive vice president and chief financial officer of torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures as those terms are defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based upon their evaluation the chairman and chief executive officer and the executive vice president and chief financial officer have concluded that torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the date of this form 10k in compliance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 18 usc § 1350 each of these officers executed a certification included as an exhibit to this form 10k

index to financial statements management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management at torchmark corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis as a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting the company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls accordingly even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time 

  

management evaluated the company’s internal control over financial reporting and based on its assessment determined that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2010 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of torchmark corporation and subsidiaries “torchmark” as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion torchmark maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2010 of torchmark and our report dated february 28 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

annuities 

  

annuity products offered include singlepremium deferred annuities flexiblepremium deferred annuities and prior to 2008 variable annuities in recent years torchmark has deemphasized the marketing of annuity products annuities in each of the three years ending december 31 2009 comprised less than 1 of premium 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses all of which are generally based on company experience and on projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

  

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

  

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis a list of the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in the financial statements  see note 5 — future policy benefit reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

  

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities fixed maturities represented 92 of total investments at fair value at december 31 2009  see note 3 — investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis  

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system at december 31 2009 torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in indiana nebraska and new york 

  

insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions 

  

personnel 

  

at the end of 2009 torchmark had 2360 employees and 1145 licensed employees under sales contracts 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks related to our business 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a mature regulated industry populated by many firms we operate in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

the development and maintenance of our various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales and profits because our life and health insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market the development maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical we compete for producing agents with other insurers primarily on the basis of our products and compensation adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates producing agents to increase sales is critical as our competitors seek to hire away our agents from time to time increased competition has led to a reduction in agents in our united american branch office agency and united american independent agency which have historically been our major health distribution channels in direct response continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies may result in reduced sales and profits 

  

economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations we serve primarily the middleincome market for individual protection life and health insurance and as a result we compete directly with alternative uses of a customer’s disposable income if disposable income within this demographic group declines or the use of disposable income becomes more limited as a result of an economic downturn or otherwise then new sales of our insurance products could become more challenging and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether 

  

variations in expected to actual rates of mortality morbidity persistency and healthcare utilization could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish a liability for our policy reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims these reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability but rather are actuarial estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain the reserve computations involve the exercise of significant judgment with respect to levels of mortality morbidity persistency and healthcare utilization as well as the timing of premium and benefit payments even though our actuaries continually test expectedtoactual results actual levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set accordingly we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of claims or benefits that we will pay or the timing of such payments significant variations from the levels assumed when policy reserves are first set could negatively affect our profit margins and income 

  

a ratings downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations various rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers including our insurance subsidiaries and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer’s ability to meet policyholder and contract holder obligations these ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in our insurance products our ability to market these products and our competitive position a downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect us in many ways including the following limiting or restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us adversely affecting our ability to sell insurance products adversely affecting relationships with distributors and sales agents increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals of funds requiring a reduction in prices for our insurance products in order to remain competitive and a lowering of our credit ratings 

  

rating agencies also publish credit ratings for us credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner these ratings are important to our overall ability to access certain types of liquidity actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings or an 

  

announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could have a material adverse effect on our operations including limiting our access to capital markets increasing the cost of debt impairing our ability to raise capital to refinance maturing debt obligations limiting our capacity to support growth at our insurance subsidiaries and making it more difficult to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 

  

ratings reflect only the rating agency’s views and are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to the views of the rating agency general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company’s control in addition rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company and from time to time rating agencies have in their discretion altered the models changes to the models could impact the rating agencies’ judgment of the rating to be assigned to the rated company there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant we cannot predict what actions the rating agencies may take or what actions we may take in response to the actions of the rating agencies which could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

  

our life products are sold in selected niche markets we are at risk should any of these markets diminish we have two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches labor union members and sales via direct response distribution the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales in recent years labor union membership has experienced minimal growth and has declined as a percentage of employed workers most of our direct response business is solicited either through direct mail or by insertion into other mail media for distribution significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business 

  

health insurance marketplace risks 

  

congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact our medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of our inforce health insurance business because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future the nature and timing of these changes cannot be predicted and could have a material adverse effect on that business 

  

our medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers our medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senioraged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare such as health maintenance organizations hmos and other managed care or private plans the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance 

  

our medicare supplement and other health insurance business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales in recent years price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market as well as the market for other health products has been significant characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to underprice new sales in order to gain market share we have elected not to compete on those terms which has negatively affected sales should these industry practices continue it is likely that our sales of health insurance products will remain depressed 

  

our health insurance business is at risk in the event of governmentsponsored underage65 health insurance currently our leading health insurance sales are from limited benefit products sold to people under age 65 these products are in demand when buyers are either self employed or their employers offer limited or no health insurance to employees if in the future the government offers comprehensive health care to people under age 65 demand for this product would likely decline which would have a material adverse effect on our sales in this business 

  

an inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for the health insurance policies we sell due to regulatory delay could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition a significant percentage of the health insurance premiums that our insurance subsidiaries earn is from medicare supplement insurance medicare supplement insurance and the terms under which the premiums for such policies may be increased are highly regulated at both the state and federal level as a result it is characterized by lower profit margins than life insurance and requires strict administrative discipline and economies of scale for success because medicare supplement policies are coordinated with the federal medicare program which experiences health care inflation every year annual premium rate increases for the medicare supplement policies are necessary obtaining timely rate increases is of critical importance to our success in this market accordingly the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities in the future could adversely impact their profitability 

  

proposals for national health care reform could have a negative effect on the profitability or marketability of the health insurance products that we sell we sell supplemental limitedbenefit health insurance products to individuals as well as medicare supplement policies and medicare part d prescription drug insurance addressing the affordability and availability of health insurance including reducing the number of uninsured is a major initiative of the administration and members of the us congress and proposals that would address these issues are pending in the us congress and in many states the proposals vary and include the following a public health plan and other private health plans for individual and small business customers individual insurance mandates potential tax ramifications including among other things additional taxes on health insurers the expansion of eligibility under existing medicaid andor federal employees health benefit plan programs minimum medical benefit ratios for health plans mandatory issuance of insurance coverage limitations on antitrust immunity and requirements that would limit the ability of health plans and insurers to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk while certain of these measures could negatively affect us at this time we cannot predict whether or when any of these measures will be enacted and if enacted the extent of the impact of these proposals on our business or results of operations if any of these initiatives ultimately becomes effective it could have a material negative effect on the profitability or marketability of the health insurance products and services we sell and on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

variable annuity marketplace risk 

  

our variable annuity business is at risk should equity markets decline revenues and underwriting income for variable annuities are based on policyholder account values which consist of investments primarily in equity markets when equity markets decline not only would revenues be expected to decline but we would generally expect redemptions to increase further negatively affecting revenues and underwriting income as a part of this business we also guarantee a minimum death benefit to policyholders to be paid regardless of account size upon death therefore even though variable annuities are no longer a significant part of our business and we no longer offer variable annuity products because of this guaranteed death benefit our obligation costs rise as the account balance declines additionally the decline in policyholder account size will require us to adjust our actuarial assumptions on this business to take into account the lower revenues as a result these revisions in assumptions could cause us to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and will generally negatively impact our underwriting income 

  

investment risks 

  

our investments are subject to market and credit risks our invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of fixedmaturity and shortterm investments a significant portion of our fixedmaturity investments is comprised of corporate bonds exposing us to the risk that individual corporate issuers will not have the ability to make required interest or principal payments on the investment factors that may affect both market and credit risks include interest rate levels financial market performance disruptions in credit markets and general economic conditions as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of each issuer additionally because the majority of our investments are longerterm fixed maturities that we typically hold until maturity significant increases in interest rates widening of credit spreads or inactive markets associated with market downturns could 

  

cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of our fixed investment portfolio even with regard to performing assets these declines could cause a material increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio significant unrealized losses can substantially reduce our capital position and shareholders’ equity it is possible that our investment in certain of these securities with unrealized losses may experience a default event and that a portion or all of that unrealized loss may not be recoverable in that case the unrealized loss will be realized at which point we would take an impairment charge reducing our net income 

  

difficulties in the business of particular issuers or in industries in which we hold investments could cause significant downgrades delinquencies and defaults in our investment portfolio potentially resulting in lower net investment income and increased realized and unrealized investment losses difficult conditions in us capital markets in recent periods have caused a notable increase in the troubled status of businesses in which we hold investments if difficulties within these businesses and industries increase or continue without improvement there could be increased deferrals and defaults on amounts owed to us if difficult conditions in the capital markets and the economic recession continue or worsen we could experience additional credit downgrades or default events within our investment portfolio 

  

a default by an issuer could result in a significant otherthantemporary impairment of that investment causing us to write the investment down and take a charge against net income the risk of default is higher for bonds with longerterm maturities which we acquire in order to match our longterm insurance obligations we attempt to reduce this risk by purchasing only investment grade securities and by carefully evaluating an issuer before entering into an investment also while we have invested in a broad array of industries and issuers in order to attempt to maintain a highly diversified portfolio a significant amount of our investments is in banks insurance companies and other financial institutions which have experienced an increased level of downgrades recently moreover we cannot be assured that any particular issuer regardless of industry will be able to make required interest and principal payments on a timely basis or at all any further otherthantemporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus leading to lower riskbased capital ratios potential downgrades of our ratings by rating agencies and a potential reduction of future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries while we intend to hold our investments until maturity a severe increase in defaults could cause us to suffer a significant decrease in investment income or principal repayments resulting in substantial realized losses from the writedowns of impaired investments current net income would be negatively impacted by the writedowns and prospective net income would be adversely impacted by the loss of future interest income 

  

a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the rates credited to the net policy liabilities while we attempt to manage our investments to preserve the excess investment income spread we provide no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in our investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

  

liquidity risks 

  

our liquidity to fund operations is substantially dependent on funds available primarily dividends from our insurance subsidiaries as a holding company with no direct operations our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance subsidiaries which periodically declare and distribute dividends on their capital stock moreover our liquidity including our ability to pay our operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on debt securities or other indebtedness owed by us as well as our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or any preferred stock depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries and the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us other sources of liquidity for us also include a variety of short and longterm instruments including our credit facility commercial paper and medium and longterm debt 

  

the principal sources of our insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity are insurance premiums as well as investment income maturities repayments and other cash flow from our investment portfolio our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to us including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds for example under certain state insurance laws an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations excluding capital gains and losses or 10 of statutory surplus without regulatory approval accordingly a disruption in our insurance subsidiaries’ operations could reduce their capital or cash flow and as a result limit or disallow payment of dividends to us a principal source of our cash flow 

  

we can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to us by our subsidiaries although we do not anticipate changes changes in these laws could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses additionally the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to obtain approval of premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact their profitability and thus their ability to declare and distribute dividends to us limitations on the flow of dividends from our subsidiaries could limit our ability to service and repay debt or to pay dividends on our capital stock 

  

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or access capital as well as affect our cost of capital the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme instability and disruption for an extended period of time in some cases the markets exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain industries and issuers additionally should credit spreads widen again in the future the interest rate we must pay on any new debt obligation we may issue could increase and our net income could be reduced if the credit and capital markets continue to experience significant disruption uncertainty and instability these conditions could adversely affect our access to capital such market conditions may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner or at all andor access the capital necessary to grow our business 

  

in the unlikely event that current resources do not satisfy our needs we may have to seek additional financing or raise capital the availability of additional financing or capital will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit or capital the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the insurance industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity additionally customers lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn our access to funds may also be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorter term securities than we prefer or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility therefore as a result our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially negatively affected by disruptions in the financial markets 

  

regulatory risks 

  

our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and growth insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business the primary purpose of this supervision and regulation is the protection of our policyholders not our investors state agencies have broad administrative power over numerous aspects of our business including premium rates and other terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our insurance subsidiaries marketing practices advertising licensing agents policy forms capital adequacy solvency reserves and permitted investments also regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew or initiate procedures to revoke licenses or approvals the insurance laws regulations and policies currently 

  

affecting torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on our business we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations which may change from time to time if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines 

  

we cannot predict the timing or substance of any future regulatory initiatives in recent years there has been increased scrutiny of insurance companies including our insurance subsidiaries by insurance regulatory authorities which has included more extensive examinations and more detailed review of disclosure documents these regulatory authorities may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our agents or employees are improper these actions can result in substantial fines penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may even absent any particular regulatory authority’s interpretation of an issue changing cause us to change our views regarding the actions that we need to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to our practices that may in some cases limit our ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of our business 

  

currently the us federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance however various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed these proposals include the national insurance act of 2007 which would permit an optional federal charter for insurers in light of recent events involving certain financial institutions it is possible that the us federal government will heighten its oversight of insurers possibly through a federal system of insurance regulation we cannot predict whether this or other proposals will be adopted or what impact if any such proposals or if enacted such laws could have on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions affecting the insurance industry could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income 

  

changes in accounting standards issued by accounting standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements and reduce our profitability our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which principles are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies it is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further standard setters have a full agenda of unissued topics under review at any given time any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability 

  

if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected the collection maintenance use disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our insurance subsidiaries are regulated at the international federal and state levels these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba and in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as that term is defined in the hipaa regulations noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information whether by us or by one of our business associates could have a material 

  

adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations and could include material fines and penalties various forms of damages consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against us or our subsidiaries we are and in the future may be subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants and in certain of these matters the plaintiffs are seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages members of our management and legal teams review litigation on a quarterly and annual basis however the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark and its insurance subsidiaries do business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states in which we operate juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit 

  

our pending and future litigation could adversely affect us because of the costs of defending these cases the costs of settlement or judgments against us or changes in our operations that could result from litigation substantial legal liability in these or future legal actions could also have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation which in turn could materially harm our business and our business prospects 

  

catastrophic event risk 

  

our business is subject to the risk of the occurrence of catastrophic events our insurance policies are issued to and held by a large number of policyholders throughout the united states in relatively lowface amounts accordingly it is unlikely that a large portion of our policyholder base would be affected by a single natural disaster however our insurance operations could be exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality caused by events such as a pandemic an act of terrorism or another event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries across a wide geographic area these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and depending on their severity and geographic scope could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

  

the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total number of policyholders in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event pandemics hurricanes earthquakes and manmade catastrophes including terrorism and war may produce significant claims in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 

  

information technology risk 

  

the occurrence of computer viruses network security breaches disasters or other unanticipated events could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries and could damage our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations a computer virus could affect the data processing systems of torchmark or its subsidiaries destroying valuable data or making it difficult to conduct business in addition despite our implementation of network security measures our servers could be subject to physical and electronic breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 

  

we retain confidential information in our computer systems and rely on sophisticated commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems could access view misappropriate alter or delete information in the systems including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary 

  

business information in addition an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of unauthorized access use or disclosure of their information any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in inappropriate access use or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace deter people from purchasing our products subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical legal and other expenses 

  

in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe an industrial accident a blackout or a terrorist attack or war our computer systems may be inaccessible to our employees or customers for a period of time even if our employees are able to report to work they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

torchmark and its subsidiaries in common with the insurance industry in general are subject to litigation including claims involving tax matters alleged breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmark’s subsidiaries employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on torchmark’s financial condition future operating results or liquidity however assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forwardlooking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges juries and appellate courts in the future this bespeaks caution particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as alabama and mississippi torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business particularly alabama and mississippi creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit 

  

as previously disclosed in filings with the securities and exchange commission sec united american has been named as a defendant in purported class action litigation originally filed on september 16 2004 in the circuit court of saline county arkansas on behalf of the arkansas purchasers of association group health insurance policies or certificates issued by united american through heartland alliance of america association and farm  ranch healthcare inc  smith and ivie v collingsworth et al cv20047422 the plaintiffs asserted claims for fraudulent concealment breach of contract common law liability for nondisclosure breach of fiduciary duties civil conspiracy unjust enrichment violation of the arkansas deceptive trade practices act and violation of arkansas law and the rules and regulations of the arkansas insurance department declaratory injunctive and equitable relief as well as actual and punitive damages were sought by the plaintiffs on september 7 2005 the plaintiffs amended their complaint to assert a nationwide class defined as all united american insureds who simultaneously purchased both an individual hospital and surgical expense health insurance policy

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and to a limited extent annuities to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the major insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully described in note 13 — business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and benefit administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is 

  

net investment income 

less 

interest credited to net policy liabilities 

financing costs 

  

the tables in note 13 — business segments reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ending december 31 2009 additionally this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates yeartoyear comparability and which reconciles to net income that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business 

  

analysis of profitability by segment 

dollar amounts in thousands 

  

  

   

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations net income declined 47 million or 10 in 2009 to 405 million in 2008 net income declined 75 million or 14 to 452 million from 528 million on a diluted per share basis 2009 net income fell 5 to 488 while in 2008 per share net income declined 7 to 511 one major cause for the decline in both years was aftertax realized investment losses due mostly to writedowns of fixedmaturity securities that were determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired in 2009 aftertax realized investment losses reduced per share earnings 112 of which 127 per share related to otherthantemporary impairments of fixed maturities which were offset by 15 of net gains in 2008 aftertax losses accounted for 79 per share of which 78 related to otherthantemporary impairments in 2007 we had realized investment gains which added 02 to per diluted share earnings after otherthantemporary impairment writedowns of 08 per share offset 10 of other gains for the period another contributing factor to the declines in both years was in our health insurance segment where intense competition in recent periods has resulted in significant declines in agent counts which in turn has resulted in lower sales of new health products health underwriting margins declined 24 million or 12 in 2009 to 170 million after having decreased 14 million or 7 in 2008 

  

life insurance was our strongest performing segment in both 2009 and 2008 contributing 15 million to pretax growth in both periods margin improvements in this segment were primarily a result of premium growth the investment segment also contributed to the growth in pretax income in 2008 as excess investment income the measure of profitability of the investment segment rose 4 million however this segment’s contribution declined 31 million in 2009 as we held significantly more cash in 2009 and as a significant amount of higheryielding lowerrated investments were sold with the proceeds reinvested in loweryielding but higherrated securities in that year another factor in the 2009 decline in excess investment income was that we issued 300 million of new 9¼ debt in june and repaid our 99 million 8¼ senior debentures which matured in august 2009 resulting in increased financing costs which reduced excess investment income 

  

our annuity margins have fluctuated in recent periods our 2008 annuity underwriting loss was 6 million compared with gains of 3 million in 2009 and 9 million in 2007 in 2008 significant declines 

  

in equity markets caused variable policyholder account values to decline guaranteed minimum death benefit costs to increase policyholders to withdraw funds and changes in actuarial assumptions all of which resulted in the underwriting losses as equity markets improved during 2009 many of these factors abated somewhat and margins partially recovered we do not emphasize this segment and discontinued the sale of variable annuities in 2008 only offering a fixed annuity product 

  

total revenues declined 3 in 2009 to 322 billion in 2008 total revenues declined 5 to 333 billion from 349 billion in 2007 life premium rose 43 million in 2009 and 47 million in 2008 net investment income rose 3 million in 2009 and 23 million in 2008 however growth in revenues in both 2009 and 2008 were negatively affected by the aforementioned pretax realized investment losses and declines in health premium described further under this caption 

  

life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december 31 2009 rising 3 in 2009 to 166 billion and also 3 in 2008 margins as a percentage of premium have also held steady each year at 27 of premium life net sales rose 9 in 2009 to 327 million and 13 in 2008 to 298 million life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption life insurance 

  

we market three primary health insurance products underage65 limitedbenefit health insurance medicare supplement insurance and the medicare part d prescription drug benefit health premium declined 10 in 2009 to 102 billion from 113 billion in 2008 health premium declined 9 in 2008 the primary factor in the decreases in both years was the decline in agent count in our united american branch office during the year our largest health producer this agency has experienced intense competition which has resulted in a significant decrease in new health sales and has negatively impacted premium income this agency had historically focused on sales of our limitedbenefit health product as demand for this product had increased accordingly premium from the limitedbenefit product grew significantly in relation to medicare supplement premium in recent years however with the decline in the size of this agency beginning in 2007 premium for the limitedbenefit product has declined medicare supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium but increased competition has also dampened sales of this product resulting in premium declines in each successive year it should be noted however that net sales for medicare supplement insurance rose in 2009 for the first time in several years this was a result of the increase in group medical supplement sales we also offer medicare part d insurance as most of the country’s part d enrollees selected a plan provider in 2006 we do not expect significant growth in our part d business going forward see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

  

as noted earlier we no longer offer variable annuities while we still offer fixed annuities we do not emphasize sales of annuity products favoring life insurance instead see the caption annuities for further discussion of the annuity segment 

  

as previously mentioned the investment segment’s pretax profitability or excess investment income increased 4 million in 2008 but declined 31 million in 2009 profitability in this segment is based on three major components net investment income required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to and assigned to insurance products and financing costs in recent years growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio one of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of another factor that has contributed to the relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested during these lags we have held cash at lower yields among the most important factors contributing to the relatively lower growth rate in investment income during 2009 is the fact that due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets we held significantly more cash and short term investments during 2009 than we did during 2008 and 2007 additionally in 2009 we sold a significant portion of higheryielding but lowerrated fixed maturities and reinvested the proceeds in loweryielding but higherrated bonds in 2009 to improve our riskadjusted return this also contributed to reduced net investment income the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income and generally grows in conjunction with the insurance policy reserves that are supported by the invested assets financing costs which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and shortterm debt are also deducted from excess investment income in 2009 interest expense 

  

on our longterm debt rose 11 million during the year we issued our 300 million 9 1  4  senior notes but repaid our 99 million 8 1  4  senior debentures resulting in a higher balance of debt outstanding at a higher interest rate however this segment has benefited from lower shortterm financing costs in each successive year as these costs have declined primarily due to lower rates on our shortterm debt prior to 2009 growth in total investment income has been somewhat negatively affected by torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments 

  

torchmark’s current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investmentgrade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives approximately 92 of our invested assets at fair value consists of fixed maturities of which 94 was investment grade at december 31 2009 the average quality rating of the portfolio was bbb the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alta mortgages no direct investment in residential mortgages no counterparty risks no credit default swaps or derivative contracts see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and n ote 3—investments in the notes to consolidated statements of operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment 

  

as mentioned earlier in this summary we wrote down certain securities in each of the years 2007 through 2009 as these securities met our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment the pretax impairment losses were 160 million 106 million and 11 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively please refer to note 3—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption otherthantemporary impairments and under the caption realized gains and losses in this report for more information on these writedowns and our criteria for consideration of otherthantemporary impairment including the writedowns we had total aftertax realized investment losses of 93 million in 2009 112 per share and 70 million in 2008 79 per share compared with a 2 million gain in 2007 02 per share realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and may have a material positive or negative impact on net income under the caption realized gains and losses in this report we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses including the writedowns also as explained in note 13—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments 

  

during the second quarter of 2009 we issued a new debt security our 9 1  4  senior notes par value 300 million funds from this offering were used to repay our 8 1  4  senior debentures which matured in the third quarter of 2009 in the amount of 99 million we also used 175 million to strengthen the capital position of certain of our insurance subsidiaries in the form of capital contributions and surplus notes the regulatory capital positions of these subsidiaries had been negatively affected by ratingagency downgrades of bonds in their investment portfolios the subsidiaries in turn invested these funds in investmentgrade fixed maturities more information on these transactions can be found in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 

  

in each of the years 2007 through 2009 net income was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring nonoperating items we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations a discussion of these items follows 

  

as reported in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption litigation and tax settlements  we have been involved in a number of litigation issues over the course of the three year period 2007 through 2009 in which we either received settlements net of expenses or incurred settlement losses and expenses these issues resulted in aftertax charges of 770 thousand in 2008 and 272 thousand in 2007 additionally as described under the same caption of note 1 we received tax settlements in each year in the amounts of 29 million in 2009 108 million in 2008 and 11 million in 2007 all of these litigation and tax issues pertained to issues arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations legal and litigation expenses pertaining to current operations are included in either insurance administrative expenses or parent expenses as appropriate in our segment analysis income from 

  

litigation settlements is included in other income as explained in note 3—investments under the caption otherthantemporary impairments  we wrote down certain companyoccupied property to fair value during both 2009 and 2008 the write downs resulted in aftertax charges of 231 thousand in 2009 and 14 million in 2008 

  

prior to 2007 liberty began a program to dispose of its agency office buildings replacing them with rental facilities in 2007 21 buildings were sold for proceeds of 64 million and a pretax gain of 43 million 28 million after tax the program began to wind down in 2008 as five buildings were sold for proceeds of 787 thousand and a pretax gain of 278 thousand 181 thousand after tax because of the significant scale of this nonoperating activity we have removed these amounts from our core results in 2008 and 2007 no buildings were sold in 2009 five buildings remained to be sold at december 31 2009 

  

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises due to economic conditions at the time we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2009 we may resume the program with a reaffirmation by the board of directors when share repurchases are determined to be the best use of cash the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december 31 2009

throughout the remainder of this discussion share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings 

  

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows 

  

life insurance life insurance is our largest insurance segment with 2009 life premium representing 62 of total premium life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 72 of the total in 2009 additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

throughout 2009 we have been in the process of combining selected united american ua exclusive agency branch offices with the liberty national exclusive agency for this reason all premium income and margin data will be reported on a combined basis in this report however we will continue to report sales data and agent counts separately 

  

life insurance premium rose 3 to 17 billion in 2009 after having increased 3 in 2008 to 162 billion life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue net sales is annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

  

annualized life premium in force was 177 billion at december 31 2009 an increase of 4 over 171 billion a year earlier annualized life premium in force was 167 billion at december 31 2007

direct response is one of our leading writers of life insurance the direct response operation consists of two primary components direct mail and insert media direct mail targets primarily young middleincome households with children the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time at this time we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response’s premier markets 

  

the insert media area targets primarily the adult market it involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media such as coupon packets newspapers bank statements and billings this media was historically placed by direct marketing and advertising distributors inc dmad previously an unrelated entity which we acquired and integrated their operations into ours during 2007 this acquisition allowed the company to expand marketing opportunities through increased solicitation volume and also improve margins through cost savings in the insert media component 

  

the direct response operation accounted for 32 of our life insurance premium during 2009 the largest of any distribution group life premium for this channel rose 5 in 2009 and 6 in 2008 net sales rose 7 in 2009 to 132 million after an 8 gain in 2008 to 123 million firstyear collected premium increased 6 in 2009 to 85 million after a 5 gain in 2008 

  

the american income exclusive agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions but also on credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios life premium for this agency rose 7 to 508 million in 2009 after having increased 8 in 2008 net sales increased 18 in 2009 to 128 million from 108 million in 2008 net sales rose 17 in 2008 firstyear collected premium rose 17 in 2009 to 96 million after having increased 11 in 2008 as in the case of all of torchmark’s agency distribution systems continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count growth in the agent count has contributed to the improvements in sales in this agency the american income agent count was 4154 at december 31 2009 compared with 3085 a year earlier an increase of 35 the agent count rose 21 in 2008 from 2545 at year end 2007 this agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business additionally the systematic centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents 

  

as previously mentioned we have combined selected ua exclusive agency branch offices with the liberty national exclusive agency  the liberty national agency has historically marketed life insurance to middleincome customers primarily in the southeast the ua branch office agency has historically emphasized health products but is now changing its focus for newly recruited agents to market liberty national’s life and health products in addition due to ongoing cuts in medicare advantage funding and changes to the competitive environment in the medicare supplement market we have also recently renewed our emphasis on medicare supplement sales life premium income for this combined agency was 

  

298 million for 2009 a 2 decrease compared with 304 million in 2008 life premium for this agency declined 2 in 2008 from 2007 firstyear collected premium on a combined basis rose 6 to 35 million in 2009 after having increased 8 in 2008 

  

liberty national’s net sales declined 5 to 46 million in 2009 after having increased 31 a year earlier the liberty agency had 1740 producing agents at december 31 2009 compared with 3369 a year earlier a decline of 48 the agent count at liberty had increased 40 in 2008 from 2410 the 2009 decrease in agent count was due primarily to agent compensation issues a twotier bonus threshold proved more difficult for producing agents to meet than anticipated management reverted to a level bonus threshold during the third quarter of 2009 in addition due to deteriorating first year persistency rates on business written over the past several quarters management modified compensation incentives in the third quarter of 2009 to place more emphasis on retention this has resulted in the departure of some of the weaker agents management expects the counts to increase in 2010 

  

the ua branch office agency produced net sales of 92 million in 2009 of liberty national’s life products as noted earlier this agency traditionally focused on health product sales due to intense competition in recent periods in the health insurance market the ua branch has experienced sharp declines in agent count the ua branch office agency had 731 producing agents at december 31 2009 compared with 1651 agents a year earlier a decline of 56 the count declined 45 in 2008 from 2979 agents 

  

as is the case with all of our captive agency forces growing the number of productive agents is critical to the growth in sales as mentioned above we have shifted the emphasis in the ua branch office agency to life and health products currently marketed by liberty national agents as well as a renewed focus on medicare supplement products these products are priced to achieve higher profit margins and have better persistency than the ua branch’s limitedbenefit health insurance this agency will continue to offer the current product portfolio but the majority of our financial incentives will be used to encourage new agents to sell the liberty national product line along with the renewed focus on ua medicare supplement products we believe this will improve the stability and profitability of the ua branch office agency 

  

we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the united investors agency the military agency the united american independent agency and other small miscellaneous sales agencies the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business united investors represented 4 of torchmark’s 2009 life premium income the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of wholelife products with term insurance riders military premium represented 12 of life premium the united american independent agency represented less than 2 of torchmark’s total life premium this agency is focused on health insurance with life sales being incidental

gross margins as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense rose 4 in 2009 to 447 million after also rising 4 in 2008 as a percentage of life insurance premium gross margins have been stable each year at 27 margin growth in all periods was primarily the result of premium growth 

  

health insurance health products sold by torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limitedbenefit cancer accident plans and hospitalsurgical plans sold to people under age 65 we also sell medicare supplements to enrollees in the federal medicare program as well as providing coverage under the medicare part d prescription drug program the limitedbenefit health plans generally provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined a fixedamount surgical schedule outpatient coverage and other miscellaneous hospitalrelated charges they also contain caps on total perillness benefits consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual majormedical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limitedbenefit plans are generally lower than those of medicare supplement however the medicare supplement product has historically had slightly higher persistency rates resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium in recent years sales of the underage65 limitedbenefit product have exceeded medicare supplement sales as customers demand for the limitedbenefit product increased and price competition and reduced demand for medicare supplements dampened sales of that product however medicare supplement continues to be our largest health product in terms of premium income additionally in the past two years medicare supplement sales have grown steadily in relation to limitedbenefit sales due in part to changes in agent counts in our health distribution groups discussed below 

  

total health premium represented 38 of torchmark’s total premium income in 2009 excluding part d premium health premium represented 33 in 2009 compared with 37 in 2008 and 39 in 2007 health underwriting margin excluding part d accounted for 25 of the total in 2009 compared with 29 in 2008 and 30 in 2007 these declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment health results have also been negatively affected by increased competition in recent periods the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years

health insurance excluding medicare part d as noted under the caption life insurance  we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health due to life’s superior margins and other benefits our health distribution groups have also encountered increased competition in recent periods the increased competition has led to losses in agents in our ua branch office and independent agencies agent turnover has increased as lower premium lower margin products offered by competitors have provided agents with products that are easier to sell declines in these agent counts have resulted in lower net sales which in turn have pressured premium growth health premium excluding part d premium fell 12 to 837 million in 2009 after declining 8 in 2008 medicare supplement premium declined 6 to 458 million in 2009 compared with a 7 decline in 2008 other limitedbenefit health premium dropped 18 in 2009 to 378 million after a decline of 9 in 2008 net sales excluding medicare part d declined 30 to 97 million in 2009 net sales fell 42 in 2008 to 139 million medicare supplement net sales rose 64 in 2009 however while other health net sales declined 54 in 2008 both medicare supplement and other health net sales declined medicare supplement declined 14 and other limitedbenefit health fell 46 first year collected premium also declined significantly in both 2009 and 2008 

  

while new sales of our limitedbenefit health products have been stronger than our medicare supplement plans medicare supplement net sales have been gaining in recent periods in relation to 

  

other limitedbenefit products medicare supplement provides the greatest amount of health premium representing 55 of nonpart d health premium in 2009 because medicare supplement products are generally more persistent than the limitedbenefit products medicare supplement premium grew to 55 in relative proportion to limitedbenefit premium in 2009 compared with 51 for the two prior years 

  

as previously mentioned under the caption life insurance  we have combined selected ua exclusive agency branch offices with the liberty national exclusive agency  this combination has resulted in this agency being torchmark’s largest in terms of health premium income and net sales in 2009 this agency represented 46 of all torchmark nonpart d income health premium at 389 million the ua branch has historically been torchmark’s largest health distributor marketing limitedbenefit health products and medicare supplements liberty also markets limitedbenefit products concentrating on cancer insurance in 2009 health premium income of 389 million in the combined agency declined 18 from prior year premium of 476 million premium also fell 10 in 2008 from 528 million firstyear collected premium fell 62 to 33 million in 2009 after declining 36 a year earlier as noted earlier increased competition in the health insurance market has caused declines in agent counts particularly in the ua branch agency the decline in agent counts has resulted in decreased new sales translating into declines in premium the ua branch office net sales for 2009 declined 75 from 72 million in 2008 to 18 million of which 5 million was for sales of liberty national products in 2009 in 2008 this agency’s net sales fell 56 as discussed under the caption life insurance  the ua branch office agent count has fallen significantly each year 45 in 2008 to 1651 agents and 56 in 2009 to 731 agents these declines have negatively impacted net sales and premium growth this effect has been more notable in torchmark’s health segment as this agency is a more prominent factor in our health operations also discussed under the life insurance caption are efforts designed to strengthen this agency 

  

liberty’s health net sales were relatively flat in 2009 but rose 22 to 12 million in 2008 on sales of limitedbenefit health products primarily cancer liberty’s net sales as a portion of total nonpart d health net sales rose from 4 in 2007 to 9 in 2008 to 13 in 2009 

  

the ua independent agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large multistate organizations down to oneperson offices all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies of which 1872 were active producing agents for torchmark at december 31 2009 this agency is our largest carrier of medicare supplement insurance with 266 million or 58 of our medicare supplement premium income in 2009 this agency’s relative contribution to torchmark’s total health sales has increased in each of the past three years net sales for this agency rose 14 to 43 million in 2009 medicare supplement net sales of 30 million more than doubled in 2009 over net sales of 15 million in 2008 and almost doubled sales of 16 million in 2007 these increases in 2009 were due to increases in group medicare supplement sales total health premium income for the ua independent agency was 326 million in 2009 a 9 decline from 2008 premium of 357 million premium income declined 8 in 2008 from 2007 the declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses 

  

the american income exclusive agency also predominantly a life insurance distribution channel is our third largest health insurance distributor based on 2009 premium collected its health plans are comprised of various limitedbenefit plans for which approximately 69 of the agency’s 2009 health premium was from accident policies sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 

  

health premium at this agency rose 2 in 2009 to 75 million after having increased 4 to 73 million in 2008 net health sales were 13 million in 2009 compared with 12 million in 2008 and 11 million in 2007 net health sales comprised less than 10 of the american income agency’s total net sales in 2009 

  

direct response  primarily a life operation also offers health insurance which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups in 2009 net health sales were 11 million comprising approximately 8 of direct response’s total life and health net sales direct response health net sales and premium income have risen each year over the prior year net sales increased 87 in 2009 and 7 in 2008 health premium rose 3 in 2009 to 47 million and 7 in 2008 

  

medicare part d torchmark through its subsidiary united american began offering insurance coverage under the government’s medicare part d plan as of january 1 2006 the medicare part d plan 

  

is a standalone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american unlike the traditional medicare program for hospital and doctor services where cms is the primary insurer and private medicare supplement insurers are secondary insurers the program generally calls for cms to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium total medicare part d premium was 184 million in 2009 compared with 176 million in 2008 and 215 million in 2007 changes in part d premium generally result from changes in the number of enrollees enrollment for all part d coverages ends on december 31 of the previous year except for enrollees who reach age 65 in the current year at december 2009 united american had approximately 158 thousand enrollees for the 2010 part d plan compared with 147 thousand for the 2009 plan year and 158 thousand for the 2008 plan year our medicare part d product is sold primarily through the direct response operation but is also sold by the ua independent agency part d net sales were 43 million in 2009 compared with 28 million in 2008 and 25 million in 2007 we count only sales to new firsttime enrollees in net sales and the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees 

  

we believe that the medicare part d program is a meaningful component to our health product offerings because of our experience with the seniorage market and with medicare supplements the government assurances with regard to the risksharing agreements for participating insurers the incremental income added to our health insurance margins and the renewal of the business every year due to our experience with service to the seniorage market and the use of our existing direct response marketing system entry to this business required little new investment however we do not expect significant growth in the part d product in the near future as most medicare beneficiaries have already chosen a plan additionally as with any governmentsponsored program the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market

annuities fixed annuity products are sold on a limited basis by our subsidiaries variable annuities were sold prior to 2008 but new sales were discontinued during that year annuities represented less than 1 of torchmark’s 2009 premium revenue and underwriting income we do not emphasize this segment

variable annuities generate earnings from periodic policy charges and fees to the account balances reduced by net policy obligations and acquisition costs instability and declines in equity markets over the past two years have had a significant negative effect on the average variable annuity policyholder account balance especially in 2008 as market volatility has resulted in declines in the value of the underlying investments and caused increased policyholder withdrawals as noted above we also withdrew from the variable annuity market in 2008 and no longer market these products these events have pressured annuity revenues and accordingly underwriting income in 2009 and particularly in 2008 

  

underwriting income on our variable business has been recently affected by two major factors other than policy charges our products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits providing a minimum death benefit regardless of policyholder account value upon death for this reason we provide a reserve for this benefit the cost of which increases as the policyholder account value declines additionally because of changes in the account balance size we expect that future revenues and profits will also change accordingly therefore the projections with regard to the deferred acquisition costs associated with this business are revised resulting in a charge or credit to reflect this revision or “trueup” of the projections because equity markets declined significantly in the latter part of 2008 the guaranteed death benefit and the “trueup” related to deferred acquisition costs increased substantially in 2008 from 935 thousand in 2007 to 136 million as a result of the partial recovery of the equity markets in 2009 the charge to underwriting income for the guaranteed death benefit reserve adjustment and “trueup” adjustment was reduced to 17 million the variable annuity business is our only business where revenue and margins are significantly impacted by changes in equity markets 

  

while the fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year policy charges and underwriting income have fluctuated only modestly the stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist of surrender charges and are not based on account size these charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements which can result in negative net policy obligations in 2009 investment income for fixed annuities increased as a result of the assignment of higheryielding new investments to this product as older loweryielding investments matured and rolled off over time as the income has grown at a greater rate than the fund balance the spread has widened the amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits 

  

administrative expenses operating expenses are included in the other and corporate segments and are classified into two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company the following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2009 

  

operating expenses selected information 

dollar amounts in thousands 

  

   

insurance administrative expenses declined 3 in 2009 after having risen 3 in 2008 as a percentage of premium they declined to 57 in 2009 after having risen from 55 in 2007 to 58 in 2008 in 2009 increases in salaries were more than offset by declines in other administrative costs and other employee costs as a result of the effort to achieve greater consistency in expense classification among our subsidiaries we deferred 12 million more of deferrable administrative expense to acquisition expense in 2009 compared with 2008 these reductions in administrative expense were partially offset by increases in pension and other employee benefit costs during the period the additional deferred costs will increase the amortization of acquisition costs in future periods the 2008 increase was primarily a result of higher salary expenses pension costs and other costs such as postage and property taxes the 2008 increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses and medicare part d administrative expense management believes that pension cost will stabilize in 2010 because of the partial recovery in financial markets 

  

parent company expense was lower in 2009 than in the two prior periods included in 2008 and 2007 expenses were charges in the amount of 29 million in 2008 and 16 million in 2007 for expenses incurred related to potential acquisition bids that were not successful 

  

as mentioned in note 1— significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we settled litigation in prior periods relating to issues occurring many years ago but incurred 25 million in legal costs in 2008 and 933 thousand in 2007 as previously noted we do not consider the costs of settling litigation applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations stock compensation expense declined in 2009 primarily as a result of the lower stock price caused by the severe market decline in 2009 and the effect it had on values at the time of our annual stock and stock option grants for 2009 expense related to the new 2009 grants replaced the expense for costlier older grants that became fully vested stock compensation expense rose in 2008 because 2008 was the first year after adoption of the accounting rule requiring the expensing of stock options where we had three years of annual employee grants being expensed 2005 2006 and 2008 the 2004 employee grant was fully vested in 2005 before adoption and there was no grant in 2007 new restricted stock grants in each of the three years 2006 through 2008 which generally vest over five years have also contributed to the increases in 2008 and 2007 stock compensation expense management believes that stock compensation expense will increase slightly in 2010 as stated in note 13—business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense and therefore treats it as a parent company expense as described in note 3—investments under the caption otherthantemporary impairments  we wrote down certain companyoccupied real estate because it met our criteria as described in that note for otherthantemporary impairment as a result we incurred a pretax charge of 21 million in 2008 and 355 thousand in 2009 which is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the respective year 

  

investments we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 1 3— business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used 40 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  

  

    

excess investment income decreased 31 million or 9 in 2009 over the prior year excess investment income rose 4 million or 1 in 2008 on a per diluted share basis 2009 excess investment income declined 4 to 358 share purchases caused the decline in per share excess investment income in 2009 to be less than the decline in total excess investment income and the increase in per share excess investment income to be greater than the increase in total excess investment income in 2007 and 2008 per share excess investment income increased 10 in 2008 and 7 in 2007 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income which rose 1 to 675 million in 2009 it increased 35 to 671 million in 2008 from 649 million in 2007 as presented in the following chart the growth in net investment income in all periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets 

  

   

one of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of another factor that has contributed to the relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested one of the most important factors contributing to the relatively lower growth rate in investment income during 2009 is the fact that due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets we held significantly more cash and short term investments during 2009 than we did during 2008 and 2007 had we not done so and if short term investment rates had not been much lower during 2009 than in 2008 the growth rate in investment income during 2009 would have been approximately the same as the growth rate in mean assets 

  

  

excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 

  

interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

    

the average interest crediting rate has risen in each of the last three years in 2001 as part of our normal review of policy reserve assumptions we increased the interest rate assumption 100 basis points 1 on policies issued after january 1 2001 as this group of policies becomes a larger proportion of our business the average crediting rate will continue to increase for more specific information on life and health crediting rates please refer to note 5—future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs 

  

reconciliation of interest expense to financing costs

the table below presents the components of financing costs 

  

analysis of financing costs 

amounts in thousands 

  

   

financing costs rose 7 million or 11 in 2009 they declined 4 million or 6 in 2008 the 2009 increase in financing costs reflects the issuance in june 2009 of 300 million principal amount 9 ¼ senior notes due in 2019 and the maturity in august 2009 of 99 million principal amount 8 ¼ senior debentures shortterm interest expense was 4 million lower in 2009 as a result of significantly lower interest rates when compared with 2008 the 2008 decline resulted from a decrease in shortterm interest rates during 2008 as well as a 4 decline in our average commercial paper balance for the year to 229 million 

  

excess investment income benefits from increases in longterm rates available on new investments and decreases in shortterm borrowing rates of these two factors higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at shortterm rates 

  

investment acquisitions  torchmark’s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investmentgrade fixed maturities generally with long maturities maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date that meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities we believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable if such longerterm securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives new money is invested shortterm generally with maturities less than five years during calendar years 2007 through 2009 torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities investments were primarily made in corporate securities although some municipal bonds were acquired in 2007 and 2009 there were virtually no belowinvestmentgrade securities acquired and the average rating of investments acquired in each year was a investmentgrade corporate securities include both bonds and trustpreferred securities which are classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors 

  

the following table summarizes selected information for fixedmaturity purchases the effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield this date is commonly known as the “worst call date” two different average life calculations are shown average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date 

  

fixed maturity acquisitions selected information 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether or not and if so when the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment however the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 

  

during 2007 and 2008 we invested considerable funds in fixedmaturity securities bonds trust preferred securities and redeemable preferred stocks with longer scheduled maturity dates often exceeding 30 years in virtually all cases such securities have a scheduled maturity date and are callable many years prior to the scheduled maturity date because of the changing investment environment later in 2009 we were able to achieve our yield and quality objectives with investments in securities with somewhat shorter average lives and maturities as a result the average life of funds invested during 2009 to both next call and maturity was somewhat lower than that of investments during 2007 and 2008 

  

new cash flow available to us for investment has been affected by issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past three years especially 2007 issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost calls increase funds available for investment but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called issuer calls were 181 million in 2009 238 million in 2008 and 848 million in 2007 the 2007 level of calls was unusual and contributed to the significant increase in funds invested in that year the higher level of acquisitions in 2009 was primarily due to the additional cash flow available from the special sales transactions noted below 

  

sales transactions as disclosed in note 3—investments  the company sold 758 million of fixed maturities at amortized cost in the third quarter of 2009 including 315 million of below investmentgrade securities the market value for some of these securities increased significantly during the period to a level where even though the sales price was less than amortized cost management determined that better riskadjusted returns could be achieved by selling rather than continuing to hold the securities other securities were sold at prices that produced gains to offset these losses for tax purposes due in large part to selling belowinvestmentgrade securities and reinvesting the proceeds in investmentgrade securities belowinvestmentgrade securities as a percentage of total fixed maturities at amortized cost declined from 13 at june 30 2009 to 8 at december 31 2009 the reduction in belowinvestmentgrade securities had a positive impact on the riskbased capital position of our insurance subsidiaries 

  

portfolio analysis because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms the following table presents a comparison of torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2009 with the latest industry data 

  

   

at december 31 2009 approximately 93 of our investments at book value were in a diversified fixedmaturity portfolio policy loans which are secured by policy cash values made up an additional 4 the remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities mortgage loans and other longterm and shortterm investments 

  

because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities an analysis of our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 is as follows

at december 31 2009 fixed maturities had a fair value of 97 billion compared with 78 billion at december 31 2008 net unrealized losses on fixed maturities declined from 18 billion at december 31 2008 to 456 million at december 31 2009 approximately 74 of our fixed maturity assets at december 31 2009 at amortized cost were corporate bonds and 14 were redeemable preferred stocks this compares with 78 corporate bonds and 15 redeemable preferred stocks at year end 2008 at december 31 2009 less than 2 of the assets at amortized cost were residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities other assetbacked securities and collateralized debt obligations cdos the 55 million of cdos at amortized cost made up less than 1 of the assets and are backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies the 22 million of mortgagebacked securities are rated aaa for more information about our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2009 and 2008 including an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities see note 3—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

additional information concerning the fixedmaturity portfolio is as follows 

  

fixed maturity portfolio selected information 

  

   

the increase in effective duration during 2009 was due in large part to significantly lower discount rates implied by the increase in the market value of the portfolio which increases sensitivity to changes in rates 

  

credit risk sensitivity credit risk is the level of certainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity approximately 89 of our fixedmaturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities including redeemable preferred and assetbacked securities as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities credit risk is a concern we mitigate this ongoing risk in part by acquiring investmentgrade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis we also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors 

  

the following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at december 31 2009 

  

   

at december 31 2009 approximately 38 of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost 34 at fair value were in the financial sector including 17 in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 16 in banks at amortized cost financial guarantors mortgage insurers and insurance brokers comprised approximately 2 of the portfolio after financials the next largest sector was utilities which comprised 14 of the portfolio at amortized cost the balance of the portfolio is spread among 266 issuers in a wide variety of sectors as previously noted gross unrealized losses were 723 million at december 31 2009 declining from 19 billion a year earlier approximately 60 of the decrease in net unrealized loss was attributable to improvements in valuations in nonfinancial sectors since yearend 2008 and 40 was due to a partial recovery in the net unrealized loss position of our financial holdings as discussed in note 3 —investments  we believe much of the unrealized losses in recent periods were attributable to illiquidity in the financial markets we expect to recover the full book value of our investments in impaired securities 

  

as shown in the table above the ratio of gross unrealized losses to book value was greater than 50 for our investments in cdos and the financial guarantormortgage insurer monoline insurer sectors we evaluated each of the impaired securities in these and all other sectors to determine whether or not any of 

  

the impairments were otherthantemporary certain information about our evaluation of the impaired securities in the cdo and monoline insurer sectors is provided in the following paragraphs 

  

at december 31 2009 we held investments in five different cdos in our opinion our investments in four of these cdos 34 million amortized cost and 13 million fair value were otherthantemporarily impaired and our investment in one cdo 21 million amortized cost and 5 million fair value was not otherthantemporarily impaired in reaching this conclusion we reviewed and discussed with the collateral managers for each of these cdos the current status of the collateral underlying our investments the credit events defaults and deferrals in underlying collateral experienced to date and the possibility of future credit events we calculated expected future cash flows using assumptions for expected future credit events that reflect actual historical experience and expected future experience we reviewed the actual versus expected cash flows received to date and the impact that potential future credit events would have on our expected future cash flows we calculated the magnitude of future credit events that could be experienced without negatively impacting the recovery of our investment and our expected yield rate while there is a possibility that future credit events will exceed our current expectations we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions 

  

also at december 31 2009 we held investments issued by five different monoline insurers in our opinion our investments in three of these monoline insurers 9 million amortized cost and 10 million fair value were otherthantemporarily impaired and our investments in two monoline insurers 83 million amortized cost and 37 million fair value were not otherthantemporarily impaired we collected and analyzed a significant amount of information to form opinions about the reasons for the severity of our impairments including the illiquidity of some of our holdings and its impact on fair values the expected future experience in the mortgage market and the reasonable expectation of the receipt of all future contractual interest and principal payments for these investments we reviewed news and information about the economy and the mortgage market in general and about the issuers of our investments we reviewed and analyzed financial statements and had discussions with sellside and independent credit analysts who follow this sector certain regulators and members of the management teams of some of the issuers of our investments while there is a possibility that future experience in the mortgage markets will differ from our current expectations we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions 

  

at december 31 2009 our internal rating for a security was determined as the average of the security’s rating from four nationally recognized rating agencies the ratings from each agency are evenly weighted when calculating the average and the average is rounded to the nearest rating when it is between two ratings in prior years the average was rounded down to the next lower rating when it was between two ratings the ratings methodology was changed in 2009 to more accurately reflect the average ratings of the securities and to make ratings by category be more consistent with the statutory ratings which are instrumental in determining the regulatory required capital for our insurance subsidiaries under the new rating methodology belowinvestmentgrade bonds would have been 6 of the fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2008 at amortized cost compared with 7 based on the prior rating methodology 

  

an analysis of the fixedmaturity portfolio by a composite rating at december 31 2009 is shown in the table below 

  

fixed maturities by rating 

at december 31 2009 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

the portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of bbb based on amortized cost approximately 92 of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by subprime or alta mortgages loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower we have no direct investments in residential mortgages nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts we do not participate in securities lending there are no offbalance sheet investments as all investments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets  at december 31 2009 we had 18 million at fair value  55 million book value invested in cdos for which the composite rating at that date was cc the collateral underlying these cdos is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies but no subprime or alta mortgages are included in the collateral 

  

our current investment policy is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

  

market risk sensitivity torchmark’s financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since 93 of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixedmaturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixedrate investments the portfolio is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value under normal market conditions we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however in accordance with gaap these liabilities are not marked to market 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2009 and 2008 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points 

  

   

realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits we also incur acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

because our investment portfolio is large and diverse investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses occur only incidentally usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the periodtoperiod trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results 

  

the following table summarizes our taxeffected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2009

as described in note 3— investments under the caption otherthan temporary impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we wrote certain securities down to fair value during each year 2007 through 2009 as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in note 3 and in our critical accounting policies in this report the writedowns resulted in pretax charges of 160 million in 2009 105 million after tax 106 million in 2008 69 million after tax and 11 million in 2007 7 million after tax the 2009 charge included 83 million on cdos 55 million after tax and 36 million on monoline financial guarantors and mortgage insurers 23 million after tax the remaining writedowns in 2009 were from losses on a variety of corporate bonds in 2008 the significant bonds written down were lehman brothers bonds of 74 million pretax 48 million after tax and washington mutual bonds of 19 million pretax 12 million after tax other writedowns in 2008 included perpetual preferred stocks of federal national mortgage association and certain nonfinancial securities impairment losses on fixed maturities in 2007 were related to nonfinancial institution holdings 

  

additionally as described in note 3  we wrote down a real estate investment to fair value in 2008 resulting in a loss of 11 million 718 thousand after tax we wrote down an additional 205 thousand 133 thousand after tax in 2009 on this investment 

  

financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes 

  

insurance subsidiary liquidity the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes the funds to provide for policy benefits the majority of which are paid in future periods are invested primarily in longterm fixed maturities to meet these longterm obligations in addition to investment income maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries’ operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company subject to regulatory restriction the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries’ prior year earnings calculated on a statutory basis 

  

parent company liquidity an important source of cash flow to the parent company is dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries noted above these dividends are used to pay parent company dividends on common and preferred stock interest and principal repayments on parent company debt and operating expenses of the parent in 2009 355 million in dividends were paid to the parent company as compared with 404 million in 2008 and 458 million in 2007 after paying debt obligations shareholder dividends and other expenses but before share repurchases torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in 2009 of approximately 281 million parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases in 2010 it is expected that the parent company will receive 360 million in dividends from subsidiaries and that approximately 270 million will be available as excess cash flow certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 11 — shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company 

  

an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 600 million as of december 31 2009 we had available 167 million under this facility for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility see the commercial paper section of note 10 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

during the first half of 2009 until early june torchmark qualified for and participated in the commercial paper funding facility cpff a facility created by the federal reserve board to purchase commercial paper from eligible issuers one condition of participation was that we maintain our commercial paper credit ratings as of june 5 2009 one agency downgraded our commercial paper facility by one notch as a result we no longer qualified to issue commercial paper in the cpff after that date however the company has been able to issue commercial paper in the public market since that time at a considerably lower cost than through the government program we issued over one billion dollars of commercial paper during the second half of 2009 at an average yield of 06 compared with an average yield of 17 during the first half of 2009 which was primarily issued under the cpff the downgrade has not had an impact on our ability to access public commercial paper markets 

  

in summary torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2010 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including but not limited to the issuance of additional debt a shortterm credit facility and intercompany borrowing 

  

consolidated liquidity  consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were 976 million in 2009 compared with 731 million in 2008 and 850 million in 2007 in addition to cash inflows from operations our companies have received 243 million in investment calls and tenders and 518 million of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2009 maturities tenders and calls totaled 581 million in 2008 and 13 billion in 2007 

  

our cash and shortterm investments were 590 million at yearend 2009 and 177 million at yearend 2008 additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 97 billion at december 31 2009 however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as fully described and discussed in note 10 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt torchmark had outstanding 120 million par amount 71 trust preferred securities at both december 31 2009 and 2008 the capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders the trust is an offbalance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules deconsolidation is required because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest therefore torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity even though we own all of the entity’s voting equity and have guaranteed the entity’s performance while these liabilities are not on our consolidated balance sheets  they are represented by torchmark’s 71 junior subordinated debentures due to the trust these junior subordinated debentures were a torchmark liability of 124 million par and book value at both december 31 2009 and 2008 these securities are indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption capital resources in this report the 71 preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our 71 interest payment on our debt to the trusts as described in note 14 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 

  

as a part of its abovementioned credit facility torchmark has outstanding 200 million in standby letters of credit however these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole 

  

as of december 31 2009 we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of thirdparty entities other than as described above all of our guarantees other than the trust preferred guarantee were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 14 — commitments and contingencies 

  

the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december 31 2009

capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in note 10 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements longterm funded debt junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities and shareholders’ equity the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark’s capital trust iii which is liable for its trust preferred securities in accordance with gaap these instruments are included in “due to affiliates” on the consolidated balance sheets a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

the carrying value of the funded debt was  920 million at december 31 2009 compared with 722 million a year earlier our 8 1  4  senior debentures matured and were repaid in august 2009 at a redemption amount of 99 million plus accrued interest at year end 2008 they were classified as shortterm debt because they were due within a year as a result reported longterm debt at december 31 2008 was 499 million 

  

as fully explained in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  in june of 2009 we issued 300 million principal amount of 9¼ senior notes due in 2019 for proceeds of 296 million as noted above a portion of these proceeds were used to repay the 99 million due upon the august 2009 maturity of our 8¼ senior debentures of the 197 million balance of the proceeds 175 million was contributed to our insurance subsidiaries in 2009 the subsidiaries then in turn invested these funds in investmentgrade corporate bonds and municipal bonds the capital contributions were made as a result of our desire to maintain subsidiary regulatory capital at levels adequate to meet the requirements of rating agencies 

  

poor economic conditions experienced during 2009 caused the ratings of many bonds in our insurance subsidiaries’ portfolios to be downgraded and have also resulted in increased otherthan 

  

temporary impairments taken because of the large volume of ratings downgrades and impairments these items have had a significant negative effect on the subsidiaries’ regulatory capital the subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 300 of required regulatory capital under riskbased capital rbc a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital the 300 target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows the relatively low risk of their product mix and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark rbc has been favorably impacted by these capital contributions and the sales of belowinvestmentgrade securities discussed under the caption investments—sales transactions in this report at december 31 2009 our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had rbc ratios in excess of 350 should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future and the ratio falls below 300 management could utilize cash on hand at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 300 

  

due to its strong liquidity and capital position torchmark has no intent at this point in time to issue equity and in fact has recently declared an increase in its dividend on it common stock from 14 to 15 per share each quarter as noted under the caption highlights in this report we suspended our share repurchase program indefinitely in march 2009 due to general economic conditions at that time reactivation of this program is subject to board approval no share purchases have been made since march 2009 however we did acquire 2 million shares at a cost of 47 million 2278 per share in the first quarter of 2009 under the program share purchases in 2008 and 2007 were more significant as we acquired 8 million shares for 427 million in 2008 and 6 million shares in 2007 for 402 million under the program please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption highlights in this report 

  

shareholders’ equity was 34 billion at december 31 2009 compared with 22 billion at december 31 2008 during the twelve months since december 31 2008 shareholders’ equity was reduced by the 47 million in share purchases but has been increased by a reduction of 819 million of net unrealized losses after tax in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved as explained in note 3—investments—unrealized loss analysis  unrealized losses in 2008 and early 2009 have resulted primarily from illiquidity in the financial markets in recent periods as a result of general economic conditions 

  

we plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future but we will be cautious in doing so excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases acquisitions increases in shareholder dividends investment in fixed maturities or repayment of shortterm debt we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies as mentioned previously our share repurchase program was suspended in the first quarter of 2009 due to general economic conditions at the time the program could be resumed with approval by the board of directors if share repurchases are determined to be the best use of excess cash 

  

historically management has felt that share purchases have been beneficial to the company we believe that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings and to return on equity and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value as noted earlier in this report we acquired over 2 million shares at a cost of 47 million in 2009 with excess cash flow in 2008 a much more significant purchase of 76 million shares at a cost of 427 million was made in 2008 if the free cash flow used for the repurchase of our common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds an estimated 11 million of additional investment income after tax would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have declined 9 to 499 because share purchases were made actual net income per share was 511 a lesser decline of 7 the majority of purchased shares are retired each year 

  

we maintain a significant availableforsale fixedmaturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets while invested assets are revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as assets with changes in value applied directly to shareholders’ equity due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our 

  

shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets more recently the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio has been depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity resulting in a significant decrease in shareholders’ equity because of the longterm nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity as such we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets accordingly our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  

selected financial data 

  

  

     

effective in 2008 the fasb issued new guidance offering an option which if elected would permit us to value our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets  however unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our availableforsale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results therefore we have not elected this option 

  

as discussed earlier in this report the fixed maturity portfolio incurred 18 billion in net unrealized investment losses in 2008 11 billion after tax and adjustments of deferred acquisition costs these unrealized losses are believed by management to have been brought on by widening credit spreads in financial markets and were the primary factor in the decline in our shareholders’ equity in 2008 in 2009 as conditions in financial markets have begun to improve unrealized losses have declined 13 billion 

  

9 billion after tax torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 97 times in 2009 compared with 115 times in 2008 and 128 times in 2007 a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 

  

credit ratings the credit quality of torchmark’s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies in 2008 moody’s affirmed our credit ratings in 2009 however they modified their outlook on our senior debt from stable to negative they cited their expectation of rising asset losses as well as tighter liquidity and reduced financial flexibility in 2008 standard  poor’s affirmed all credit ratings on torchmark and its subsidiaries however it revised its outlook to negative from stable for the company standard  poor’s cited our increased risk within our investment portfolio which had experienced significant unrealized losses concentrated in the financial sector they also noted that our share repurchase program has reduced our capitalization but that we were still well within a level adequate to support their rating during 2007 standard  poor’s lowered its credit rating on torchmark’s outstanding debt from a to a and lowered the rating of its preferred stock from a to bbb the credit rating change was attributed to weaker agent productivity recruiting and retention as well as changes in direct response strategy all of which have contributed to lower new sales during 2009 am best affirmed our funded debt rating at a but downgraded our preferred stock from bbb to bbb they also revised their outlook to negative on the funded debt also in 2009 fitch downgraded our senior debt from a to bbb two notches our preferred stock from a to bbb two notches and our commercial paper from f1 to f2 one notch fitch stated that the downgrades were a result of the weakness in the statutory capital position of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries brought on by the ratings downgrades of fixed maturity securities held in the subsidiaries’ investment portfolios they also expressed concern with the level of intercompany financing by the parent company from the subsidiaries the ongoing exposure to financial market turmoil and the expectation of continued investment deterioration going forward fitch had previously revised its outlook to negative from stable in 2008 and maintained the negative outlook in 2009 the chart below presents torchmark’s credit ratings as of december 31 2009 

  

   

in january 2010 fitch further downgraded our preferred stock one notch to bbb at that time fitch downgraded over 200 hybrid securities issued by insurance industry entities as their assessments of these securities in our industry changed 

  

the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries are also rated by standard  poor’s and am best in 2009 am best affirmed the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries in 2007 standard  poor’s lowered its financial strength rating of united investors to a from a and the ratings of liberty globe united american and american income from aa to aa as a result of an expected lag in new business sales in the short term the following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2009 

  

   

am best states that it assigns a superior ratings to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time the am best a excellent rating is assigned to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated excellent overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a excellent companies have an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 

  

the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard  poor’s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics differing only slightly from those rated higher the minus sign  shows the relative standing within the major rating category the a rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings

information regarding related party transactions is found in note 15—related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries such punitive damage claims that are tried in alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined additionally it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 14 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

new unadopted accounting rules 

  

the fasb has issued new accounting guidance potentially applicable to torchmark effective in future periods 

  

transfers of financial assets  this guidance effective for torchmark as of january 1 2010 amends previous guidance concerning transfers of financial assets to disallow the use of qualifying special purpose entities such entities are required to be evaluated for consolidation torchmark has no such entities and does not expect any impact from adoption 

  

variable interest entities this new guidance effective for torchmark as of january 1 2010 amends previous guidance concerning variable interest entities modifying the determination of the primary beneficiary and requiring ongoing assessment of primary beneficiary status of the variable interest entity for consolidation purposes at present the adoption of this guidance will have no effect on torchmark while the trust that holds torchmark’s 71 trust preferred securities is a variable interest entity and torchmark has 100 voting control torchmark is not the primary beneficiary therefore we will not consolidate the trust under the new guidance following the same treatment as in current practice 

  

fair value disclosures new guidance has been issued concerning disclosures about the fair value of financial assets this guidance will require us to separately disclose transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as we currently only disclose transfers in and out of level 3 the point at which the transfer is recognized must be disclosed all purchases sales issuances and settlements of level 3 assets must be reported on a gross basis contrary to our previous permitted practice of reporting on a net basis a more detailed disclosure of classes of investments will be required although torchmark currently complies with the required level of detail valuation techniques for level 2 and level 3 assets must be fully disclosed the new guidance will be effective for torchmark beginning january 1 2010 except for the detail breakout gross up of level 3 assets which is effective beginning january 1 2011 prior period comparisons are not required in the initial adoption periods early adoption is permitted 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note 5 — future policy benefit reserves  

  

approximately 72 of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2009 were traditional insurance liabilities whereby the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies a premium deficiency event for torchmark’s traditional business is very rare and did not occur during the three years ended december 31 2009 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business whereby the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 

  

deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales additionally the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption “value of insurance purchased” as indicated in note 4 — deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to consolidated financial statements our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

approximately 95 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2009 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december 31 2009 

  

the remaining portion of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised with the exception of variable annuities as discussed earlier in this report revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31 2009 the variable annuity block could sustain further increases in the level of amortization if equity markets were to decline amortization for deposit business is not expected to have a material impact on operations for the foreseeable future 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of 

  

policy types for which claim patterns are not well established and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

  

revenue recognition premium income from our subsidiaries’ insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is due however in accordance with gaap revenues on limitedpayment contracts and universal lifetype contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently revenues on limitedpayment contracts are recognized over the contract period premium for deposit balance products such as our annuity and interestsensitive life policies is added to the policy account value the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance administration surrender and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder in each case benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 

  

we report investment income as revenue less investment expenses when it is earned our investment activities are integral to our insurance operations because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates contract liabilities and other product contract features these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on our net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in our insurance and annuity products for more information concerning revenue recognition investment accounting and interest sensitivity please refer to note 1 — significant accounting policies and note 3 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities investments and market risk sensitivity in this report 

  

valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to maintain our investment quality and diversification standards we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixedmaturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

during recent periods the values of our fixed maturities have also been affected by illiquidity in the financial markets which has contributed to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixedmaturity investments is presented in note 3—investments under the caption fair value measurements  

  

impairment of investments we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value where fair value has declined below carrying value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies and note 3 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the 

  

captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2009 our net liability under these plans was 30 million 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected our discount rate rate of return on assets and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in note 9 — postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to us note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies and other related data

as of the end of the fiscal quarter completed december 31 2009 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of torchmark management including the chairman and chief executive officer and the executive vice president and chief financial officer of torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures as those terms are defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based upon their evaluation the chairman and chief executive officer and the executive vice president and chief financial officer have concluded that torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the date of this form 10k in compliance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 18 usc § 1350 each of these officers executed a certification included as an exhibit to this form 10k

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management at torchmark corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis as a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting the company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls accordingly even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time 

  

management evaluated the company’s internal control over financial reporting and based on its assessment determined that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2009 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and shareholders of 

torchmark corporation 

mckinney texas 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of torchmark corporation and subsidiaries “torchmark” as of december 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion torchmark maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2009 of torchmark and our report dated february 26 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

annuity products offered include singlepremium deferred annuities flexiblepremium deferred annuities and prior to 2008 variable annuities in recent years torchmark has deemphasized the marketing of annuity products annuities in each of the three years ending december 31 2008 comprised less than 1 of premium 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses all of which are generally based on company experience and on projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

  

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

  

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis a list of the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in the financial statements  see note 5 — future policy benefit reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

  

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities fixed maturities represented 93 of total investments at fair value at december 31 2008  see note 3 — investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis  

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

index to financial statements torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system at december 31 2008 torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in indiana missouri nebraska and new york 

  

insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions 

  

personnel 

  

at the end of 2008 torchmark had 2195 employees and 1410 licensed employees under sales contracts

 item 1a risk factors 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a mature regulated industry populated by many firms torchmark operates in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

  

the life insurance industry is highly competitive and could limit torchmark’s ability to gain or maintain market share competition by product price and for market share is generally strong in the life insurance industry but is less so in torchmark’s life insurance niche markets in recent years most life insurers have targeted the smaller highly competitive higherincome market by offering asset accumulation products torchmark’s market has remained the middle income market offering individuallysold protection life insurance which is less competitive because the market is larger with fewer competing insurers and with less price sensitivity than the higher income asset accumulation marketplace 

  

torchmark’s life insurance markets are subject to risks of general economic conditions   because torchmark serves the middle income market for individual protection life insurance competition is primarily from alternative uses of the customer’s disposable income in times of economic downturns that affect employment levels potential customers may be less likely to buy policies and policyholders may fail to pay premiums 

  

torchmark’s life products are sold in selected niche markets the company is at risk should any of these markets diminish torchmark has two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches labor union members and sales via direct response distribution the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales in recent years labor union membership has grown little and has declined as a percentage of employed workers however torchmark’s unionmember policyholders are still a small portion of total union membership indicating that sales growth can continue for some time without growth in total union membership most of the company’s direct response business is either through direct mail solicitation or inserted into other mail media for distribution significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business 

  

the development and maintenance of torchmark’s various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales because the company’s life insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market the development maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical for agents adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates them to increase sales is very important in direct response continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies will in time lead to less than optimum growth in sales and ultimately in profits 

  

health insurance marketplace risk 

  

congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact torchmark’s medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of torchmark’s in force health insurance business because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future these changes could have either a positive or negative effect on that business 

  

torchmark’s medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers the medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior  aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare such as health maintenance 

  

index to financial statements organizations hmos and other managed care or private plans the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance 

  

torchmark’s medicare supplement business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales in recent years price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market has been significant characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to under price new sales in order to gain market share torchmark believes these practices are not in the best interest of the company or consumers and has elected not to compete on those terms which has negatively affected sales should these industry practices continue it is likely that torchmark’s sales of this health product will remain depressed 

  

torchmark’s health business is at risk in the event of governmentsponsored underage65 health insurance currently torchmark’s leading health sales are from limited benefit products sold to people under age 65 these products are in demand when buyers are either self employed or their employers offer limited or no health insurance to employees if in the future the government offers comprehensive health care to people under age 65 demand for this product would likely decline however any government plan might provide beneficial opportunities if the plan includes the insurance industry as providers 

  

variable annuity marketplace risk 

  

our variable annuity business is at risk should equity markets decline revenues and underwriting income for variable annuities are based on policyholder account values which consist of investments primarily in equity markets when equity markets decline not only would revenues be expected to decline but we would generally expect redemptions to increase further negatively affecting revenues and underwriting income as a part of this business we also guarantee a minimum death benefit to policyholders to be paid regardless of account size upon death because of this benefit our obligation costs rise as the account balance declines additionally the decline in policyholder account size will require us to adjust our actuarial assumptions on this business to take into account the lower revenues as a result these revisions in assumptions will generally negatively impact our underwriting income variable annuities are not a significant part of our business and we no longer offer new variable annuity products 

  

general operating risk 

  

changes in mortality economic conditions or other market conditions could significantly affect our operation and profitability the company’s insurance contracts are affected by the levels of mortality morbidity persistency and healthcare utilization that we experience the resulting levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set significant variations in these levels could negatively affect profit margins and income however the company’s actuaries continually test expected to actual results 

  

ratings downgrades could negatively affect torchmark’s ability to compete ratings are a factor in torchmark’s competitive position rating organizations periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers including the company’s insurance subsidiaries while ratings are less important in the middleincome market than in markets focused on higher incomes or the group market downgrades in the ratings of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries could slightly affect the ability of the subsidiaries to market their products 

  

liquidity risk 

  

torchmark’s ability to pay dividends service any of its debt or preferred securities or meet its other operating commitments is limited by the amounts its subsidiaries are able to pay to the holding company torchmark’s insurance company subsidiaries its principal sources of cash flow periodically declare and distribute dividends on their common and preferred stock held by torchmark the holding company torchmark’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock principal and interest on any 

  

index to financial statements debt security or dividends on any preferred stock security is affected by the ability of its subsidiaries to pay the holding company these dividends the insurance company subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to the holding company for example under certain state insurance laws an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations excluding capital gains and losses or 10 of statutory surplus without regulatory approval 

  

torchmark can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to torchmark by its subsidiaries additionally the inability to obtain approval of the previously mentioned premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact the profitability and thus the ability of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries to declare and distribute dividends 

  

rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the considered factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to general economic conditions and circumstances outside of the company’s control 

  

investment risk 

  

the company’s investments are subject to market risks torchmark’s invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values factors that may affect these risks include interest rate levels financial market performance and general economic conditions as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of individual issuers some of these factors could result in significant writedowns of individual investments significant increases in interest rates or widening of credit spreads could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of the fixed investment portfolio reflecting unrealized fair value losses this risk is mitigated by torchmark’s operating strategy to generally hold investments to maturity recognizing the longterm nature of the life policy reserve liabilities supported by investments and by torchmark’s strong operating cash flow that greatly diminishes the need to liquidate investments prior to maturity a severe down turn in economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults and writedowns in our fixed maturity portfolio which could possibly restrict the capital structure of our insurance subsidiaries and limit their ability to pay dividends 

  

a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the rates credited to the net policy liabilities while torchmark attempts to manage its investments to preserve the excess investment income spread the company can give no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads 

  

significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in the company’s investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

  

regulatory risk 

  

regulatory changes could adversely affect our business insurance companies are subject to government regulation in each of the states in which they conduct business state agencies have broad administrative power over many aspects of the insurance business which may include premium rates marketing practices advertising licensing agents policy forms capital adequacy and permitted investments government regulators are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than our shareholders insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on its business furthermore the company cannot predict the timing or form of any future regulatory initiatives 

  

index to financial statements changes in taxation could negatively affect our income changes in the way the insurance industry is taxed or increases in tax rates could increase the company’s tax burden and negatively affect its income 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against the company or its subsidiaries a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark does business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states including alabama and mississippi juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit torchmark like other insurers is involved in this type of litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty 

  

natural disaster risk 

  

torchmark’s business is subject to risk of a catastrophic event the marketplaces of torchmark’s major subsidiaries are national in scope because the company’s insurance policies in force are relatively lowface amounts issued to large numbers of policyholders throughout the country the likelihood that a large portion of the company’s policyholder base would be affected by a natural disaster is not likely as a result it is unlikely that even a major natural disaster covering hundreds of miles would disrupt the marketing and premium collection in more than a small portion of torchmark’s markets in addition the administration of the four leading subsidiaries is conducted in three distant locations that allow the company to take advantage of those distances to plan backup administrative support for any one of the subsidiaries in the event of disaster the company also has outside contracts for offsite backup information systems and record keeping in the event of a disaster

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

torchmark and its subsidiaries in common with the insurance industry in general are subject to litigation including claims involving tax matters alleged breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmark’s subsidiaries employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on torchmark’s financial condition future operating results or liquidity however assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forwardlooking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges juries and appellate courts in the future this bespeaks caution particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as alabama and mississippi torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business particularly alabama and mississippi creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit 

  

as previously reported on march15 1999 torchmark was named as a defendant in consolidated derivative securities class action litigation involving vesta insurance group inc filed in the us district court for the northern district of alabama  in re vesta insurance group  inc securities litigation  master file no 98ar1407s the amended consolidated complaint in this litigation alleged violations of section 10 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 by the defendants vesta certain present and former vesta officers and directors kpmg llp vesta’s former independent public accountants and torchmark and of section 20 a of the exchange act by certain former vesta officers and directors and torchmark acting as “controlling persons” of vesta in connection with certain accounting irregularities in vesta’s reported financial results and filed financial statements unspecified damages and equitable relief were sought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of vesta equity securities between june 2 1995 and june 29 1998 a class was certified in this litigation on october 25 1999 in september 2001 torchmark filed a motion for summary judgment which was denied by the district court on january 10 2002 on april 9 2003 the 

  

index to financial statements district court issued an order denying the class plaintiffs’ motion to strike certain of torchmark’s affirmative defenses holding that torchmark could not be held jointly and severally liable with vesta under the securities law without an affirmative jury determination that torchmark knowingly committed a violation of the securities laws 

  

vesta its officers and directors its insurance carriers and kpmg settled their portions of the litigation with class plaintiffs in 2001 torchmark did not subsequently in may 2003 torchmark instituted separate litigation against kpmg which was resolved in march 2006 in april 2006 class plaintiffs in re vesta insurance group securities litigation filed a motion in us district court for the northern district of alabama renewing their claims against torchmark based upon an allegation of control person liability this matter was set for trial in the district court on october 2 2006 and was stayed pending resolution of an interlocutory appeal to the us circuit court of appeals for the eleventh circuit filed by class plaintiffs the interlocutory appeal which was filed august 23 2006 sought a ruling whether and to what extent proportionate liability provisions might apply if the allegations of controlling person liability against torchmark were ultimately proven arguments on the interlocutory appeal were heard by the eleventh circuit on july 31 2007 on april 30 2008 the eleventh circuit issued an opinion in the interlocutory appeal affirming the district court’s denial of class plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss torchmark’s affirmative defenses under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 pslra the eleventh circuit concluded that substantive controlling person liability under the federal securities law remained the same and survived the proportionate liability scheme established by pslra the court found that damages allocated against a controlling person found liable for a securities law violation were based upon the proportionate liability provisions in the pslra a trial date of september 8 2008 was set in the us district court for the northern district of alabama the parties reached a settlement of the vesta litigation on september 15 2008 on september 25 2008 the district court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement and directed the giving of notice thereof to the class members after a final settlement hearing the district court entered a final judgment and order of dismissal with prejudice approving the final settlement on december 12 2008 

  

as previously reported in forms 10k and 10q liberty and torchmark were parties to purported class action litigation filed in the circuit court of choctaw county alabama on behalf of all persons who currently or in the past were insured under liberty cancer policies which were no longer being marketed regardless of whether the policies remained in force or lapsed  roberts v liberty national life insurance company  case no cv2002009b these cases were based on allegations of breach of contract in the implementation of premium rate increases misrepresentation regarding the premium rate increases fraud and suppression concerning the closed block of business and unjust enrichment on december 30 2003 the alabama supreme court issued an opinion granting liberty’s and torchmark’s petition for a writ of mandamus concluding that the choctaw circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction and ordering that circuit court to dismiss the action the plaintiffs then filed essentially identical purported class action claims against liberty and torchmark in the circuit court of barbour county alabama on december 30 2003  roberts v liberty national life insurance company  civil action no cv030137 

  

on april 16 2004 the parties filed a written stipulation of agreement of compromise and settlement with the barbour county alabama circuit court seeking potential settlement of the roberts case a fairness hearing on the potential settlement was held by the barbour county circuit court with briefs received on certain issues materials relating to objections to the proposed settlement submitted to the courtappointed independent special master objectors to the potential settlement heard and a report of the courtappointed independent actuary received on certain issues thereafter 

  

on november 22 2004 the court entered an order and final judgment in roberts whereby the court consolidated roberts with robertson v liberty national life insurance company  cv92021 previously reported in forms 10k and 10q for purposes of the roberts stipulation of settlement and certified the roberts class as a new subclass of the class previously certified by that court in robertson  the court approved the stipulation and settlement and ordered and enjoined liberty to perform its obligations under the stipulation the court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims released the defendants enjoined roberts subclass members from any further prosecution of released claims and retained continuing jurisdiction of all matters relating to the roberts settlement in an order issued february 1 2005 the court denied the objectors’ motion to alter amend or vacate its earlier final judgment on class settlement and certification the companies proceeded to implement the settlement terms on march 10 2005 the roberts plaintiffs filed notice of appeal to the alabama supreme court 

  

index to financial statements in an opinion issued on september 29 2006 the alabama supreme court voided the barbour county circuit court’s final judgment and dismissed the roberts appeal the supreme court held that the barbour county court lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction in the separate roberts action to certify the roberts class and to enter a final judgment approving the settlement since roberts was filed as an independent class action collaterally attacking robertson rather than being filed in robertson itself under the barbour county court’s reserved continuing jurisdiction over that case on october 23 2006 liberty filed a petition with the barbour county circuit court under its continuing jurisdiction in robertson for clarification or in the alternative to amend the robertson final judgment liberty sought an order from the circuit court declaring that liberty pay benefits to robertson class members based upon the amounts accepted by providers in full payment of charges a hearing was held on liberty’s petition on march 13 2007 

  

on march 30 2007 the barbour county circuit court issued an order denying liberty’s petition for clarification andor modification of robertson  holding that liberty’s policies did not state that they will pay “actual charges” accepted by providers on april 8 2007 the court issued an order granting a motion to intervene and establishing a subclass in robertson comprised of liberty cancer policyholders who were then or had within the past six years undergone cancer treatment and filed benefit claims under the policies in question liberty filed a motion with the barbour county circuit court to certify for an interlocutory appeal that court’s order on liberty’s petition for clarification in robertson on april 17 2007 an appellate mediation of these issues was conducted on august 9 2007 on october 16 2007 the alabama supreme court entered orders based upon the conclusion by the parties of the appellate mediation staying the proceedings for a writ of mandamus reinstating the cases on the appellate docket and remanding the cases to the barbour county circuit court to implement the parties’ settlement agreement a fairness hearing on the proposed settlement agreement was held by the barbour county circuit court on january 15 2008 subsequent to this hearing an order approving the settlement agreement was approved by the barbour county circuit court but was thereafter vacated by that court due to technical errors in the printing of the original order a corrected order finally approving the settlement was entered on or about may 6 2008 prior to the entry of the corrected order notice of appeal was filed by one objector on july 29 2008 the alabama supreme court dismissed the remaining appeal in robertson  but reinstated that appeal on september 22 2008 appellate mediation was ordered with respect to this appeal and on september 30 2008 a settlement was reached in appellate mediation which resulted in a dismissal order in the objector’s litigation issued by the barbour county circuit court on october 16 2008 the alabama supreme court dismissed the remaining appeal on december 18 2008 the trial court’s may 6 2008 order finally approving the second class settlement in robertson is therefore in full force and effect

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and to a limited extent annuities to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the major insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully described in note 13 — business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and benefit administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is 

  

net investment income 

less 

interest credited to net policy liabilities 

financing costs 

  

the tables in note 13 — business segments reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ending december 31 2008 additionally this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates yeartoyear comparability and which reconciles to net income that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations net income declined 75 million or 14 to 452 million in 2008 on a diluted per share basis net income declined 7 to 511 the primary cause for the 2008 decline was aftertax realized investment losses of 70 million 108 million before tax these losses were due mostly to writedowns of fixedmaturity securities issued by lehman brothers and washington mutual in 2007 net income grew 2 or 9 million over the prior year to 528 million on a per share basis 2007 net income grew 7 to 550 per share earnings growth exceeded the growth in dollar earnings in both periods as a result of our share repurchase program discussed later under this caption life insurance was our strongest performing segment in both years contributing 15 million to 2008 pretax growth and 20 million to 2007 growth margin improvements in this segment were a result of premium growth and lower obligation ratios in both periods the investment segment also contributed to the growth in pretax income in each year rising 4 million in 2008 and 5 million in 2007 excess investment income measuring the profit of the investment segment was benefited by reduced financing costs and growth in the size of the investment portfolio in both years the growth in excess investment income was attained even though significant cash flow has been used to buy torchmark stock in all three periods 

  

in 2008 the contributions to growth in our life insurance and investment segments were more than offset by declines in our annuity and health segments our 2008 annuity underwriting loss was 6 million compared with gains of 9 million in 2007 and 12 million in 2006 in 2008 declines in equity markets have caused variable policyholder account values to decline guaranteed minimum death benefit costs to increase policyholders to withdraw funds and changes in actuarial assumptions all of which have resulted in the underwriting losses we do not emphasize this segment and have discontinued the sale of variable annuities in 2008 only offering a fixed annuity product health insurance underwriting margin improved 2 million to 208 million in 2007 but declined 7 or 14 million in 2008 to 195 million this 

  

index to financial statements segment has experienced increased competition in recent periods especially in 2008 which has caused a decline in agent count resulting in a significant reduction in new sales 

  

total revenues declined 5 in 2008 to 333 billion in 2007 total revenues rose 2 to 349 billion from 342 billion in 2006 life premium rose 47 million in 2008 and 46 million in 2007 while net investment income rose 23 million in 2008 and 20 million in 2007 growth in these two revenue components accounted for the increase in 2007 revenues however 2008 revenues were negatively affected by the aforementioned pretax realized loss of 108 million and a decline in health premium of 110 million described further under this caption 

  

life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december 31 2008 rising 3 in 2008 to 162 billion and also 3 in 2007 margins as a percentage of premium have also increased slightly each year to 27 of premium in 2008 and 2007 from 26 in 2006 life net sales rose 13 in 2008 to 298 million after having declined slightly in the two preceding years net sales rose in each of the three major life distribution channels in 2008 life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption life insurance 

  

we market three primary health insurance products underage65 limitedbenefit health insurance medicare supplement insurance and the medicare part d prescription drug benefit health premium declined 9 in 2008 to 11 billion from 12 billion in 2007 health premium was flat in 2007 with 2006 the primary factor in the 2008 decline was the decline in agent count in our united american branch office during the year our largest health producer this agency has experienced intense competition which has resulted in a significant decrease in new health sales and has negatively impacted premium income efforts are underway to rebuild this agency prior to 2008 this agency had been instrumental in the growth in the sales of our limitedbenefit health product as demand for this product had increased accordingly premium from the limitedbenefit product has grown significantly in relation to medicare supplement premium in recent years while medicare supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium increased competition has also dampened sales of this product resulting in premium declines in each successive year also 2008 was our third year of offering medicare part d insurance as most of the country’s part d enrollees selected a plan provider in 2006 we do not expect growth in our part d business going forward see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

  

while we still offer fixed annuities we do not emphasize sales of annuity products favoring life insurance instead see the caption annuities for further discussion of the annuity segment 

  

as previously mentioned the investment segment’s pretax profitability or excess investment income increased 4 million in 2008 and 5 million in 2007 it had declined 2 in the previous year this segment benefited from lower financing costs in each successive year in 2008 these costs declined primarily due to lower rates and a lower average balance on our shortterm debt in 2007 our interest expense on funded debt declined due to the refinancing of the two funded debt issues noted below prior to 2008 the average yield on new investments acquired had been lower than the average portfolio yield restricting growth in net investment income in relation to the size of the portfolio in 2008 however the yield on new investments exceeded the portfolio yield by 25 basis points growth in total investment income has been negatively affected by torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments management believes that the acquisition of torchmark stock at favorable prices provides a superior return on available cash 

  

torchmark’s current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investmentgrade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives approximately 93 of our invested assets at fair value consists of fixed maturities of which 94 was investment grade at december 31 2008 the average quality rating of the portfolio was bbb the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alta mortgages no residential mortgages no counterparty risks no credit default swaps or derivative contracts see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and n ote 3—investments in the notes to consolidated statements of operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment 

  

index to financial statements as mentioned earlier in this summary we wrote down certain fixed maturities and equities during 2008 including bonds issued by lehman brothers washington mutual and various other institutions in the pretax amount of 106 million the write downs were taken as these securities met our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment these writedowns compared with 11 million taken in 2007 and none in 2006 please refer to note 3—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption otherthantemporary impairments for more information on these writedowns and our criteria for consideration of otherthantemporary impairment including the writedowns we had total aftertax realized investment losses of 70 million in 2008 79 per share compared with a 2 million gain in 2007 02 per share and a 7 million loss in 2006 07 per share realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and may have a material positive or negative impact on net income under the caption realized gains and losses in this report we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses including the writedowns also as explained in note 13—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments 

  

during the second quarter of 2006 we issued two new debt securities in separate public offerings 1 our 71 trust preferred securities redemption amount 120 million and 2 our 6 3  8  senior notes par value 250 million these offerings essentially provided funding for the repayment of two existing debt instruments in the fourth quarter of 2006 1 the call of our 7¾ trust preferred securities at a redemption price of 150 million and 2 the maturity of our 6¼ senior notes par value 180 million more information on these transactions can be found in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 

  

in each of the years 2006 through 2008 net income was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring nonoperating items we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations a discussion of these items follows 

  

as reported in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption litigation and tax settlements  we have been involved in a number of litigation issues over the course of the three year period 2006 through 2008 in which we either received settlements net of expenses or incurred settlement losses and expenses these issues resulted in aftertax charges of 770 thousand in 2008 272 thousand in 2007 and an aftertax benefit of 74 million in 2006 additionally as described under the same caption of note 1 we received tax settlements in each year in the amounts of 108 million in 2008 11 million in 2007 and 116 million in 2006 all of these litigation and tax issues pertained to issues arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations legal expenses and litigation items pertaining to current operations are included in either insurance administrative expenses or parent expenses as appropriate in our segment analysis as explained in note 3—investments under the caption otherthantemporary impairments  we wrote down certain companyoccupied property to fair value during 2008 the write down resulted in an aftertax charge of 14 million 

  

in 2006 liberty began a program to dispose of its agency office buildings replacing them with rental facilities in 2006 21 buildings were sold for gross proceeds of 67 million and a pretax gain of 48 million in 2007 21 additional buildings were sold for proceeds of 64 million and a pretax gain of 43 million 28 million after tax the program began to wind down in 2008 as five buildings were sold for proceeds of 787 thousand and a pretax gain of 278 thousand 181 thousand after tax four buildings remained to be sold at december 31 2008 because of the significant scale of this nonoperating activity we have removed 43 million 28 million after tax from our core results representing the gain in 2006 and the gains on the sales in 2007 and 2008 

  

index to financial statements   

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 and was reaffirmed at its october 30 2008 board of director’s meeting with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december 31 2008

throughout the remainder of this discussion share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings 

  

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows 

  

life insurance life insurance is our largest insurance segment with 2008 life premium representing 59 of total premium life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 70 of the total in 2008 additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

life insurance premium rose 3 to 162 billion in 2008 after having increased 3 in 2007 to 157 billion life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows

premium by distribution method 

dollar amounts in thousands 

  

   

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any 

  

index to financial statements given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue net sales is annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

  

annualized life premium in force was 171 billion at december 31 2008 an increase of 2 over 167 billion a year earlier annualized life premium in force was 162 billion at december 31 2006

direct response is our leading writer of life insurance the direct response operation consists of two primary components direct mail and insert media direct mail targets primarily young middleincome households with children the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time at this time we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response’s premier markets 

  

index to financial statements insert media which targets primarily the adult market involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media such as coupon packets newspapers bank statements and billings this media was historically placed by direct marketing and advertising distributors inc dmad previously an unrelated entity with which we have had a business relationship for over fifteen years we acquired dmad in january 2007 for 47 million and integrated their operations during 2007 this acquisition allowed the company to expand marketing opportunities through increased solicitation volume and also improve margins through cost savings in the insert media component 

  

the direct response operation accounted for 32 of our life insurance premium during 2008 the largest of any distribution group direct response’s share of total life premium has risen steadily in each of the last three years as illustrated in the chart above life premium for this channel rose 6 in both 2008 and 2007 net sales rose 8 in 2008 to 123 million after a 1 decline in 2007 to 114 million firstyear collected premium increased 5 in 2008 to 80 million after a 2 decline in 2007 

  

the american income exclusive agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions but also on credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios life premium for this agency rose 8 to 474 million in 2008 after having also increased 8 in 2007 net sales increased 17 in 2008 to 108 million from 92 million in 2007 net sales rose 7 in 2007 firstyear collected premium rose 11 in 2008 to 82 million after having increased 2 in 2007 as in the case of all of torchmark’s agency distribution systems continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count growth in the agent count has contributed to the improvements in sales in this agency the american income agent count was 3085 at december 31 2008 compared with 2545 a year earlier an increase of 21 the agent count rose 8 in 2007 from 2353 at year end 2006 this agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business additionally the systematic centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets its life products to primarily middleincome customers in southeastern states liberty’s life premium declined 2 in both 2008 and 2007 compared with the respective prior year liberty’s life premium sales in terms of net sales were 49 million in 2008 representing an increase of 31 in 2008 net sales had declined 11 in 2007 firstyear collected premium increased 3 in 2008 to 30 million after having declined 16 in 2007 

  

growth in the liberty agency’s sales and premium volume are highly dependent on building the size of its agency force liberty has implemented initiatives similar to those of american income to recruit new agents primarily through the use of the internet the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems liberty’s agent count rose 43 to 3437 at december 31 2008 from 2410 a year earlier this compared with an increase of 39 in 2007 but a decline of 20 in 2006 most of the growth in the 2007 agent count occurred in the latter half of the year as new agents become trained and more seasoned they are expected to become more productive the growth in 2008 net sales is attributable to the growth in the agent counts in 2008 and the latter part of 2007 while the 2007 decline in net sales was a result of the decline in agent counts in 2006 and early 2007 in 2006 the liberty national agency began the reorganization of its marketing leadership and restructured its agent compensation system to provide greater reward to productive agents and to establish production minimums for agents these changes led to terminations and resignations during 2006 of agents not meeting these production minimums however management believes that these changes will result in a more productive agency over the long term management also believes these changes are responsible for recent margin improvements a larger and more productive agency force should lead to increased sales which in turn should result in increased premium growth 

  

we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the united investors agency the military agency the united american independent and branch office agencies and other small miscellaneous sales agencies the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business united investors represented 4 of torchmark’s 2008 life premium income the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and 

  

index to financial statements noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of wholelife products with term insurance riders military premium represented 12 of life premium the united american independent and branch office agencies combined represented approximately 3 of torchmark’s total life premium in the past these agencies focused on health insurance with life sales being incidental

gross margins as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense rose 4 in 2008 to 432 million after rising 5 in 2007 as a percentage of life insurance premium gross margins have increased slightly each year and were 27 in 2008 improvements in life margins have resulted from several factors margin improvements in both 2008 and 2007 were primarily the result of premium growth but favorable mortality was also a positive factor this improvement in mortality is not expected to be a trend an important factor in the 2008 increase was that american income’s obligation ratios decreased from 34 to 32 additionally the proportion of american income premium to total premium has grown each year and that has caused life margins to increase because that agency’s margins are torchmark’s highest well exceeding 30 in all periods 

  

index to financial statements health insurance health products sold by torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical plans cancer and accident plans sold to people under age 65 we also sell medicare supplements to enrollees in the federal medicare program as well as providing coverage under the medicare part d prescription drug program beginning january 1 2006 health premium represented 41 of torchmark’s total premium income in 2008 excluding part d premium health premium represented 37 in 2008 compared with 39 in 2007 and 40 in 2006 health underwriting margin excluding part d accounted for 29 of the total in 2008 compared with 30 in 2007 and 31 in 2006 these declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment health results have also been negatively affected by increased competition in recent periods the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years

we market supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels with the two united american agencies being our market leaders over the past several years we have placed greater emphasis on the sale of limitedbenefit health insurance products to underage65 consumers rather than medicare supplement insurance as customer demand for the limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical 

  

index to financial statements plans has increased and price competition and lesser demand for medicare supplements has dampened the sales of that product while medicare supplement still remains our largest health product in terms of premium income the proportion of premium from other limitedbenefit health products has grown steadily over the past few years as shown in the chart above medicare supplement premium represented 51 of total health premium excluding part d in 2008

the united american branch office and independent agencies as discussed above the two united american ua agencies have emphasized sales of individual supplemental limitedbenefit health plans known generally as hospitalsurgical plans marketed to underage65 customers for which demand has increased in recent years these plans generally provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined a fixedamount surgical schedule out patient coverage and other miscellaneous hospitalrelated charges they also contain caps on total perillness benefits consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual majormedical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limitedbenefit plans are generally lower than those of medicare supplement however the medicare supplement product has historically had slightly higher persistency rates resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium both of the ua agencies offer these limitedbenefit plans 

  

index to financial statements the ua branch office is an exclusive agency meaning the agents in its 85 offices nationwide sell only for us in recent years this agency has focused its efforts on sales of limitedbenefit products and has been successful in building the sales of these plans replacing the decline in medicare supplement sales 

  

in 2008 the ua branch office represented 51 of torchmark’s nonmedicare part d sales beginning in late 2007 and throughout 2008 this agency has experienced increased agent turnover and a decline in agent count due to increased competition in the sales of health products as a result sales and premium at the ua branch office declined in 2008 as is the case with all of our captive agencies growing the agency size translates into increased sales and premium growth after growing very rapidly in periods prior to mid2007 the producing agent count in the ua branch office has declined since that time at year end 2008 the producing agent count was 1583 compared with 2979 at the end of 2007 and 3015 at december 31 2006 these declines in agent count have resulted in the declines in net sales and premium growth shown in the charts above especially in 2008 efforts are underway to rebuild this agency going forward we are shifting the emphasis in the ua branch office agency to life and health products currently marketed by liberty national agents these products are priced to achieve higher profit margins and have better persistency than ua’s limitedbenefit health insurance we will continue to offer the current product portfolio but the majority of our financial incentives will be used to encourage agents to sell the liberty national product line we believe this will improve the stability and profitability of the ua branch office agency 

  

the ua independent agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large multistate organizations down to oneperson offices all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies of which 2838 were active producing agents for torchmark at december 31 2008 this agency is our largest carrier of medicare supplement insurance with 278 million or 57 of our medicare supplement premium income in 2008 overall this agency’s contribution to torchmark’s total health sales and premium has declined in each of the past three years as a result of the increased competition in medicare supplement sales health premium for the ua independent agency declined 8 to 357 million in 2008 after declining 7 in 2007 the declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency  predominantly a life insurance distribution channel is the third largest writer of torchmark health business based on premium collected cancer supplemental plans are the type of limitedbenefit health products primarily produced by this agency liberty is our only distribution channel for which cancer insurance is its primary health product liberty’s health premium declined 4 in 2008 to 135 million after a 3 drop in 2007 several factors have contributed to the decline in health premium in this agency most notable has been the increased emphasis on sales of the highermargin life products at liberty another factor prior to 2008 was the decline in agent count discussed earlier under the caption life insurance as a result of the change in the agent compensation system in 2006 to improve persistency and margins however recruiting and training initiatives have resulted in a significant increase in the liberty agent count in 2008 additionally there was a settlement of a classaction lawsuit in early 2005 concerning a closed block of cancer business over the timing and size of the premium rate increases on this block this block represented approximately half of liberty’s cancer business at that time and approximately 37 at year end 2008 prior to the settlement significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on this block resulted in higher health premium but increasing claims continued to reduce underwriting margins the settlement provided for reduced benefits paid going forward and further required liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an 85 claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business net health sales in the liberty agency rose 22 to 12 million compared with 2007 net health sales of 10 million net health sales had declined 16 from 2006 sales of 12 million 

  

american income exclusive agency also predominantly a life insurance distribution channel is our fourth largest health insurance distributor based on 2008 premium collected its health plans are comprised of various limitedbenefit plans for which approximately 69 of the agency’s 2008 health premium was from accident policies sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 

  

health premium at this agency rose 4 in 2008 to 73 million after having increased 5 to 71 million in 2007 net health sales were 118 million in 2008 compared with 113 million in 2007 and 117 million in 2006 net health sales comprised less than 10 of the american income agency’s total net sales in 2008 

  

index to financial statements direct response  primarily a life operation also offers health insurance which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups in 2008 net health sales were 6 million comprising less than 5 of direct response’s total life and health net sales direct response health net sales and premium income have risen each year over the prior year net sales increased 7 in 2008 and 2 in 2007 health premium rose 7 in both 2008 and 2007 increasing to 45 million in 2008 

  

medicare part d torchmark through its subsidiary united american began offering insurance coverage under the government’s medicare part d plan as of january 1 2006 the medicare part d plan is a standalone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american unlike the traditional medicare program for hospital and doctor services where cms is the primary insurer and private medicare supplement insurers are secondary insurers the program generally calls for cms to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium total medicare part d premium was 176 million in 2008 compared with 215 million in 2007 and 212 million in 2006 the decline in part d premium resulted from the decline in the number of enrollees enrollment for all part d coverages ends on december 31 of the previous year except for enrollees who reach age 65 in the current year at december 2007 united american had approximately 158 thousand enrollees for the 2008 part d plan compared with 189 thousand for the 2007 plan year although final enrollment has not been confirmed we do not expect a significant increase in enrollees for the 2009 plan year our medicare part d product is sold primarily through the direct response operation but is also sold by the two ua agencies part d net sales were 28 million in 2008 and 25 million in 2007 compared with 278 million in 2006 we count only sales to new firsttime enrollees in net sales and 2006 was the first year the medicare part d program was in effect the majority of 2008 and 2007 premium income was from previous enrollees 

  

we believe that the medicare part d program is an excellent addition to our health product offerings because of our experience with the seniorage market and with medicare supplements the government assurances with regard to the risksharing agreements for participating insurers the incremental income added to our health insurance margins and the renewal of the business every year due to our experience with service to the seniorage market and the use of our existing direct response marketing system entry to this business required little new investment however we do not expect growth in the part d product in the near future as most medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a plan in 2006 additionally as with any governmentsponsored program the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market

index to financial statements torchmark’s health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense declined 7 in 2008 to 195 million but has improved as a percentage of premium in each of the periods presented health margin rose 1 to 208 million in 2007 these increases were primarily the result of the reduced loss ratios in the previouslymentioned closed block of cancer business at liberty and improvements in american income’s loss ratios in each successive year liberty’s health margins increased 2 million or 5 in 2008 and 6 million or 20 in 2007 as a percentage of premium liberty’s health margin was 26 in 2008 compared with 24 in 2007 and 20 in 2006 american income’s margins rose 2 million in both 2008 and 2007 they were 37 of premium in 2008 and 36 of 2007 premium 

  

annuities fixed annuity products are sold on a limited basis by our subsidiaries variable annuities were sold prior to 2008 but new sales were discontinued during the year annuities represented less than 1 of torchmark’s 2008 premium revenue we do not emphasize this segment and annuities continue to diminish in relation to our other operations

declines in equity markets during 2008 have had a significant effect on the variable policyholder account balance as they have resulted in declines in value in the underlying investments and increased policyholder withdrawals the decline in the size of the annuity account balance has had a negative impact on annuity underwriting income an analysis of underwriting income is as follows

index to financial statements annuities generate earnings from periodic policy fees and charges to the account balances reduced by net policy obligations and acquisition costs policy charges and underwriting margins have declined in each of the periods presented primarily due to the declines in our variable annuity business because policy charge revenues for variable annuities are based on the size of the policyholder’s account value policy charges have declined each period as declining equity markets voluntary terminations and lower sales have resulted in decreases in the variable account balance especially in 2008 in addition to the revenue declines underwriting income for the variable product has been negatively affected by two other factors first we have guaranteed minimum death benefits to variable policyholders providing that a certain minimum death benefit will be payable to them regardless of the policyholders’ account value upon death for this reason we provide a reserve for this benefit for which the cost increases as the policyholder’s account value declines this reserve is subject to the periodic review of underlying assumptions and a revision or “unlocking” when experience so indicates in 2008 the additional charge to policy obligation expense from unlocking was 61 million compared with reduced expense of 14 million in 2007 and 11 million in 2006 the other factor is that the deferred acquisition cost asset with regard to variable annuities is also subject to the unlocking of assumptions because of the variable account balance decline future revenues and profits on variable business would also be expected to decline this unlocking of assumptions resulted in a net charge of 75 million in 2008 compared with charges of 23 million in 2007 and 9 million in 2006 without these unlocking adjustments variable underwriting income would have been 57 million in 2008 42 of revenue compared with 87 million 45 of revenue in 2007 and 99 million 46 of revenue in 2006 the unamortized deferred acquisition cost balance was 42 million at december 31 2008 compared with 53 million at year end 2007 if equity markets do not stabilize we could see higher amortization of acquisition costs in the future the variable annuity business is our only business where margins are significantly impacted by changes in equity markets 

  

while the fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year policy charges have remained steady and underwriting income has declined slightly each year the stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist of surrender charges and are not based on account size these charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods a significant portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements which can result in negative net policy obligations however this investment income spread has declined in each year resulting in the decline in underwriting income

insurance administrative expenses rose 3 in 2008 after a slight decline in 2007 as a percentage of premium they rose to 58 in 2008 after having decreased from 56 in 2006 to 55 in 2007 the 2008 increase was primarily a result of higher salary expenses pension costs and other costs such as postage and property taxes the 2008 increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses and medicare part d administrative expense one factor in the higher 2007 legal expense was the affirmation of an earlier jury verdict in insurance claim litigation in the amount of 19 million medicare part d administrative expenses were lower in both 2008 and 2007 than in 2006 because open enrollment remained in effect in 2006 until may 15 causing us to incur additional administrative expenses in that year open enrollments for the 2007 and 2008 plan years were closed on december 31 of the respective prior year salaries particularly in 2007 were favorably impacted by the previouslymentioned changes to liberty national’s agent compensation system while these changes resulted in reductions in agent salaries and related employee costs of approximately 28 million in 2007 compared with 2006 new initiatives have resulted in an increase in these costs in 2008 of approximately 16 million over 2007 management believes that these salary reductions could be replaced by higher deferred acquisition costs going forward however as the compensation system changes emphasize a commissionbased agent compensation system rather than salaries commissions on new product sales are deferred and amortized over the premiumpaying life of the business management believes that pension cost will increase approximately 8 million in 2009 as a result of the impact that declining financial markets have had on pension funding 

  

parent company expense rose 640 thousand or 7 in 2008 and 20 million or 25 in 2007 included in 2008 and 2007 expenses were charges in the amount of 29 million in 2008 and 16 million in 2007 for expenses incurred related to potential acquisition bids that were not successful 

  

index to financial statements as mentioned in note 1— significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we settled litigation in prior periods relating to issues occurring many years ago but incurred 25 million in legal costs in 2008 and 933 thousand in 2007 as previously noted we do not consider the costs of settling litigation applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations stock compensation expense rose in 2008 because 2008 was the first year after adoption of the accounting rule requiring the expensing of stock options where we had three years of annual employee grants being expensed 2005 2006 and 2008 the 2004 employee grant was fully vested in 2005 before adoption and there was no grant in 2007 new restricted stock grants in each of the three years 2006 through 2008 which generally vest over five years have also contributed to the increases in 2008 and 2007 stock compensation expense management believes that it is highly unlikely that stock compensation expense will increase materially in 2009 or over the near term as stated in note 13—business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense and therefore treats it as a parent company expense as described in note 3—investments under the caption otherthantemporary impairments  we wrote down certain companyoccupied real estate because it met our criteria as described in that note for otherthantemporary impairment as a result we incurred a pretax charge of 21 million which is included in operating expenses in the 2008 consolidated statement of operations  

  

investments we manage our capital resources including investments debt and cash flow through the investment segment excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 1 3— business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used 40 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  

   

index to financial statements  

   

  

excess investment income increased 4 million or 1 in 2008 over the prior year excess investment income increased 5 million or 2 in 2007 on a per diluted share basis 2008 excess investment income rose 10 to 371 per share excess investment income increased 7 in 2007 and 3 in 2006 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income which rose 35 to 671 million in 2008 it increased 32 to 649 million in 2007 from 628 million in 2006 as presented in the following chart the growth in net investment income in both periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets 

  

   

the lower growth in income is reflective of new investments that have been made in recent years at longterm yields lower than the portfolio’s average yield resulting from the lower rates available in financial markets in those periods however as noted under the caption investment acquisitions below we did acquire 11 billion in fixed maturities in 2008 yielding 25 basis points higher than the average portfolio yield for the first time in several years in each year 2006 through 2008 new acquisitions were made at lower yields than the yields on securities disposed of contributing to the lower growth in income relative to the portfolio growth another factor limiting the growth in net investment income relative to average assets in 2007 was the purchase of 256 million of taxexempt municipal securities yields available on municipal bonds are lower but produce significant tax savings to the company also contributing to the lower growth in yields in recent years were calls on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio as the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities given the sizeable annual cash flow from our operations we expect mean invested assets to continue to grow but if rates available for new investments do not exceed our portfolio yield the rate of growth of investment income will lag the growth in assets more detailed information about investment acquisitions follows under the caption investment acquisitions  

  

excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 

  

interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities

index to financial statements the average interest crediting rate has risen in each of the last three years in 2001 as part of our normal review of policy reserve assumptions we increased the interest rate assumption 100 basis points 1 on policies issued after january 1 2001 as this group of policies becomes a larger proportion of our business the average crediting rate will continue to increase for more specific information on life and health crediting rates please refer to note 5—future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs

the table below presents the components of financing costs 

  

analysis of financing costs 

amounts in thousands 

  

   

financing costs declined 4 million or 6 in 2008 they declined 5 million or 7 in 2007 the 2008 decline resulted from a decrease in shortterm interest rates during 2008 as well as a 4 decline in our average commercial paper balance for the year to 229 million the primary factor in the 2007 decrease was the refinancing in 2006 of two of our funded debt issues our 6¼ senior notes 180 million principal amount matured and our 7¾ trust preferred securities 150 million redemption value were called in the fourth quarter of 2006 these repayments were essentially funded by the issuance of two new instruments in the second quarter of 2006 our 6 3  8  senior notes 250 million principal amount and our 71 trust preferred securities 120 million principal amount because the new issues were offered several months before the other securities were repaid interest on funded debt increased 11 million it should be noted however that we invested the proceeds of the new offerings and the investment income from those proceeds offset the increased financing costs having little impact on excess investment income partially offsetting the decline in interest on funded debt in 2007 was an increase in interest on shortterm debt while higher shortterm rates were a factor the primary cause of the increase was a higher average balance of our commercial paper outstanding in 2007 which rose 43 to 238 million 

  

index to financial statements prior to 2006 we entered into several interestrate swap agreements in which we exchanged our fixedinterest commitments for floatingrate commitments in the lowinterest environment experienced in the past several years these swaps provided us with a considerable spread between our actual interest cost and what our fixed interest cost would have been however as rates began to rise in 2005 and 2006 we began to dispose of these instruments in 2005 and had disposed of all remaining swap instruments as of the second quarter of 2006 the benefit of the swaps in 2006 reduced our financing costs in that year by 491 thousand more information concerning the debt offerings repayments and swaps is disclosed in note 1 0— debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

excess investment income benefits from increases in longterm rates available on new investments and decreases in shortterm borrowing rates of these two factors higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at shortterm rates 

  

investment acquisitions  torchmark’s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investmentgrade fixed maturities with long maturities maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date that meet our quality and yield objectives we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities we believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable if such longerterm securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives new money is invested shortterm with maturities less than five years during calendar years 2006 through 2008 torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities primarily corporate securities there were no below investment grade securities acquired investmentgrade corporate securities include both bonds and trustpreferred securities which are classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors 

  

index to financial statements the following table summarizes selected information for fixedmaturity purchases the effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield this date is commonly known as the “worst call date” for noncallable bonds the worst call date is always the maturity date for callable bonds the worst call date is the call date that produces the lowest yield or the maturity date if the yield calculated to the maturity date is lower than the yield calculated to each call date two different average life calculations are shown average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date

we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether or not and if so when the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable bonds the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment we do know that the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 

  

prior to 2007 we generally did not invest in securities with maturity dates more than 30 years after the acquisition date because of the changing investment environment during 2007 and 2008 we invested some funds in fixedmaturity securities bonds trust preferred securities and redeemable preferred stocks with longer scheduled maturity dates in virtually all cases such securities have a scheduled maturity date and are callable many years prior to the scheduled maturity date due primarily to this increase in these longerterm securities the average life of funds invested during 2007 and 2008 to both next call and maturity is significantly higher than that of investments during 2006 

  

new cash flow available to us for investment has been affected by issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past three years issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost calls increase funds available for investment but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called issuer calls were 238 million in 2008 848 million in 2007 and 229 million in 2006 the 2007 level of calls was unusual and contributed to the significant increase in funds invested in that year 

  

index to financial statements portfolio analysis because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms the following table presents a comparison of torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2008 with the latest industry data 

  

   

at december 31 2008 approximately 94 of our investments at book value were in a diversified fixedmaturity portfolio policy loans which are secured by policy cash values made up an additional 4 the remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities mortgage loans and other longterm and shortterm investments 

  

because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities at december 31 2008 fixed maturities had a fair value of 78 billion compared with 92 billion at december 31 2007 net unrealized losses on fixed maturities increased from 103 million at december 31 2007 to 18 billion at december 31 2008 more than 1 billion of the increase in net unrealized loss during 2008 was attributable to securities for which there was no downgrade in the bloomberg composite rating approximately 300 million of the increase was attributable to securities for which there was a onestep downgrade in the bloomberg composite rating more than 800 million of the increase was attributable to securities issued by banks and insurance companies as discussed in note 3—investments under the caption fair value measurements  we believe based on what we have observed in the market that much of the increase in unrealized losses was attributable to illiquidity in the markets this illiquidity has contributed to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable torchmark has the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery an analysis of our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2008 is as follows

index to financial statements   

approximately 80 of our fixed maturity assets at december 31 2008 were corporate bonds and 13 were redeemable preferred stocks less than 1 of the assets were residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities and collateralized debt obligations cdos all of the mortgagebacked securities were rated aaa the average rating of our cdos was a with none rated less than bbb unless otherwise indicated our security ratings are based on the bloomberg composite rating a blend of ratings of securities from four prominent rating agencies 

  

at the end of 2008 and 2007 the fixedmaturity portfolio had a gross unrealized gain of 126 million and 247 million respectively gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities were 19 billion at december 31 2008 compared with 350 million a year earlier for further analysis of our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2008 and 2007 an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities see note 3—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

additional information concerning the fixedmaturity portfolio is as follows 

  

fixed maturity portfolio selected information 

  

   

the decline in effective duration during 2008 was a result of significantly higher discount rates implied by the decline in the market value of the portfolio reducing sensitivity to changes in rates 

  

index to financial statements credit risk sensitivity credit risk is the level of certainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity approximately 94 of our fixedmaturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities including redeemable preferred and assetbacked securities as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities credit risk is a concern we mitigate this ongoing risk in part by acquiring investmentgrade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis we also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors 

  

the following table presents the relative percentage of our corporate fixed maturities by industry sector at december 31 2008 

  

   

at december 31 2008 approximately 37 of the fixed maturity assets at fair value were in the financial sector including 16 in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 17 in banks financial guarantors and mortgage insurers comprised approximately 1 of the portfolio after financials the next largest sector was utilities which comprised 13 of the portfolio the balance of the portfolio is spread among 246 issuers in a wide variety of sectors 

  

gross unrealized losses were 19 billion as previously noted based upon what we have observed in the market management believes that much of the unrealized loss at december 31 2008 was attributable to illiquidity in the market contributing to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable torchmark has the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery approximately 54 of the gross unrealized losses were attributable to the financial sector including 27 attributable to life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 17 attributable to banks we are encouraged by the efforts of the federal government to help banks and insurance companies to weather the current financial crisis but the company cannot predict at this time what impact these efforts will have on ultimate recovery

the portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of bbb based on amortized cost approximately 93 of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by subprime or alta mortgages loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower we have no direct investments in residential mortgages nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts we do not participate in securities lending there are no offbalance sheet investments as all investments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets  at december 31 2008 we had 14 million at fair value 131 million book value invested in cdos for which the bloomberg composite rating at that date was a the collateral underlying these cdos is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies but no subprime or alta mortgages are included in the collateral 

  

our current investment policy is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

subsequent data as of february 12 2009 the gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity assets at february 12 2009 was 20 billion an increase of 95 million or 5 since december 31 2008 the decline in fair value of fixed maturities in the financial  bank sector accounted for 109 million of the increase in gross unrealized loss 

  

index to financial statements market risk sensitivity torchmark’s financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since 94 of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixedmaturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixedrate investments the portfolio is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value under normal market conditions we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however in accordance with gaap these liabilities are not marked to market 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2008 and 2007 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points 

  

   

realized gains and losses our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits we also incur acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

because our investment portfolio is large and diverse investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses occur only incidentally usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the periodtoperiod trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results 

  

index to financial statements the following table summarizes our taxeffected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2008

as described in note 3— investments under the caption otherthan temporary impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we wrote certain securities down to fair value during 2008 as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in note 3 and in our critical accounting policies in this report the writedown resulted in a 2008 pretax charge of 106 million 69 million after tax of this pretax amount 94 million consisted of bonds of lehman brothers and washington mutual and perpetual preferred stock of federal national mortgage association as shown in the table below 

  

   

due to the current status of these entities we expect our future net investment income to be reduced by approximately 7 million per year additionally in 2008 securities of certain nonfinancial institutions were determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired and were written down 12 million 8 million after tax we also wrote down a real estate investment to fair value in 2008 resulting in a loss of 11 million 718 thousand after tax 

  

in 2007 we wrote down certain nonfinancial institution holdings because of otherthantemporary impairment the pretax charge for this impairment was 11 million 7 million after tax at the time of impairment these securities were carried at a value of 48 million since the writedown a portion of these securities were sold for proceeds of 19 million in 2007 and the remainder was sold in 2008 for proceeds of 15 million 

  

index to financial statements as discussed in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we redeemed our 7¾ trust preferred securities in 2006 recording a pretax loss of 55 million 36 million after tax additionally in 2006 we repurchased with the intent to retire 33 million principal amount of our 7 7  8  notes recording a pretax loss of 415 thousand 270 thousand after tax 

  

in years prior to 2007 we entered into interestrate swap agreements swapping our fixedrate commitments on our longterm debt for floatingrate commitments accounting rules required us to value our interestrate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period and we recorded changes as a component of “realized investment gains losses” during the first half of 2006 we sold all remaining swap instruments so that no swaps were held after june 2006 more information on our swaps including the accounting policies is found in note 1—significant accounting policies and in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes 

  

cash inflows from insurance operations significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers such as torchmark expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods sometimes many years later an actuarially computed reserve is carried in the financial statements for these future benefits earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period but there is no corresponding cash outlay therefore cash provided from operations is generally expected to exceed net income cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of the investment portfolio cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements available cash flows are also used to repay debt to buy back torchmark shares to pay shareholder dividends and for other corporate uses as discussed below under the caption parent company liquidity  the primary source of the cash flows for these purposes is dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries to the parent company 

  

cash flows provided from operations were 731 million in 2008 850 million in 2007 and 865 million in 2006 in addition we received 581 million in investment maturities repayments and calls in 2008 adding to available cash flows such repayments were 13 billion in 2007 and 606 million in 2006 

  

our cash and shortterm investments were 177 million at yearend 2008 and 131 million at yearend 2007 additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 78 billion at december 31 2008 however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

parent company liquidity an important source of cash flow to the parent company is dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries as allowed by insurance regulations the insurance subsidiaries generally pay dividends to torchmark parent in amounts equal to their prior year earnings calculated on a statutory basis these dividends are received in order to meet the parent company’s dividend payments on common and preferred stock interest and principal repayment requirements on debt of the parent company and operating expenses of the parent in 2008 404 million in dividends were paid to the parent company as compared with 458 million in 2007 and 428 million in 2006 after paying debt obligations shareholder dividends and other expenses but before share repurchases torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in 2008 of approximately 343 million parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases in 2009 it is expected that the parent company will receive 348 million in dividends from subsidiaries and that a range of 320 million to 330 million will be available as excess cash flow assuming that our senior debt due in august 2009 is refinanced certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 11 — shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations 

  

torchmark qualifies for and is participating in the commercial paper funding facility cpff a facility created by the federal reserve board to purchase commercial paper from eligible issuers torchmark can issue 305 million under the cpff which was the par amount outstanding at december 31 2008 book value 304 million 

  

capital in our insurance subsidiaries is sufficient to support current operations as of december 31 2008 the ratio of regulatory capital to company action level required capital was 329 in line with recent years 

  

index to financial statements an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 600 million as of december 31 2008 we had available 95 million on this facility for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility see the commercial paper section of note 10 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as fully described and discussed in note 10 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt torchmark had outstanding 120 million par amount 71 trust preferred securities at both december 31 2008 and 2007 the capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders the trust is an offbalance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules deconsolidation is required because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest therefore torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity even though we own all of the entity’s voting equity and have guaranteed the entity’s performance while these liabilities are not on our consolidated balance sheets  they are represented by torchmark’s 71 junior subordinated debentures due to the trust these junior subordinated debentures were a torchmark liability of 124 million par and book value at both december 31 2008 and 2007 these securities are indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption capital resources in this report the 71 preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our 71 interest payment on our debt to the trusts as described in note 14 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 

  

as of december 31 2008 we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of thirdparty entities other than as described above all of our guarantees other than the trust preferred guarantee were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 14 — commitments and contingencies 

  

the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december 31 2008 

  

amounts in millions 

  

  

       

index to financial statements capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in note 10 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements longterm funded debt junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities and shareholders’ equity the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark’s capital trust iii which is liable for its trust preferred securities in accordance with gaap these instruments are included in “due to affiliates” on the consolidated balance sheets a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

the carrying value of the funded debt was  722 million at december 31 2008 the same as a year earlier our 825 senior debentures are due in august 2009 at a redemption amount of 995 million plus accrued interest and are classified as shortterm debt because they are due within a year as a result reported longterm debt at december 31 2008 was 499 million if conditions in financial markets stabilize we intend to refinance this debt with another issue otherwise we intend to repay the debt with our excess cash flow 

  

during the second quarter of 2006 we registered and issued two new security offerings our 71 trust preferred securities offered through torchmark capital trust iii at a redemption value of 120 million less issue expenses and our 6 3  8  senior notes issued for the principal amount of 250 million less issue expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006 we redeemed our 7 3  4  trust preferred securities and we repaid our 6 1  4  senior notes which matured the trust preferred securities were redeemed for 150 million plus accrued dividends and our senior notes were repaid in the principal amount of 180 million plus accrued interest specific information about the new securities offered and the securities repaid in 2006 including the uses of proceeds and sources of funding is disclosed and discussed in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

over the past several years we have entered into swap agreements to exchange the fixedrate commitments on our funded debt for floatingrate commitments during the low interestrate environment in recent years these swaps were very beneficial in reducing our interest cost however as shortterm rates rose in 2006 with no meaningful change in longterm rates these swaps became less profitable because we believed that the swap settlements could have possibly become unprofitable we disposed of our two remaining swap agreements during 2006 and held no swap agreements after june 2006 more information about our swaps is found in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption interest rate swaps  

  

we believe that the most beneficial use of our excess cash flow could be a strategic acquisition however an acquisition is unlikely until financial markets stabilize absent an acquisition we believe that the best use of excess cash is to buy company stock however we will exercise caution given current economic conditions we will not jeopardize our liquidity or debt covenants through our share repurchase program as previously mentioned our board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the stock repurchase program in october 2008 in amounts and timing that management in consultation with the board determined to be in the best interest of the company we have repurchased common stock every year since 1986 except for 1995 the year following the acquisition of american income since the beginning of 1998 we have repurchased 60 million shares at a total cost of 27 billion and have acquired no fewer than 34 million shares in any one year we believe that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings and to return on equity and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value as noted earlier in this report we acquired over 76 million shares at a cost of 427 million in 2008 with excess cash flow if the free cash flow used for the repurchase of our common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds an estimated 11 million of additional investment income after tax would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have declined 9 to 499 because share purchases were made actual net income per share was 511 a lesser decline of 7 we intend to continue the repurchase of our common shares when conditions are favorable the majority of purchased shares are retired each year 

  

index to financial statements we maintain a significant availableforsale fixedmaturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities accounting rule sfas 115 requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets while sfas 115 requires invested assets to be revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets for this reason our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of sfas 115 when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of sfas 115 on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  

selected financial data 

  

  

     

effective in 2008 the fasb issued a new statement sfas 159 offering an option which if elected would permit us to value our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets  however unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our availableforsale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results therefore we do not intend to elect this option 

  

as discussed earlier in this report the fixed maturity portfolio incurred 18 million in net unrealized investment losses in 2008 11 million after tax and adjustments of deferred acquisition costs these unrealized losses are believed by management to have been brought on by widening credit spreads in financial markets and were the primary factor in the decline in our shareholders’ equity in 2008 share purchases in each of the years 2006 through 2008 were generally offset by net income having little impact on our total shareholders’ equity in those periods torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 115 times in 2008 compared with 128 times in 2007 and 116 times in 2006 a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 

  

index to financial statements credit ratings the credit quality of torchmark’s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies in 2008 standard  poor’s affirmed all credit ratings on torchmark and its subsidiaries however it revised its outlook to negative from stable for the company standard  poor’s cited our increased risk within our investment portfolio which has experienced significant unrealized losses concentrated in the financial sector they also noted that our share repurchase program has reduced our capitalization but that we were still well within a level adequate to support their rating fitch also revised its outlook to negative during 2008 during 2007 standard  poor’s lowered its credit rating on torchmark’s outstanding debt from a to a and lowered the rating of its preferred stock from a to bbb the credit rating change was attributed to weaker agent productivity recruiting and retention as well as changes in direct response strategy all of which have contributed to lower new sales during 2006 am best downgraded torchmark’s funded debt one notch from a to a and its preferred stock from a to bbb moody’s downgraded our funded debt from a3 to baa1 and our preferred stock from baa1 to baa2 both downgrades were to reflect the “notching” or widening of rating levels between the insurance companies and their parent company which has issued the debt this notching is typical for these rating agencies as they rate other insurance companies it does not reflect any change in the creditworthiness of the company the chart below presents torchmark’s credit ratings as of december 31 2008 

  

   

the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries are also rated by standard  poor’s and am best in 2007 standard  poor’s lowered its financial strength rating of united investors to a from a and the ratings of liberty globe united american and american income from aa to aa as a result of an expected lag in new business sales in the short term in 2006 a m best lowered its financial strength rating of united investors to a excellent from a superior as a result of torchmark’s diminished emphasis of that subsidiary’s business the following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2008 

  

   

am best states that it assigns a superior ratings to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time the am best a excellent rating is assigned to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated excellent overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a excellent companies have an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 

  

the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard  poor’s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics differing only slightly from those rated higher the minus sign  shows the relative standing within the major rating category the a rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries such punitive damage claims that are tried in alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined additionally it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 14 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

new unadopted accounting rules 

  

the fasb has issued certain new standards potentially applicable to torchmark effective in future periods 

  

business combinations   statement no 141r business combinations sfas 141r replaces the previous accounting guidance for the acquisition of other companies it retains the purchase method of accounting and the current guidance with respect to the accounting for indefinitelived intangibles and goodwill however the new statement provides certain significant differences most notably that all assets and liabilities including contingent liabilities are measured at their fair value as of the acquisition date rather than a cost allocation approach as previously required additionally all expenses of the acquisition are charged off as incurred rather than capitalized this statement is effective for torchmark as of january 1 2009 in the event there is an acquisition dated subsequent to that date 

  

noncontrolling interests   statement no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 51 sfas 160 changes the accounting for noncontrolling interests also known as minority interests at this time torchmark has no noncontrolling interests 

  

derivatives   statement no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment of fasb statement no 133 sfas 161 was issued in march 2008 expanding the disclosures about derivatives and hedging activities required under existing accounting guidance sfas 161 is effective for torchmark as of january 1 2009 as of december 31 2008 torchmark does not hold any of the derivative instruments subject to this statement 

  

financial guarantee insurance contracts   statement no 163 accounting for financial guarantee insurance contracts—an interpretation of fasb statement no 60 sfas 163 was issued in may 2008 to clarify accounting for such instruments torchmark does not offer this form of insurance and therefore this statement will not apply to us 

  

postretirement benefit plan assets the fasb issued in december 2008 fasb staff position 132r1 employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets fsp 132r1 this document requires additional disclosures about plan assets such as more detail information on asset categories investment strategies concentrations of credit risks and valuation techniques the valuation information is similar to the disclosures in sfas 157 for company investments fsp 132r1 also requires a discussion of the basis for the determination of the expected longtermrateofreturn assumption it is effective for annual periods for torchmark beginning in 2009 

  

index to financial statements critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note 5 — future policy benefit reserves  

  

approximately 73 of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2008 are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 60 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas 60 under which the liability is the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue under sfas 60 these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies a premium deficiency event for torchmark’s sfas 60 business is very rare and did not occur during the three years ended december 31 2008 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business reported under statement of financial accounting standards no 97 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain longduration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments sfas 97 under sfas 97 the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used in the determination of the sfas 97 future policy benefit liability 

  

deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales additionally the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption “value of insurance purchased” as indicated in note 4 — deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to consolidated financial statements our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

approximately 95 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2008 are accounted for under the provisions of sfas 60 for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for sfas 60 business are set at the time of contract issue under sfas 60 these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for our sfas 60 assets for any period in the three years ended december 31 2008 

  

the remaining portion of deferred acquisition costs pertain to business reported under sfas 97 for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin under sfas 97 the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised with the exception of variable annuities as discussed earlier in this report revisions related to our sfas 97 assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december 31 2008 the variable annuity block could sustain further increases in the level of amortization if equity markets do not stabilize amortization for sfas 97 blocks other than variable annuities is not expected to have a material impact on operations for the foreseeable future 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported 

  

index to financial statements claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

  

revenue recognition premium income from our subsidiaries’ insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected however in accordance with gaap revenues on limitedpayment contracts and universal lifetype contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently revenues on limitedpayment contracts are recognized over the contract period premium for deposit balance products such as our annuity and interestsensitive life policies is added to the policy account value the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance administration surrender and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder in each case benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 

  

we report investment income as revenue less investment expenses when it is earned our investment activities are integral to our insurance operations because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates contract liabilities and other product contract features these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on our net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in our insurance and annuity products for more information concerning revenue recognition investment accounting and interest sensitivity please refer to note 1 — significant accounting policies and note 3 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities investments and market risk sensitivity in this report 

  

valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to maintain our investment quality and diversification standards we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixedmaturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

during 2008 the values of our fixed maturities have also been affected by illiquidity in the financial markets which has contributed to a spread widening and accordingly unrealized losses on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products considerable information concerning the policies procedures classification levels and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixedmaturity investments are presented in note 3—investments under the caption fair value measurements  

  

impairment of investments we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value where fair value has declined below carrying value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for

defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2008 our net liability under these plans was 56 million 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected our discount rate rate of return on assets and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in note 9 — postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to us note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies and other related data

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

torchmark under the direction of the chairman and chief executive officer and the executive vice president and chief financial officer has established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by torchmark in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms the disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to torchmark’s management including the chairman and chief executive officer and the executive vice president and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 

  

as of the end of the fiscal quarter completed december 31 2008 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of torchmark management including the chairman and chief executive officer and the executive vice president and chief financial officer of torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures as those terms are defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based upon their evaluation the chairman and chief executive officer and the executive vice president and chief financial officer have concluded that torchmark’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the date of this form 10k in compliance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 18 usc § 1350 each of these officers executed a certification included as an exhibit to this form 10k 

  

as of the date of this form 10k for the quarter ended december 31 2008 there have not been any significant changes in torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect this control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of their evaluation which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting no material weaknesses in such internal controls were identified in the evaluation and as a consequence no corrective action was required to be taken

index to financial statements management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management at torchmark corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis as a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting the company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls accordingly even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time 

  

management evaluated the company’s internal control over financial reporting and based on its assessment determined that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2008 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of torchmark corporation and subsidiaries “torchmark” as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion torchmark maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2008 of torchmark and our report dated february 26 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

health insurance 

  

torchmark offers supplemental limitedbenefit health insurance products that include hospitalsurgical plans cancer and accident plans sold to individuals under age 65 these policies are designed to supplement health coverage that applicants already own or to provide affordable limitedbenefit coverage to individuals without access to more comprehensive coverage medicare supplements are also offered to enrollees in the traditional feeforservice medicare program all medicare supplement plans are standardized by federal regulation and are designed to pay deductibles and copayments not paid by medicare we also began offering medicare part d prescription drug insurance in 2006

annuities 

  

annuity products offered include singlepremium deferred annuities flexiblepremium deferred annuities and variable annuities in recent years torchmark has deemphasized the marketing of annuity products annuities in 2007 comprise less than 1 of premium income and less than 2 of insurance underwriting margin 

  

index to financial statements pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses all of which are generally based on company experience and on projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

  

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each subsidiary uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

  

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis a list of the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in the financial statements  see note 5 — future policy benefit reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

  

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities fixed maturities represented 94 of total investments at december 31 2007  see note 3 — investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis  

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

index to financial statements management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system at december 31 2007 torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in alabama indiana missouri nebraska and new york 

  

insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions 

  

personnel 

  

at the end of 2007 torchmark had 2354 employees and 1242 licensed employees under sales contracts 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a mature regulated industry populated by many firms torchmark operates in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

  

the life insurance industry is highly competitive and could limit torchmark’s ability to gain or maintain market share competition by product price and for market share is generally strong in the life insurance industry but is less so in torchmark’s life insurance niche markets in recent years most life insurers have targeted the smaller highly competitive higherincome market by offering asset accumulation products torchmark’s market has remained the middle income market offering individuallysold protection life insurance which is less competitive because the market is larger with fewer competing insurers and with less price sensitivity than the higher income asset accumulation marketplace 

  

index to financial statements torchmark’s life insurance markets are subject to risks of general economic conditions   because torchmark serves the middle income market for individual protection life insurance competition is primarily from alternative uses of the customer’s disposable income in times of economic downturns that affect employment levels potential customers may be less likely to buy policies and policyholders may fail to pay premiums 

  

torchmark’s life products are sold in selected niche markets the company is at risk should any of these markets diminish torchmark has two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches labor union members and sales via direct response distribution the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales in recent years labor union membership has grown little and has declined as a percentage of employed workers however torchmark’s unionmember policyholders are still a small portion of total union membership indicating that sales growth can continue for some time without growth in total union membership most of the company’s direct response business is either through direct mail solicitation or inserted into other mail media for distribution significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business 

  

the development and maintenance of torchmark’s various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales because the company’s life insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market the development maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical for agents adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates them to increase sales is very important in direct response continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies will in time lead to less than optimum growth in sales and ultimately in profits 

  

health insurance marketplace risk 

  

congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact torchmark’s medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of torchmark’s in force health insurance business because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future these changes could have either a positive or negative effect on that business in 2006 congress first provided prescription drug coverage medicare part d to medicare beneficiaries changes are likely to be made to the program over the next several years as the acceptance and costs of the program become clear some of these changes might adversely affect torchmark’s ability to profit from its medicare part d sales or the level of risk involved 

  

torchmark’s medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers the medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior  aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare such as health maintenance organizations hmos and other managed care or private plans the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance 

  

torchmark’s medicare supplement business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales in recent years price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market has been significant characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to under price new sales in order to gain market share torchmark believes these practices are not in the best interest of the company or consumers and has elected not to compete on those terms which has negatively affected sales should these industry practices continue it is likely that torchmark’s sales of this health product will remain depressed 

  

torchmark’s health business is at risk in the event of governmentsponsored underage65 health insurance currently torchmark’s leading health sales are from limited benefit products sold to people under age 65 these products are in demand when buyers are either self employed or their 

  

index to financial statements employers offer limited or no health insurance to employees if in the future the government offers comprehensive health care to people under age 65 demand for this product would likely decline however any government plan might provide beneficial opportunities if the plan includes the insurance industry as providers given the high cost and political challenges of such a program torchmark believes this is a lowlevel risk in the foreseeable future 

  

general operating risk 

  

changes in mortality economic conditions or other market conditions could significantly affect our operation and profitability the company’s insurance contracts are affected by the levels of mortality morbidity persistency and healthcare utilization that we experience the resulting levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set significant variations in these levels could negatively affect profit margins and income however the company’s actuaries continually test expected to actual results 

  

torchmark’s ability to pay dividends or service any of its debt or preferred securities is limited by the amounts its subsidiaries are able to pay to the holding company torchmark’s insurance company subsidiaries its principal sources of cash flow periodically declare and distribute dividends on their common and preferred stock held by torchmark the holding company torchmark’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock principal and interest on any debt security or dividends on any preferred stock security is affected by the ability of its subsidiaries to pay the holding company these dividends the insurance company subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to the holding company for example under certain state insurance laws an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations excluding capital gains and losses or 10 of statutory surplus without regulatory approval 

  

torchmark can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to torchmark by its subsidiaries additionally the inability to obtain approval of the previously mentioned premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact the profitability and thus the ability of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries to declare and distribute dividends 

  

a ratings downgrade could negatively affect torchmark’s ability to compete ratings are a factor in torchmark’s competitive position rating organizations periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers including the company’s insurance subsidiaries while ratings are less important in the middleincome market than in markets focused on higher incomes or the group market a downgrade in the ratings of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries could slightly affect the ability of the subsidiaries to market their products 

  

rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the considered factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to general economic conditions and circumstances outside of the company’s control 

  

investment risk 

  

the company’s investments are subject to market risks torchmark’s invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values factors that may affect these risks include interest rate levels financial market performance and general economic conditions as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of individual issuers some of these factors could result in writedowns of individual investments significant increases in interest rates could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of the fixed investment portfolio reflecting unrealized fair value losses this risk is mitigated by torchmark’s operating strategy to generally hold investments to maturity recognizing the longterm nature of the life policy reserve liabilities supported by investments and by torchmark’s strong operating cash flow that greatly diminishes the need to liquidate investments prior to maturity 

  

index to financial statements a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the rates credited to the net policy liabilities while torchmark attempts to manage its investments to preserve the excess investment income spread the company can give no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads 

  

significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in the company’s investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would likely be at lower rates 

  

regulatory risk 

  

regulatory changes could adversely affect our business insurance companies are subject to government regulation in each of the states in which they conduct business state agencies have broad administrative power over many aspects of the insurance business which may include premium rates marketing practices advertising licensing agents policy forms capital adequacy and permitted investments government regulators are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than our shareholders insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on its business furthermore the company cannot predict the timing or form of any future regulatory initiatives 

  

changes in taxation could negatively affect our income changes in the way the insurance industry is taxed or increases in tax rates could increase the company’s tax burden and negatively affect its income 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against the company or its subsidiaries a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark does business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states including alabama and mississippi juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit torchmark like other insurers is involved in this type of litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty 

  

natural disaster risk 

  

torchmark’s business is subject to risk of a catastrophic event the marketplaces of torchmark’s major subsidiaries are national in scope because the company’s insurance policies in force are relatively lowface amounts issued to large numbers of policyholders throughout the country the likelihood that a large portion of the company’s policyholder base would be affected by a natural disaster is not likely as a result it is unlikely that even a major natural disaster covering hundreds of miles would disrupt the marketing and premium collection in more than a small portion of torchmark’s markets in addition the administration of the four leading subsidiaries is conducted in three distant locations that allow the company to take advantage of those distances to plan backup administrative support for any one of the subsidiaries in the event of disaster the company also has outside contracts for offsite backup information systems and record keeping in the event of a disaster

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

torchmark and its subsidiaries in common with the insurance industry in general are subject to litigation including claims involving tax matters alleged breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmark’s subsidiaries employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on torchmark’s financial condition future operating results or liquidity however assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forwardlooking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges juries and appellate courts in the future this bespeaks caution particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as alabama and mississippi torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards continue to occur bearing little or no relation to actual damages awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business particularly alabama and mississippi creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit 

  

as previously reported in forms 10k and 10q liberty and torchmark were parties to purported class action litigation filed in the circuit court of choctaw county alabama on behalf of all persons who currently or in the past were insured under liberty cancer policies which were no longer being marketed regardless of whether the policies remained in force or lapsed  roberts v liberty national life insurance company  case no cv2002009b these cases were based on allegations of breach of contract in the implementation of premium rate increases misrepresentation regarding the premium rate increases fraud and suppression concerning the closed block of business and unjust enrichment on december 30 2003 the alabama supreme court issued an opinion granting liberty’s and torchmark’s petition for a writ of mandamus concluding that the choctaw circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction and ordering that circuit court to dismiss the action the plaintiffs then filed their purported class action litigation against liberty and torchmark in the circuit court of barbour county alabama on december 30 2003  roberts v liberty national life insurance company  civil action no cv030137 

  

index to financial statements on april 16 2004 the parties filed a written stipulation of agreement of compromise and settlement with the barbour county alabama circuit court seeking potential settlement of the roberts case a fairness hearing on the potential settlement was held by the barbour county circuit court with briefs received on certain issues materials relating to objections to the proposed settlement submitted to the courtappointed independent special master objectors to the potential settlement heard and a report of the courtappointed independent actuary received on certain issues thereafter

in an opinion issued on september 29 2006 the alabama supreme court voided the barbour county circuit court’s final judgment and dismissed the roberts appeal the supreme court held that the barbour county court lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction in roberts to certify the roberts class as a subclass of the robertson class and to enter a final judgment approving the settlement since roberts was filed as an independent class action collaterally attacking robertson rather than being filed in robertson under the barbour county court’s reserved continuing jurisdiction over that case on october 23 2006 liberty filed a petition with the barbour county circuit court under its continuing jurisdiction in robertson for clarification or in the alternative to amend the robertson final judgment liberty sought an order from the circuit court declaring that liberty pay benefits to robertson class members based upon the amounts accepted by providers in full payment of charges a hearing was held on liberty’s petition on march 13 2007

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and to a limited extent annuities to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the major insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully described in note 13 — business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and benefit administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is 

  

net investment income 

less 

interest credited to net policy liabilities 

financing costs 

  

the tables in note 13 — business segments reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ending december 31 2007 additionally this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates yeartoyear comparability and which reconciles to net income that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations net income increased 2 or 9 million to 528 million in 2007 and 5 or 23 million to 519 million in 2006 the life insurance segment contributed 20 million to pretax growth in the 2007 margin the largest contributor life insurance margin growth in 2007 resulted from both premium growth and favorable mortality also adding to 2007 pretax earnings growth was the investment segment from which excess investment income rose 5 million or 2 it had declined in both of the previous two years excess investment income in 2007 was positively affected by lower financing costs on our debt as a result of the refinancing of two debt issues in 2006 the primary contributor to growth in 2006 earnings was the health insurance segment as we first offered medicare part d for coverage beginning january 1 2006 our medicare part d product accounted for 26 million of the 30 million growth in health margins the life insurance segment also added 16 million to our 28 million growth in pretax earnings in 2006 excess investment income declined in both 2006 and 2005 as it was compressed by a flattened yield curve and as significant amounts of cash have been used to repurchase torchmark shares 

  

total revenues rose 2 in 2007 to 349 billion in 2006 total revenues increased 9 to 342 billion from 313 billion in 2005 growth in life premium of 46 million and net investment income of 20 million accounted for the growth in 2007 revenues the 2006 revenue increase was primarily the result of the 212 million of premium added from medicare part d growth in life premium and net investment income also contributed to 2006 revenue growth 

  

life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december 31 2007 rising 3 in 2007 to 16 billion and 4 in 2006 margins as a percentage of premium have also increased slightly each year to 27 of premium in 2007 from 26 in 2005 and 2006 while premium and margin percentage growth have resulted in increases in the total life insurance segment’s contribution to pretax earnings sales volumes have declined slightly each year life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption life insurance 

  

index to financial statements health premium was flat in 2007 compared with 2006 at 12 billion however it rose 22 or 223 million in 2006 from 10 billion in 2005 but 212 million of the growth came from medicare part d premium which was offered for the first time in 2006 since the majority of the country’s part d enrollees selected a plan in 2006 we do not expect significant growth in our part d business going forward medicare supplement has historically accounted for the largest portion of our health premium over the past few years however increased competition in the medicare supplement business has continued to dampen health sales and has resulted in declines in the premium from this product each year at the same time net sales of our underage65 limitedbenefit health products have grown significantly over the past few years as demand for these products continues to increase as a result premium from the limitedbenefit health products are expected to overtake medicare supplement premium in 2008 see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

  

while we still offer annuities we do not plan to emphasize annuity products favoring life insurance instead see the caption annuities for further discussion 

  

as previously mentioned the investment segment’s pretax profitability or excess investment income increased 5 million or 2 in 2007 after having declined 2 in each of the last two years the investment segment’s 2007 income was positively affected by a decline in our interest expense on debt due to the refinancing of the two funded debt issues noted below however growth in total investment income has been negatively affected by torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments management believes that the acquisition of torchmark stock at favorable prices provides a superior return on available cash additionally the lower longterm interest rates available for new investments during the past three years have caused our average portfolio yield to decline in each successive year restricting growth in net investment income and excess investment income at the same time shortterm rates have risen and stayed at higher levels during the threeyear period negatively affecting excess investment income during 2005 and continuing through mid2006 shortterm rates rose with no meaningful change in longterm rates the rising shortterm rates caused shortterm financing costs to increase and the income spread on torchmark’s fixedtovariable interestrate swaps to narrow because of the diminished profitability of these swaps all of the swaps were disposed of by june 2006 see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments for a more detailed discussion 

  

during the second quarter of 2006 we issued two new debt securities in separate public offerings 1 our 71 trust preferred securities redemption amount 120 million and 2 our 6 3  8  senior notes par value 250 million these offerings essentially provided funding for the repayment of two existing debt instruments in the fourth quarter of 2006 1 the call of our 7¾ trust preferred securities at a redemption price of 150 million and 2 the maturity of our 6¼ senior notes par value 180 million more information on these transactions can be found in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 

  

we had 2 million of aftertax realized investment gains in 2007 compared with aftertax realized investment losses of 7 million in 2006 there was an immaterial amount of aftertax realized investment gains in 2005 realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and may have a material positive or negative impact on net income under the caption realized gains and losses in this report we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses also as explained in note 13—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments 

  

in each of the years 2005 through 2007 net income was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring nonoperating items we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations a discussion of these items follows 

  

in 2005 we recorded an aftertax charge of 955 thousand 15 million pretax pertaining to litigation this litigation involved net settlements after expenses primarily in three significant legal matters our subsidiary liberty’s racedistinct mortalitydualpricing litigation its classaction cancer case and the 

  

index to financial statements waddell  reed litigation all of the settlements of these cases relate to litigation arising many years ago and are not relevant to current operations of this pretax amount 135 million is recorded as “other income” and 15 million is recorded as “other operating expense” in the 2005 consolidated statement of operations  for more information on these litigation items see note 14—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  also in 2005 we recorded a 16 million settlement benefit from an internal revenue service examination covering several years this tax settlement reduced tax expense more information on this tax settlement is provided in note 8—income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  additionally a noncash aftertax charge of 369 thousand was recorded as a result of the extension in the term of a previously granted stock option for a senior officer upon retirement the option extension expense was recorded as administrative expense in the 2005 consolidated statement of operations  

  

in 2006 we received four litigation and tax settlements two of which were concerned with issues related to a subsidiary and an investment disposed of several years ago a third involving our investment in worldcom inc bonds worldcom which was held and sold in prior years and a fourth concerning federal income tax issues arising from examinations of prior years the first settlement involving the disposed subsidiary resulted in state income tax refunds of 67 million net of expenses 43 million net of tax which were received and reported above as a tax settlement the second settlement involving the investment resulted in proceeds of 51 million net of expenses 33 million net of tax and is included in the table above as a legal settlement in the third settlement we received 63 million 41 million after tax in connection with our worldcom classaction litigation for recovery of a portion of investment losses this item is included in the table above as a litigation settlement the federal income tax settlement resulted in benefits due us of 74 million included as tax settlements in the table above the two litigation settlements were included in “other income” and the two tax settlements reduced “income taxes” in the 2006 consolidated statement of operations  all four of these cases involved litigation or issues arising years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations 

  

additionally in 2006 liberty began a program to dispose of its agency office buildings replacing them with rental facilities in 2006 21 buildings were sold for gross proceeds of 67 million and a pretax gain of 48 million because of the significant scale of this nonoperating item we have removed 43 million 28 million after tax from our core results representing the gain from the sales 

  

liberty’s program to dispose of its agency office buildings continued in 2007 as a result 21 additional buildings were sold for proceeds of 64 million and a pretax gain of 43 million 28 million after tax also in 2007 additional legal costs or settlements from litigation relating to prior periods were recorded we received an additional 515 thousand 334 thousand after tax in settlement proceeds from the worldcom litigation discussed above we also incurred additional costs relating to liberty national’s racedistinct pricing litigation that was settled in 2005 and was also discussed above these costs were 933 thousand 606 thousand after tax additionally in 2007 we recorded a federal income tax benefit of 11 million relating primarily to settlements of prior year examinations presented as “tax settlements” in the table above this item reduced “income taxes” in the 2007 consolidated statement of operations  see note 8 for more information on this settlement 

  

we redomesticated two of our insurance subsidiaries united american and globe to the state of nebraska in 2007 this redomestication will benefit us going forward by reducing premium tax rates in these companies we plan to redomesticate other subsidiaries to nebraska in the future 

  

index to financial statements torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 and was reaffirmed at its july 26 2007 board of director’s meeting with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december 31 2007

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows 

  

life insurance life insurance is our largest insurance segment with 2007 life premium representing 55 of total premium life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 66 of the total in 2007 additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

life insurance premium rose 3 to 157 billion in 2007 after having increased 4 in 2006 to 152 billion life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows

premium by distribution method 

dollar amounts in thousands 

  

   

we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any 

  

index to financial statements given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue net sales is annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 

  

annualized life premium in force was 167 billion at december 31 2007 an increase of 4 over 162 billion a year earlier annualized life premium in force was 158 billion at december 31 2005

direct response is our leading writer of life insurance the direct response operation consists of two primary components direct mail and insert media direct mail targets primarily young middleincome households with children the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisitioncost targets for sales of additional coverage over time at this time we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response’s premier markets 

  

index to financial statements insert media which targets primarily the adult market involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media such as coupon packets newspapers bank statements and billings this media was historically placed by direct marketing and advertising distributors inc dmad previously an unrelated entity with which we have had a business relationship for fifteen years we acquired dmad in january 2007 for 47 million and integrated their operations during 2007 this acquisition allows the company to expand marketing opportunities through increased solicitation volume and also improve margins through cost savings in the insert media component over the period of our relationship with dmad the insert media component has grown to the point that it now represents over half of direct response net sales however in the last half of 2006 dmad substantially reduced insert media solicitations resulting in declines in reported net sales in the first half of 2007 net sales from insert media are generated four to seven months following the initial sales solicitation we believe that the dmad purchase will favorably impact direct response sales going forward 

  

the direct response operation accounted for 31 of our life insurance premium during 2007 the largest of any distribution group direct response’s share of total life premium has risen steadily in each of the last three years as illustrated in the chart above life premium for this channel rose 6 in 2007 and 8 in 2006 net sales declined 1 in 2007 to 114 million after having risen 2 in 2006 to 115 million firstyear collected premium declined 2 in 2007 to 76 million but grew 1 in 2006 to 77 million 

  

the american income exclusive agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions but also on credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios life premium for this agency rose 8 to 440 million in 2007 after having increased 8 in 2006 net sales increased 7 in 2007 to 92 million from 86 million in 2006 net sales rose 2 in 2006 firstyear collected premium rose 2 in 2007 to 74 million after having decreased 2 in 2006 as in the case of all of torchmark’s agency distribution systems continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count growth in the agent count has contributed to the improvements in sales in this agency net sales a lead indicator of new sales rose in both years and firstyear collected premium turned positive in 2007 after a decline in 2006 the american income agent count was 2545 at december 31 2007 compared with 2353 a year earlier an increase of 8 the agent count rose 16 in 2006 from 2027 at year end 2005 this agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business additionally the systematic centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets its life products to primarily middleincome customers in southeastern states liberty’s life premium declined 2 in 2007 and 1 in 2006 compared with the respective prior year liberty’s life premium sales in terms of net sales were 37 million in 2007 representing a decrease of 11 in 2007 net sales also decreased 12 in 2006 firstyear collected premium declined 16 in 2007 to 29 million firstyear collected premium declined 5 in 2006 

  

growth in the liberty agency’s sales and premium volume are highly dependent on building the size of its agency force liberty has implemented initiatives similar to those of american income to recruit new agents primarily through the use of the internet the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems liberty’s agent count rose 49 to 2060 at december 31 2007 from 1381 a year earlier this compared with a decline of 22 in 2006 and an increase of 9 in 2005 most of the growth in the 2007 agent count occurred in the latter half of the year as these new agents become trained and more seasoned they should become more productive declines in net sales in both 2007 and 2006 were attributable primarily to the 2006 declines in agent count in 2006 the liberty national agency began the reorganization of its marketing leadership and restructured its agent compensation system to provide greater reward to productive agents and to establish production minimums for agents these changes led to terminations and resignations during 2006 of agents not meeting these production minimums however management believes that these changes will result in a more productive agency over the long term management also believes these changes are responsible for recent margin improvements increased sales from a larger and more productive agency force should lead to increased premium growth 

  

index to financial statements we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the united investors agency the military agency the united american independent and branch office agencies and other small miscellaneous sales agencies the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business united investors represents approximately 5 of torchmark’s life premium income the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of wholelife products with term insurance riders military premium represents 13 of life premium the united american independent and branch office agencies combined represented approximately 3 of torchmark’s total life premium life premium income for these two agencies has declined for the past three years because they focus on health insurance with life sales being incidental

gross margins as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense rose 5 in 2007 to 417 million after rising 4 in 2006 and 8 in 2005 as a percentage of life insurance premium gross margins have increased slightly each year and were 27 in 2007 improvements in life margins have resulted from several factors margin improvement in 2007 was primarily the result of premium growth but favorable mortality was also a positive factor this improvement in mortality is not expected to be a trend in 2006 the previouslymentioned changes in liberty’s agent compensation system contributed to increases in liberty’s margins as this new system has reduced acquisition costs at liberty additionally the proportion of american income premium to total premium has grown each year and that has caused life margins to increase because that agency’s margins are torchmark’s highest well exceeding 30 in all periods mortality improvement in the military agency was also a major factor in the 2006 improvement 

  

index to financial statements health insurance health products sold by torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical plans cancer and accident plans sold to people under age 65 we also sell medicare supplements to enrollees in the federal medicare program as well as providing coverage under the medicare part d prescription drug program beginning january 1 2006 because medicare part d is a significant new health product and there is no comparative prior year data in 2005 medicare part d business will be shown as a separate health component and will be discussed separately in the analysis of the health segment health premium represented 44 of torchmark’s total premium income in 2007 excluding part d premium health premium represented 39 in 2007 compared with 40 in both 2006 and 2005 health underwriting margin excluding part d accounted for 30 of the total in 2007 compared with 31 of the total in both 2006 and 2005 these declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years

index to financial statements we market supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels with the two united american agencies being our market leaders over the past several years we have placed greater emphasis on the sale of limitedbenefit health insurance products rather than medicare supplement insurance as customer demand for the limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical plans has increased and price competition and lesser demand for medicare supplements has dampened sales of that product while medicare supplement still remains our largest health product in terms of premium income the premium from other limitedbenefit health products have been growing rapidly as shown in the chart above medicare supplement premium represented 51 of total health premium excluding part d in 2007 but has declined steadily as a percentage of total health premium in each successive year accordingly limitedbenefit health products have increased as a percentage of total health premium before part d each year during the same period

the united american branch office and independent agencies as discussed above the two united american agencies have emphasized sales of individual supplemental limitedbenefit health plans known generally as hospitalsurgical plans for which demand has increased in recent years these plans generally provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined a fixedamount surgical schedule out patient coverage and other miscellaneous hospitalrelated charges they also contain caps on total perillness benefits consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual majormedical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limitedbenefit plans are generally lower than those of medicare supplement however the medicare supplement product has historically had slightly higher persistency rates resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium both of the united american agencies offer these limitedbenefit plans 

  

index to financial statements the united american branch office is an exclusive agency meaning the agents in its 155 offices nationwide sell only for us in recent years this agency has been successful in building sales of limitedbenefit plans to replace the decline in medicare supplement sales net sales of limitedbenefit plans in 2007 were 152 million rising 4 in 2006 net sales rose 88 to 147 million as a result total health sales at the ua branch office were 162 million a 2 increase over 2006 including the decline in medicare supplement sales however in 2006 total net health sales for this agency increased 66 as a result of the growth in limitedbenefit sales total health premium rose 9 in 2007 to 387 million compared with a 10 increase in 2006 to 355 million taking the decline in the medicare supplement in force block into account after growing very rapidly over the past few years the producing agent count in the ua branch office declined 1 as of december 31 2007 to 2979 from 3015 in 2006 the producing agent count rose 39 after growing 29 a year earlier as is the case with all of our captive agencies growing the agency size translates into increased sales and premium growth 

  

the united american independent agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large multistate organizations down to oneperson offices all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies of which 3439 were active producing agents for torchmark at december 31 2007 health premium for the ua independent agency declined 7 to 388 million in 2007 after declining 5 in 2006 the declines in premium are due to the decreases in medicare supplement premium this block of business continues to decline as sales have not compensated for lapses this agency’s contribution to torchmark’s total health sales and premium has declined in each of the past three years even though net sales of limitedbenefit products declined in each of the last three years each year’s new sales have added to premium in force resulting in the increases in limitedbenefit premium in the recent past most of this agency’s health sales came from one large independent agency in 2005 that leading agency’s recruiting and training program experienced a disruption that resulted in a decline in producing agents the disruption resulted in a 32 drop in 2005 net sales sales from this agency have not recovered 

  

liberty national exclusive agency  predominately a life insurance distribution channel is the third largest writer of torchmark health business based on premium collected cancer supplemental plans are the type of limitedbenefit health products primarily produced by this agency liberty is our only distribution channel for which cancer insurance is its primary health product liberty’s health premium declined 3 in 2007 to 141 million after a 3 drop in 2006 the declines in premium have resulted from the settlement of a classaction lawsuit in early 2005 concerning a closed block of cancer business over the timing and size of the premium rate increases on this block this block represented approximately half of liberty’s cancer business in 2005 and approximately 37 at year end 2007 prior to 2005 significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on this block were a continuing factor causing growth in health premium but increasing claims continued to reduce underwriting margins the settlement provided for reduced benefits paid going forward and further required liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an 85 claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business 

  

net health sales in the liberty agency for 2007 declined 16 to 10 million compared with 2006 net health sales of 12 million net health sales were 14 million in 2005 one factor in the decline in health sales at liberty has been the increased emphasis on selling the highermargin life products another issue had been the decline in agent counts in recent periods as a result of a change in the agent compensation system in 2006 to improve persistency and margins however as a result of recruiting and training initiatives the agent count rose from 1381 at year end 2006 to 2060 at year end 2007 an increase of 49 

  

american income exclusive agency also predominately a life insurance distribution channel is our fourth largest health insurance distributor based on 2007 premium collected its health plans are comprised of various limitedbenefit plans for which almost two thirds of the agency’s 2007 health premium was from accident policies sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 

  

health premium at this agency for 2007 increased 5 to 71 million while 2006 premium of 67 million increased 6 over 2005 net health sales were 113 million in 2007 compared with 117 million in 2006 and 113 million in 2005 net health sales comprised only 11 of the american income agency’s total net sales in 2007 

  

index to financial statements direct response  primarily a life operation also offers health insurance which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups in 2007 net health sales were 5 million comprising only 5 of direct response’s total life and health net sales these net sales rose 2 in 2007 but declined 10 in 2006 health premium in 2007 for this group rose 7 to 42 million health premium in 2006 was 40 million a 5 increase 

  

medicare part d torchmark through its subsidiary united american began offering insurance coverage under the government’s medicare part d plan as of january 1 2006 the medicare part d plan is a standalone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american unlike the traditional medicare program for hospital and doctor services where cms is the primary insurer and private medicare supplement insurers are secondary insurers the program generally calls for cms to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium total medicare part d premium was 215 million in 2007 compared with 212 million in 2006 enrollment for all part d coverages ends on december 31 of the previous year except for enrollees who reach age 65 in the current year at december 2006 united american had approximately 189 thousand enrollees for the 2007 part d plan although final enrollment has not been confirmed we expect a decline in enrollees for the 2008 plan year our medicare part d product is sold primarily through the direct response operation but is also sold by the two ua agencies part d net sales were 38 million in 2007 compared with 278 million in 2006 as we count only sales to new firsttime enrollees in net sales the majority of 2007 premium income was from previous enrollees 

  

we believe that the medicare part d program is an excellent addition to our health product offerings because of our experience with the seniorage market and with medicare supplements the government assurances with regard to the risksharing agreements for participating insurers the incremental income added to our health insurance margins and the renewal of the business every year our experience with service to the seniorage market and use of our direct response marketing system required little new investment to enter this business as previously mentioned we view the medicare part d product separately from our other health products because of its significance and because there are no prior year comparisons with 2005 

  

we do not expect significant growth in the part d product in the near future as most medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a plan in 2006 additionally as with any governmentsponsored program the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market

index to financial statements torchmark’s health insurance underwriting margin excluding part d before other income and administrative expense increased 2 in 2007 to 184 million from 181 million in 2006 margin also rose 2 as a percentage of premium underwriting margin increased from 177 in 2006 to 179 in 2007 after having risen from 175 in 2005 these increases were primarily the result of the reduced loss ratios in the previouslymentioned closed block of cancer business at liberty and improvements in american income’s loss ratios especially in 2006 liberty’s health margins increased 6 million or 20 in 2007 or 24 of health premium they also rose 3 million to 29 million in 2006 representing 20 of premium american income’s margins rose 3 million to 24 million in 2006 and 2 million to 26 million in 2007 36 of premium in both periods

annuities generate earnings from periodic policy fees and charges based on the average account balances reduced by net policy obligations and acquisition costs for fixed annuities net required interest on reserves is the required interest credited to the accounts and is offset by investment income 

  

for the three periods shown in the chart above account balances declined resulting in reductions in policy fees and charges accordingly insurance underwriting margin for annuities before other income and administrative expenses declined in each period and was 93 million in 2007 as a percentage of policy charges margins rose slightly in 2006 to 52 but fell to 46 in 2007 the 2007 decline in margins resulted from increased acquisition costs ratios due to the unlocking of deferred acquisition costs related to guaranteed minimum death benefit business we expect higher amortization of acquisition costs going forward in all three periods investment income earned exceeded required interest credited to fixed accounts a significant portion of annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements this spread results in negative net policy obligations 

  

index to financial statements administrative expenses operating expenses are included in the other and corporate segments and are classified into two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company the following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2007

insurance administrative expenses as a percentage of premium declined to 55 in 2007 from 56 in 2006 and 59 in 2005 the decline in the 2007 ratio occurred even though legal expense rose 49 million a major factor in this increase was the affirmation of an earlier jury verdict in insurance claim litigation in the amount of 19 million the increase in legal expense was offset by declines in employee costs other than salaries and in a 21 million decline in medicare part d direct administrative expense one factor in the decline in insurance administrative expense resulted from the previouslymentioned changes implemented in liberty’s agent compensation system these changes resulted in reductions in agent salaries and related employee costs of approximately 28 million in 2007 compared with the prior period management believes that these salary reductions could be replaced by higher deferred acquisition costs going forward as the compensation system changes emphasize a commissionbased agent compensation system rather than salaries commissions on new product sales are deferred and amortized over the premiumpaying life of the business the medicare part d administrative costs were lower in 2007 because open enrollment was still in effect in 2006 until may 15 causing us to incur additional administrative expense in that year open enrollment for the 2007 plan year was closed on december 31 2006 the 2006 ratio of expense to premium also declined even after including the 5 million of medicare part d administrative expense for the first time in 2006 decreased legal costs were a primary factor as several ongoing issues were resolved in 2005 and 2006 

  

parent company expense rose 20 million or 25 in 2007 included in 2007 expense is a onetime charge in the amount of 16 million for expenses incurred related to an acquisition bid that was not successful 

  

  

index to financial statements as noted in the summary of operations in this discussion we settled litigation in connection with liberty’s racedistinct mortality dualpricing litigation and its classaction cancer case in 2005 settlement charges and expenses for both cases were recorded in 2005 in the amount of 15 million and additional expenses of 933 thousand were recorded in 2007 both of these cases arose many years ago as previously noted we do not consider the costs of settling litigation applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations stock compensation expense rose due to a higher fair value assigned to recent grants primarily as a result of the increase in the torchmark stock price and due to restricted stock granted in late 2006 and mid2007 for the first time in several years as stated in note 13—business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 

  

investments the investment segment is responsible for the management of capital resources including investments debt and cash flow excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 1 3— business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986 we have used 36 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  

    

  

index to financial statements excess investment income increased 5 million or 2 in 2007 over the prior year excess investment income declined 2 in both 2006 and 2005 on a per diluted share basis 2007 excess investment income rose 7 to 338 per share excess investment income increased 3 in 2006 and 4 in 2005 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income which rose 3 to 649 million in 2007 it increased 4 to 628 million in 2006 from 603 million in 2005 as presented in the following chart the growth in net investment income in both periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets 

  

   

the lower growth in income is reflective of new investments made each year at longterm yields lower than the portfolio’s average yield resulting from the lower rates available in financial markets in recent years in 2007 we purchased 256 million of taxexempt municipal securities this was another factor in limiting the growth of net investment income relative to average assets as the yields available on municipal bonds are lower but produce significant tax savings also contributing to the lower growth in yields in recent years were calls on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio as the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities given the sizeable annual cash flow from our operations we expect mean invested assets to continue to grow but as long as rates available for new investments do not exceed our portfolio yield the rate of growth of investment income will be under pressure more detailed information about investment acquisitions follows under this caption 

  

excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table

index to financial statements the average interest crediting rate has risen in each of the last three years in 2001 as part of our normal review of policy reserve assumptions we increased the interest rate assumption 100 basis points 1 on policies issued after january 1 2001 as this group of policies becomes a larger proportion of our business the average crediting rate will continue to increase for more specific information on life and health crediting rates please refer to note 5—future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs

the table below presents the components of financing costs 

  

analysis of financing costs 

amounts in thousands 

  

   

financing costs declined 5 million or 7 in 2007 they increased 36 or 19 million in 2006 the primary factor in the 2007 decrease as well as the 2006 increase in financing costs was the refinancing in 2006 of two of our funded debt issues our 6¼ senior notes 180 million principal amount matured and our 7¾ trust preferred securities 150 million redemption value were called in the fourth quarter of 2006 these repayments were essentially funded by the issuance of two new instruments in the second quarter of 2006 our 6 3  8  senior notes 250 million principal amount and our 71 trust preferred securities 120 million principal amount because the new issues were offered several months before the other securities were repaid interest on funded debt increased 11 million it should be noted however that we invested the proceeds of the new offerings and the investment income from those proceeds offset the increased financing costs having little impact on excess investment income partially offsetting the decline in interest on funded debt in 2007 was an increase in interest on shortterm debt while higher shortterm rates were a factor the primary cause of the increase was a higher average balance of our commercial paper outstanding in 2007 which rose 43 to 238 million 

  

index to financial statements increased shortterm rates were also a factor in the 2006 increase in financing costs impacting us in two ways most notable was the effect that rising short rates had on our interest rate swaps which we originally entered into to exchange our fixedinterest commitments for floatingrate commitments in the lowinterest environment experienced in the past several years these swaps provided us with a considerable spread between our actual interest cost and what our fixed interest cost would have been in 2004 shortterm rates began to rise for the next two years resulting in significant declines in the benefit of all of our swaps because of the possibility that continued rising shortterm rates could cause our spreads to become negative we disposed of all swap instruments as of the second quarter of 2006 nevertheless the reduction in positive spreads on settlements from the swaps caused financing costs to increase 7 million in 2006 as a result of the dispositions of the swaps our only exposure to variable rates at december 31 2007 was our commercial paper borrowing program of which 202 million was outstanding in addition to their impact on our swaps rising shortterm rates were also the primary factor in the 1 million increase in interest on our commercial paper borrowings in 2006 more information concerning the debt offerings repayments and swaps is disclosed in note 1 0— debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

investment acquisitions  during calendar years 2005 through 2007 torchmark invested almost exclusively in investmentgrade fixedmaturity securities the following chart summarizes selected information for fixed maturity acquisitions in the years 2005 through 2007 investment grade corporate securities include both bonds and trustpreferred securities which are classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors the effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield this date is commonly known as the “worst call date” for noncallable bonds the worst call date is always the maturity date for callable bonds the worst call date is the call date that produces the lowest yield or the maturity date if the yield calculated to the maturity date is lower than the yield calculated to each call date two different average life calculations are shown average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date 

  

fixed maturity acquisitions selected information 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

when yields available on acceptablequality longterm maturity date more than 20 years after the acquisition date securities are sufficient to meet our yield and spread objectives we generally prefer to invest in such securities because they more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities during periods when we cannot invest in longterm securities that meet our objectives we generally invest in shorterterm maturity date less than 5 years after the acquisition date securities we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a makewhole basis prior to maturity we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so 

  

for investments in callable bonds the actual life of the investment will depend on whether or not and if so when the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date given our investments in callable 

  

index to financial statements bonds the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment we do know that the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 

  

during 20052007 especially during 2005 there have been periods when yields available on acceptablequality longterm noncallable securities did not meet our objectives during such periods we have invested in shorterterm securities some of these periods were characterized by relatively flat or inverted yield curves during such periods we did not have to give up much yield to invest in shorterterm securities and we took on less credit risk than had we invested longerterm prior to 2007 we generally did not invest in securities with maturity dates more than 30 years after the acquisition date during 2007 we invested some funds in hybrid securities bonds trust preferred securities and redeemable preferred stocks with very long scheduled maturity dates often exceeding 50 years in virtually all cases such hybrid securities are callable many years prior to the scheduled maturity date 

  

as shown in the chart above the effective annual yield and average life to maturity on funds invested during 2005 is significantly lower than that of funds invested during 2006 and 2007 this difference is reflective of the fact that consistent with the investment environment and strategy described above we invested relatively more funds in lower yielding shorterterm investments in 2005 than we did in 20062007 due primarily to our investments in hybrid securities as described above the average life of funds invested during 2007 to both next call and maturity is significantly higher than that of investments during 20052006 given the longterm fixedrate characteristics of our policy liabilities we believe that investments with average lives in excess of 20 years are appropriate 

  

new cash flow available to us for investment was affected by issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past three years issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost calls increase funds available for investment but they can negatively affect portfolio yield if they cause us to replace higheryielding bonds with those available at lower prevailing yields issuer calls were 848 million in 2007 229 million in 2006 and 226 million in 2005 

  

as long as we continue our current investment strategy and the average yield on new investments is less than the average yield of the portfolio and of assets disposed of the average yield on fixed maturity assets in the portfolio should decline because of the significant investable cash flow generated from investments and operations torchmark will benefit if yield rates available on new investments increase 

  

portfolio analysis because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixedmaturity securities the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms the following table presents a comparison of torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2007 with the latest industry data 

  

    

for an analysis of our fixedmaturity portfolio by component at december 31 2007 and 2006 and for a schedule of maturities see note 3 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements additional information concerning the fixedmaturity portfolio is as follows 

  

fixed maturity portfolio selected information 

  

      

at the end of 2007 and 2006 the fixedmaturity portfolio had a gross unrealized gain of 247 million and 319 million respectively gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities were 350 million at december 31 2007 compared with 90 million a year earlier please see note 3—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an analysis of unrealized investment losses 

  

credit risk sensitivity credit risk is the level of certainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities credit risk is a concern we mitigate this ongoing risk in part by acquiring investmentgrade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis at december 31 2007 approximately 94 of invested assets at fair value were held in fixedmaturity securities the major rating agencies considered 92 of this portfolio to be investment grade the average quality rating of the portfolio is a the table below demonstrates the credit rankings of torchmark’s fixedmaturity portfolio at fair value as of december 31 2007 

  

   

our current investment policy is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

index to financial statements we additionally reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors the following table presents the industry sectors that exceeded 2 of the corporate fixedmaturity portfolio at fair value at december 31 2007 

  

   

otherwise no individual industry represented more than 2 of torchmark’s corporate fixed maturities 

  

we have no direct investment exposure to subprime or alta mortgages loans for which the credit score was acceptable but some of the typical documentation was not provided we have no derivatives or any other offbalance sheet investment arrangements as all of our investments are carried on our consolidated balance sheet s we have 115 million at fair value 132 million book value invested in collateralized debt obligations cdos for which the average bloomberg composite rating at december 31 2007 was a the collateral underlying these cdos is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies and no subprime or alta mortgages are included in the collateral 

  

market risk sensitivity the primary market risk to which torchmark’s financial securities are exposed is interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since the portfolio is comprised 94 of fixedmaturity investments it is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value however we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however in accordance with gaap these liabilities are not marked to market 

  

index to financial statements the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2007 and 2006 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points 

  

   

realized gains and losses our life and health insurance carriers collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits we also incur acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

because our investment portfolio is large and diverse investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses occur only incidentally usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to the core insurance operation of providing insurance coverage to policyholders unlike investment income realized gains and losses are not considered in determining premium rates or product profitability of our insurance products 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations and as a result can have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the periodtoperiod trends of net income to not be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons and in line with industry practice we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results

in 2007 we wrote down certain nonfinancial institution holdings to estimated fair value as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met some or all of our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in note 3 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our critical accounting policies in this report the pretax charge for this impairment was 11 million 7 million after tax at the time of impairment these securities were carried at a value of 48 million later during 2007 a portion of these securities were sold for proceeds of 19 million with the remainder held at december 31 2007 valued at 18 million 

  

as discussed in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we redeemed our 7¾ trust preferred securities in 2006 recording a pretax loss of 55 million 36 million after tax additionally in 2006 we repurchased with the intent to retire 33 million principal amount of our 7 7  8  notes recording a pretax loss of 415 thousand 270 thousand after tax 

  

in years prior to 2007 we entered into interestrate swap agreements swapping our fixedrate commitments on our longterm debt for floatingrate commitments accounting rules required us to value our interestrate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period recording changes as a component of “realized investment gains losses because the fair values of these instruments fluctuated with interest rates in financial markets and diminished with time we never considered these fluctuations in managing ongoing operations as explained earlier under the caption investments  the outlook for shortterm rate increases in late 2005 and the expectation of even greater shortterm rate increases in 2006 could have caused the spreads on our swaps to become unprofitable in the future therefore we sold two of our swaps in the third quarter of 2005 and the remaining two swaps in the second quarter of 2006 so that no swaps were held after june 2006 complete information on our swaps including the accounting policies is found in note 1—significant accounting policies and in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

index to financial statements financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

our insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs sources of cash flows from operations include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes 

  

operating cash inflows significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers such as torchmark expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods sometimes many years later an actuarially computed reserve is carried in the financial statements for these future benefits earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period but there is no corresponding cash outlay therefore cash provided from operations is generally expected to exceed net income cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of the investment portfolio cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements available cash flows are also used to repay debt to buy back torchmark shares to pay shareholder dividends and for other corporate uses 

  

cash flows provided from operations were 850 million in 2007 865 million in 2006 and 858 million in 2005 in addition we received 13 billion in investment maturities repayments and calls in 2007 adding to available cash flows such repayments were 606 million in 2006 and 473 million in 2005 

  

we have in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 600 million for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility see the commercial paper section of note 10 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

our cash and shortterm investments were 131 million at yearend 2007 and 173 million at yearend 2006 additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 92 billion at december 31 2007 however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet dividend payments on common and preferred stock interest and principal repayment requirements on parentcompany debt and operating expenses of the parent company for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 11 — shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as fully described and discussed in note 10 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt torchmark had outstanding 120 million par amount 71 trust preferred securities at both december 31 2007 and 2006 the capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders the trust is an offbalance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules deconsolidation is required because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest therefore torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity even though we own all of the entity’s voting equity and have guaranteed the entity’s performance while these liabilities are not on our consolidated balance sheets  they are represented by torchmark’s 71 junior subordinated debentures due to the trust these junior subordinated debentures were a torchmark liability of 124 million par and book value at both december 31 2007 and 2006 these securities are indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption capital resources in this report the 71 preferred dividends 

  

index to financial statements due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our 71 interest payment on our debt to the trusts as described in note 14 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 

  

pension obligations to our employees primarily are obligations of trust fund entities which are not reflected on our balance sheet the obligations of these trusts are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans these trust entities hold assets which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the pension obligations as they become due the difference in our pension obligations and the fair value of the assets which fund those obligations are included on our balance sheet s  

  

as of december 31 2007 we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of thirdparty entities other than as described above all of our guarantees other than the trust preferred guarantee were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 14 — commitments and contingencies 

  

the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december 31 2007 

  

amounts in millions 

  

       

capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in note 10 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements longterm funded debt junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities and shareholders’ equity the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark’s capital trusts which are liable for its trust preferred securities in accordance with gaap these instruments are included in “due to affiliates” on the consolidated balance sheets a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

  

index to financial statements the carrying value of the funded debt was  722 million at december 31 2007 compared with 721 million a year earlier during the second quarter of 2006 we registered and issued two new security offerings our 71 trust preferred securities offered through torchmark capital trust iii at a redemption value of 120 million less issue expenses and our 6 3  8  senior notes issued for the principal amount of 250 million less issue expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006 we redeemed our 7 3  4  trust preferred securities and we repaid our 6 1  4  senior notes which matured the trust preferreds were redeemed for 150 million plus accrued dividends and our senior notes were repaid in the principal amount of 180 million plus accrued interest specific information about the new securities offered and the securities repaid in 2006 including the uses of proceeds and sources of funding is disclosed and discussed in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

over the past several years we have entered into swap agreements to exchange the fixedrate commitments on our funded debt for floatingrate commitments during the low interestrate environment in recent years these swaps were very beneficial in reducing our interest cost as discussed under the captions investments excess investment income and realized gains and losses in this report as shortterm rates rose in 2005 and 2006 with no meaningful change in longterm rates these swaps became less profitable because we believed that the swap settlements could have possibly become unprofitable we disposed of these agreements during 2005 and 2006 and held no swap agreements after june 2006 information about the history of our swaps is found in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption interest rate swaps  

  

in the second quarter of 2005 we executed a voluntary stock option exercise and restoration program in which 120 directors employees and consultants exercised vested options in torchmark’s common stock and received a lesser number of new options at the current market price as a result we issued 58 million new shares to the participants however a substantial number of the new shares were immediately sold through the open market by the participants to cover the option exercise price of their new shares and their related income taxes as a result of the program management’s ownership in torchmark increased and the company received a significant tax benefit from the exercise of the options we received 213 million in proceeds for the exercise price and 37 million in tax benefits both of which added to shareholder’s equity however as previously mentioned we generally use the proceeds of option exercises to repurchase shares on the open market to reduce the dilution caused by option exercises as a result the total impact on shareholder’s equity and cash flow from the transaction was immaterial more information on stock options and this program is found in note 1—significant accounting policies and in note 12—stockbased compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe that the most beneficial use of our excess cash flow could be a strategic acquisition absent an acquisition we believe that the best use of excess cash is to buy company stock as previously mentioned our board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the stock repurchase program in july 2007 in amounts and timing that management in consultation with the board determined to be in the best interest of the company we have repurchased common stock every year since 1986 except for 1995 the year following the acquisition of american income since the beginning of 1998 we have repurchased 52 million shares at a total cost of 23 billion and have acquired no fewer than 34 million shares in any one year we believe that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings return on equity and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value as noted earlier in this report we acquired over 61 million shares at a cost of 402 million in 2007 with excess cash flow if the free cash flow used for the repurchase of our common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds an estimated 110 million of additional investment income after tax would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have increased 6 to 542 because share purchases were made actual net income per share was 550 an increase of 7 we intend to continue the repurchase of our common shares when prices are favorable the majority of purchased shares are retired each year 

  

we maintain a significant availableforsale fixedmaturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities accounting rule sfas 115 requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio result primarily from changes in interest rates in financial markets while sfas 115 requires invested assets to be revalued accounting rules do not permit 

  

index to financial statements interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact in the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets for this reason our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of sfas 115 when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of sfas 115 on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  

selected financial data 

  

      

as discussed under the caption new unadopted accounting policies in this report the fasb has issued a new statement offering an option which if elected would permit us to value our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets  however unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our availableforsale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results therefore we will not elect this option 

  

torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 128 times in 2007 compared with 116 times in 2006 and 130 times in 2005 a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 

  

credit ratings the credit quality of torchmark’s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies during 2007 standard  poor’s lowered its credit rating on torchmark’s outstanding debt from a to a and lowered the rating of its preferred stock from a to bbb the credit rating change was attributed to weaker agent productivity recruiting and retention as well as changes in 

  

index to financial statements direct response strategy all of which has contributed to lower new sales during 2006 am best downgraded torchmark’s funded debt one notch from a to a and its preferred stock from a to bbb moody’s downgraded our funded debt from a3 to baa1 and our preferred stock from baa1 to baa2 both downgrades were to reflect the “notching” or widening of rating levels between the insurance companies and their parent company which has issued the debt this notching is typical for these rating agencies as they rate other insurance companies it does not reflect any change in the creditworthiness of the company the chart below presents torchmark’s credit ratings as of december 31 2007 

  

   

the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries are also rated by standard  poor’s and am best in 2007 standard  poor’s lowered its financial strength rating of united investors to a from a and the ratings of liberty globe united american and american income from aa to aa as a result of an expected lag in new business sales in the short term in 2006 a m best lowered its financial strength rating of united investors to a excellent from a superior as a result of torchmark’s diminished emphasis of that subsidiary’s business the following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2007 

  

   

am best states that it assigns a superior ratings to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time the am best a excellent rating is assigned to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated excellent overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a excellent companies have an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 

  

the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard  poor’s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics differing only slightly from those rated higher the minus sign  shows the relative standing within the major rating category the a rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined additionally it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation based upon information 

  

index to financial statements presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 14 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

new unadopted accounting rules 

  

the fasb has issued certain new standards applicable to torchmark effective in future periods 

  

fair value measurements   statement no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 clarifies the definition of fair value establishes a single framework or a hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements it does not change which assets or liabilities are measured at fair value accordingly it is not expected to have a significant impact on torchmark’s financial position however new disclosures of fair value measurement methodology and effects will be required the statement is effective for torchmark in the calendar year and interim periods of 2008 with its provisions applied prospectively please refer to the discussion of valuation of fixed maturities under the caption critical accounting policies in this report for more information related to this new unadopted statement 

  

fair value option statement no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 159 was issued in february 2007 this statement permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value which are otherwise measured on a different basis in existing literature additional disclosures are required if elected it is effective as of january 1 2008 

  

this statement would provide us with the opportunity to carry our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt as well as our invested assets at market value with changes reflected in earnings the size of this unrealized adjustment to earnings in relation to net income each period could be considerable and very volatile causing our earnings not to be reflective of core results historical patterns or predictive of future earnings trends therefore we will not elect to adopt this statement 

  

business combinations   statement no 141r business combinations sfas 141r replaces the previous accounting guidance for the acquisition of other companies it retains the purchase method of accounting and the current guidance with respect to the accounting for indefinitelived intangibles and goodwill however the new statement provides certain significant differences most notably that all assets and liabilities including contingent liabilities are measured at their fair value as of the acquisition date rather than a cost allocation approach as previously required additionally all expenses of the acquisition are charged off as incurred rather than capitalized this statement is effective for torchmark as of january 1 2009 in the event there is an acquisition dated subsequent to that date 

noncontrolling interests   statement no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 51 sfas 160 changes the accounting for noncontrolling interests also known as minority interests at this time torchmark has no noncontrolling interests 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note 5 — future policy benefit reserves  

  

index to financial statements approximately 68 of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december 31 2007 are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 60 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas 60 under which the liability is the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue under sfas 60 these assumptions are “locked in” and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts except where there is a premium deficiency as defined in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits otherwise variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies a premium deficiency event for torchmark’s sfas 60 business is very rare and did not occur during the three years ended december 31 2007 

  

the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business reported under statement of financial accounting standards no 97 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain longduration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments sfas 97 under sfas 97 the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date accordingly there are no assumptions used in the determination of the sfas 97 future policy benefit liability 

  

deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales additionally the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption “value of insurance purchased” as indicated in note 4 — deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to consolidated financial statements our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

approximately 94 of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december 31 2007 are accounted for under the provisions of sfas 60 for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the premiumpaying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums the projection assumptions for sfas 60 business are set at the time of contract issue under sfas 60 these assumptions are “lockedin” at that time and except where there is a loss recognition issue are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts absent a premium deficiency variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for our sfas 60 assets for any period in the three years ended december 31 2007 

  

the remaining portion of deferred acquisition costs pertain to business reported under sfas 97 for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits these contracts are not subject to lockin under sfas 97 the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised for the three years ended december 31 2007 revisions related to our sfas 97 assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and based on the nature of our operations are not expected to have a material impact on operations for the foreseeable future 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other 

  

index to financial statements benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation at this time we do not expect any change in estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 

  

revenue recognition premium income from our subsidiaries’ insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected however in accordance with gaap revenue on limitedpayment contracts and universal lifetype contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently revenues on limitedpayment contracts are recognized over the contract period premium for deposit balance products such as our annuity and interestsensitive life policies is added to the policy account value the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance administration surrender and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder in each case benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 

  

we report investment income as revenue less investment expenses when it is earned our investment activities are integral to our insurance operations because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates contract liabilities and other product contract features these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on our net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in our insurance and annuity products for more information concerning revenue recognition investment accounting and interest sensitivity please refer to note 1 — significant accounting policies and note 3 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities investments and market risk sensitivity in this report 

  

valuation of fixed maturities we hold a substantial investment in highquality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time primarily to maintain our investment quality and diversification standards we report this portfolio at fair value fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets having a greater impact on longerterm maturities because of the size of our fixedmaturity portfolio small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company this impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report however as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and as such we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 

  

the fair value of approximately 16 of our fixedmaturity portfolio is established by quoted prices for these assets in an active market considered level 1 inputs in the hierarchy described by the recently issued but unadopted sfas 157 the fair value of approximately 952 of the portfolio is determined by observable inputs other than direct quotes considered as level 2 inputs by sfas 157 these inputs generally include quoted closing market prices for similar assets in active markets such quotes in inactive markets or interest rates and yield curves observable under commonly quoted criteria the remaining 32 of the portfolio is valued by unobservable inputs or level 3 inputs in accordance with sfas 157 unobservable inputs include data for which there is limited market information causing us to rely on values derived by independent brokers or internallydeveloped assumptions these values are established based on the best information available to us or the other parties 

  

impairment of investments we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value whereby fair value has declined below carrying value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies and 

  

index to financial statements note 3 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans at december 31 2007 our net liability under these plans was 54 million 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot assure that actual results will be the same as expected our discount rate rate of return on assets and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in note 9 — postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to us note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies and other related data

index to financial statements management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management at torchmark corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis as a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting the company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls accordingly even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time 

  

management evaluated the company’s internal control over financial reporting and based on its assessment determined that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2007 the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of torchmark corporation and subsidiaries “torchmark” as of december 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion torchmark maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2007 of torchmark and our report dated february 28 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

health insurance 

  

torchmark offers supplemental limitedbenefit health insurance products that include hospitalsurgical plans cancer and accident plans sold to individuals under age 65 these policies are designed to supplement health coverage that applicants already own or to provide affordable limitedbenefit coverage to individuals without access to more comprehensive coverage medicare supplements are also offered to enrollees in the traditional feeforservice medicare program all medicare supplement plans are standardized by federal regulation and are designed to pay deductibles and copayments not paid by medicare we also began offering medicare part d prescription drug insurance in 2006

the following table presents supplemental health annualized premium in force for the three years ended december 31 2006 by marketing distribution method 

  

   

annuities 

  

annuity products offered include singlepremium deferred annuities flexiblepremium deferred annuities and variable annuities in recent years torchmark has deemphasized the marketing of annuity products and annuities in 2006 comprise less than 1 of premium income and less than 2 of insurance underwriting margin 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses all of which are generally based on company experience and on projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

  

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each company uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

  

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis a list of the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in the financial statements  see note 5 — future policy benefit reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

  

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws that generally permit investments in qualified municipal state and federal government obligations corporate bonds preferred and common stock real estate and mortgages where the value of the underlying real estate exceeds the amount of the loan the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities fixed maturities represented 94 of total investments at december 31 2006  see note 3 — investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis  

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in alabama delaware indiana missouri new york and texas 

  

insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory approval for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions 

  

personnel 

  

at the end of 2006 torchmark had 2495 employees and 1263 licensed employees under sales contracts 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a mature regulated industry populated by many firms torchmark operates in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

  

the life insurance industry is highly competitive and could limit torchmark’s ability to gain or maintain market share competition by product price and for market share is generally strong in the life insurance industry but is less so in torchmark’s life insurance niche markets in recent years most life insurers have targeted the smaller highly competitive higherincome market by offering asset accumulation products torchmark’s market has remained the middle income market offering individuallysold protection life insurance which is less competitive because the market is larger with fewer competing insurers and with less price sensitivity than the higher income asset accumulation marketplace 

  

torchmark’s life insurance markets are subject to risks of general economic conditions   because torchmark serves the middle income market for individual protection life insurance competition is primarily from alternative uses of the customer’s disposable income in times of economic downturns that affect employment levels potential customers may be less likely to buy policies and policyholders may fail to pay premiums 

  

torchmark’s life products are sold in selected niche markets the company is at risk should any of these markets diminish torchmark has two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches labor union members and sales via direct response distribution the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales in recent years labor union membership has grown little and has declined as a percentage of employed workers however torchmark’s unionmember policyholders are still a small portion of total union membership indicating that sales growth can continue for some time without growth in total union membership most of the company’s direct response business is either through direct mail solicitation or inserted into other mail media for distribution significant adverse changes in postage cost or the acceptance of unsolicited marketing mail by consumers could negatively affect this business 

  

the development and maintenance of torchmark’s various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales because the company’s life insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market the development maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market are critical for agents adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates them to increase sales is very important in direct response continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies will in time lead to less than optimum growth in sales and ultimately in profits 

  

health insurance marketplace risk 

  

congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact torchmark’s medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug insurance business medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of torchmark’s in force health insurance business because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program it is possible that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress in the future these changes could have either a positive or negative effect on that business in 2006 congress first provided prescription drug coverage medicare part d to medicare beneficiaries changes are likely to be made to the program over the next several years as the acceptance and costs of the program become clear some of these changes might adversely affect torchmark’s ability to profit from its sale or the level of risk involved 

  

torchmark’s medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers the medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior  aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional medicare such as health maintenance organizations hmos and other managed care or private plans the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance 

  

torchmark’s medicare supplement business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales in recent years price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market has been significant characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to under price new sales in order to gain market share torchmark believes these practices are not in the best interest of the company or consumers and has elected not to compete on those terms which has negatively affected sales should these industry practices continue it is likely that torchmark’s sales of this health product will remain depressed 

  

torchmark’s health business is at risk in the event of governmentsponsored underage65 health insurance currently torchmark’s leading health sales are from limited benefit products sold to people under age 65 these products are in demand when buyers are either self employed or their 

  

employers offer limited or no health insurance to employees if in the future the government offers comprehensive health care to people under age 65 demand for this product would likely decline given the high cost and political challenges of such a program torchmark believes this is a lowlevel risk in the foreseeable future 

  

general operating risk 

  

changes in mortality economic conditions or other market conditions could significantly affect our operation and profitability the company’s insurance contracts are affected by the levels of mortality morbidity persistency and healthcare utilization that we experience the resulting levels that occur may differ significantly from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set significant variations in these levels could negatively affect profit margins and income however the company’s actuaries continually test expected to actual results 

  

torchmark’s ability to pay dividends or service any of its debt or preferred securities is limited by the amounts its subsidiaries are able to pay to the holding company torchmark’s insurance company subsidiaries its principal sources of cash flow periodically declare and distribute dividends on their common and preferred stock held by torchmark the holding company torchmark’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock principal and interest on any debt security or dividends on any preferred stock security is affected by the ability of its subsidiaries to pay the holding company these dividends the insurance company subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to the holding company for example under certain state insurance laws an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations excluding capital gains and losses or 10 of statutory surplus without regulatory approval 

  

torchmark can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could under certain circumstances significantly reduce dividends or other amounts paid to torchmark by its subsidiaries additionally the inability to obtain approval of the previously mentioned premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact the profitability and thus the ability of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries to declare and distribute dividends 

  

a ratings downgrade could negatively affect torchmark’s ability to compete ratings are an important factor in torchmark’s competitive position rating organizations periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers including the company’s insurance subsidiaries while ratings are less important in the middleincome market than in markets focused on higher incomes or the group market a downgrade in the ratings of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the subsidiaries to market their products 

  

rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the considered factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to general economic conditions and circumstances outside of the company’s control 

  

investment risk 

  

the company’s investments are subject to market risks torchmark’s invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults downgrades and changes in market values factors that may affect these risks include interest rate levels financial market performance and general economic conditions as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses or industries of individual issuers some of these factors could result in writedowns of individual investments significant increases in interest rates could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of the fixed investment portfolio reflecting unrealized fair value losses this risk is mitigated by torchmark’s operating strategy to generally hold investments to maturity recognizing the longterm nature of the life policy reserve liabilities supported by investments and by torchmark’s strong operating cash flow that greatly diminishes the need to liquidate investments prior to maturity 

  

a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the rates credited to the net policy liabilities while torchmark attempts to manage its investments to preserve the excess investment income spread the company can give no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads 

  

significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in the company’s investment income as reinvestment of the proceeds would be at the prevailing lower rates 

  

regulatory risk 

  

regulatory changes could adversely affect our business insurance companies are subject to government regulation in each of the states in which they conduct business state agencies have broad administrative power over many aspects of the insurance business which may include premium rates marketing practices advertising licensing agents policy forms capital adequacy and permitted investments government regulators are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than our shareholders insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on its business furthermore the company cannot predict the timing or form of any future regulatory initiatives 

  

changes in taxation could negatively affect our income changes in the way the insurance industry is taxed or increases in tax rates could increase the company’s tax burden and negatively affect its income 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against the company or its subsidiaries a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark does business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states including alabama juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit torchmark like other insurers is involved in this type of litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty 

  

natural disaster risk 

  

torchmark’s business is subject to risk of a catastrophic event the marketplaces of torchmark’s major subsidiaries are national in scope because the company’s insurance policies in force are relatively lowface amounts issued to large numbers of policyholders the likelihood that a large portion of the company’s policyholder base would be affected by a natural disaster is not likely as a result it is unlikely that even a major natural disaster covering hundreds of miles would disrupt the marketing and premium collection in more than a small portion of torchmark’s markets in addition the administration of the four leading subsidiaries is conducted in three distant locations that allow the company to take advantage of those distances to plan backup administrative support for any one of the subsidiaries in the event of disaster the company also has outside contracts for offsite backup information systems and record keeping in the event of a disaster 

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

as of december 31 2006 torchmark had no unresolved staff comments 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

torchmark through its subsidiaries owns or leases buildings that are used in the normal course of business united american owns and occupies a 140000 square foot facility located in mckinney texas a north dallas suburb in 2006 torchmark’s headquarters were relocated from birmingham alabama to mckinney in conjunction with this move we are constructing a 150000 square foot building adjacent to the united american building the expected completion date of the new building is december 27 2007 

  

liberty owns a 487000 square foot building in birmingham alabama which currently serves as liberty’s and united investors’ home office approximately 134000 square feet of this building is leased or available for lease to unrelated tenants by liberty liberty also operates from 30 companyowned district offices used for agency sales personnel liberty is currently in the process of selling its remaining companyowned office buildings opting instead to operate from leased facilities in 2006 a total of 21 buildings were sold 

  

globe owns a 300000 square foot office building in oklahoma city oklahoma of which globe occupies 56000 square feet as its home office and the remaining space is either leased or available for lease globe also owns an 80000 square foot office building in oklahoma city further globe owns a 112000 square foot facility located in oklahoma city which houses the globe direct response operation

liberty and united american also lease district office space for their agency sales personnel 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

torchmark and its subsidiaries in common with the insurance industry in general are subject to litigation including claims involving tax matters alleged breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmark’s subsidiaries employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on torchmark’s financial condition future operating results or liquidity however assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forwardlooking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges juries and appellate courts in the future this bespeaks caution particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as alabama and mississippi 

  

many of these lawsuits involve claims for punitive damages in state courts of alabama and mississippi torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards continue to occur bearing little or no relation to actual damages awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark has substantial business particularly alabama and mississippi creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit as of december 31 2006 liberty was a party to approximately 42 active lawsuits which included no employmentrelated cases and excluded interpleaders 29 of which were alabama proceedings and 1 of which was a mississippi proceeding in which punitive damages were sought 

  

as previously reported in forms 10k and 10q liberty national life insurance company and torchmark corporation were parties to purported class action litigation filed in the circuit court of choctaw county alabama on behalf of all persons who currently or in the past were insured under 

  

liberty cancer policies which were no longer being marketed regardless of whether the policies remained in force or lapsed  roberts v liberty national life insurance company  case no cv2002009b these cases were based on allegations of breach of contract in the implementation of premium rate increases misrepresentation regarding the premium rate increases fraud and suppression concerning the closed block of business and unjust enrichment on december 30 2003 the alabama supreme court issued an opinion granting liberty’s and torchmark’s petition for a writ of mandamus concluding that the choctaw circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction and ordering that circuit court to dismiss the action the plaintiffs then filed their purported class action litigation against liberty and torchmark in the circuit court of barbour county alabama on december 30 2003  roberts v liberty national life insurance company  civil action no cv030137 on april 16 2004 the parties filed a written stipulation of agreement of compromise and settlement with the barbour county alabama circuit court seeking potential settlement of the roberts case a fairness hearing on the potential settlement was held by the barbour county circuit court on july 15 2004 after receipt of briefs on certain issues and submission of materials relating to objections to the proposed settlement to the courtappointed independent special master the court reconvened the previouslycontinued fairness hearing on september 23 2004 after the september 23 2004 hearing the court after hearing from the objectors to the potential settlement ordered the appointment of an independent actuary to report back to the court on certain issues the report of the independent actuary was subsequently furnished to the special master and the court on a timely basis 

  

on november 22 2004 the court entered an order and final judgment in roberts whereby the court consolidated roberts with robertson v liberty national life insurance company  cv92021 previously reported in forms 10k and 10q for purposes of the roberts stipulation of settlement and certified the roberts class as a new subclass of the class previously certified by that court in robertson  the court approved the stipulation and settlement and ordered and enjoined liberty to perform its obligations under the stipulation subject to the stipulation liberty and torchmark were permanently enjoined from instituting engaging or participating in maintaining authorizing or continuing premium rate increases inconsistent with the stipulation failing to implement temporary premium waivers in accordance with the stipulation failing to implement the new benefits procedure described in the stipulation and failing to implement the special schedules and special provisions of the stipulation for subclass members who have cancer and are receiving benefits and for subclass members who have no other cancer or medical insurance andor are not covered by medicare the court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims released the defendants enjoined roberts subclass members from any further prosecution of released claims and retained continuing jurisdiction of all matters relating to the roberts settlement in an order issued february 1 2005 the court denied the objectors’ motion to alter amend or vacate its earlier final judgment on class settlement and certification the companies proceeded to implement the settlement terms on march 10 2005 the roberts plaintiffs filed notice of appeal to the alabama supreme court 

  

in an opinion issued on september 29 2006 the alabama supreme court voided the barbour county circuit court’s final judgment and dismissed the roberts appeal the supreme court held that the barbour county court lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction in roberts to certify the roberts class as a subclass of the robertson class and to enter a final judgment approving the settlement since roberts was filed as an independent class action collaterally attacking robertson rather than being filed in robertson under the barbour county court’s reserved continuing jurisdiction over that case on october 23 2006 liberty filed a petition with the barbour county circuit court under its continuing jurisdiction in robertson for clarification or in the alternative to amend the robertson final judgment liberty seeks an order from the circuit court declaring that liberty pay benefits to robertson class members based upon the amounts accepted by providers in full payment of charges a hearing will be held on liberty’s petition on march 13 2007

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and to a limited extent annuities to middle income households throughout the united states we view our operations by segments which are the major insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully described in note 13 — business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and benefit administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs and commissions 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is 

  

net investment income 

less 

interest credited to net policy liabilities 

financing costs 

  

the tables in note 13 — business segments reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ending december 31 2006 additionally this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates yeartoyear comparability and which reconciles to net income that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations net income increased 5 or 23 million to 519 million in 2006 and 6 or 27 million to 495 million in 2005 the primary contributor to growth in 2006 earnings was the health insurance segment as we first offered medicare part d for coverage beginning january 1 2006 our medicare part d product accounted for 26 million of the 30 million growth in health margins the life insurance segment also added 16 million to our 28 million growth in pretax earnings in 2006 the 19 million growth in 2005 earnings came primarily from the life insurance segment as it accounted for 29 million of pretax earnings growth excess investment income declined in both years as it continues to be compressed by a flattened yield curve and as increasing amounts of cash are used to repurchase torchmark shares 

  

life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december 31 2006 rising 4 in 2006 to 15 billion and 5 in 2005 margins as a percentage of premium have also increased slightly each year from 25 of premium in 2004 to 26 in 2005 and 2006 the combination of premium and margin percentage growth has resulted in increases in the total life contribution to pretax earnings mentioned above however sales volumes have declined slightly each year life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption life insurance 

  

health premium rose 22 or 223 million to 12 billion in 2006 but 212 million of the growth came from medicare part d premium health premium declined 3 in 2005 medicare supplement accounts for the largest portion of our health premium over the past few years increased competition in the medicare supplement business has continued to dampen health sales and has resulted in declines in the premium from this product each year however net sales of our underage65 limitedbenefit health products have grown significantly over the past few years as demand for these products continues to increase see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

  

while we still offer annuities we do not plan to emphasize annuity products favoring life insurance instead see the caption annuities for further discussion 

  

the investment segment’s pretax profitability declined 2 in each of the last two years falling 5 million in 2006 and 6 million in 2005 growth in total investment income has been negatively affected by torchmark’s share repurchase program described later under this caption which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments management believes that the acquisition of torchmark stock at favorable prices provides a superior return on available cash additionally the low longterm interest rates available for new investments during the past three years have caused our average portfolio yield to decline in each successive year restricting growth in net investment income and excess investment income beginning in late 2004 and continuing through mid2006 excess investment income was further compressed as shortterm rates rose with no meaningful change in longterm rates the increase in shortterm rates caused shortterm financing costs to increase and the income spread on torchmark’s fixedtovariable interestrate swaps to narrow because of the diminished profitability of these swaps all of the swaps were disposed of by june 2006 see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments for a more detailed discussion 

  

during the second quarter of 2006 we issued two new debt securities in separate public offerings 1 our 71 trust preferred securities redemption amount 120 million and 2 our 6 3  8  senior notes par value 250 million these offerings essentially provided funding for the repayment of two existing debt instruments in the fourth quarter of 2006 1 the call of our 7¾ trust preferred securities at a redemption price of 150 million and 2 the maturity of our 6¼ senior notes par value 180 million more information on these transactions can be found in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 

  

total revenues rose 9 in 2006 to 342 billion in 2005 total revenues increased 2 to 313 billion from 307 billion in 2004 the 2006 revenue increase was primarily the result of the 212 million of premium added from medicare part d growth in life premium and net investment income also contributed to 2006 revenue growth life premium was the greatest contributor to the 2005 revenue increase but net investment income was also a positive factor 

  

we had 7 million of aftertax realized investment losses in 2006 compared with an immaterial amount of aftertax realized investment gains in 2005 and gains of 14 million in 2004 realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and have a material positive or negative impact on net income under the caption realized gains and losses in this report we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses also as explained in note 13—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments 

  

in each of the years 2004 through 2006 net income was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring nonoperating items we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations a discussion of these items follows 

  

in 2006 we received four litigation and tax settlements two of which were concerned with issues related to a subsidiary and an investment disposed of several years ago a third involving our investment in worldcom inc bonds worldcom which was held and sold in prior years and a fourth concerning federal income tax issues arising from examinations of prior years the first settlement involving the disposed subsidiary resulted in state income tax refunds of 67 million net of expenses 43 million net of tax which were received and reported above as a tax settlement the second settlement involving the investment resulted in proceeds of 51 million net of expenses 33 million net of tax and is included in the table above as a legal settlement in the third settlement we received 63 million 41 million after tax in connection with our worldcom classaction litigation for recovery of a portion of investment losses this item is included in the table above as a litigation settlement the federal income tax settlement resulted in benefits due us of 74 million included as tax settlements in the table above the two litigation settlements were included in “other income” and the two tax settlements reduced “income taxes” in the 2006 consolidated statement of operations  all four of these cases involved litigation or issues arising years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations 

  

additionally in 2006 our subsidiary liberty national began a program to dispose of its agency office buildings replacing them with rental facilities in 2006 21 buildings were sold for gross proceeds of 67 million and a pretax gain of 48 million because of the significant scale of this nonoperating item we have removed 43 million 28 million after tax from our core results representing the gain from the sales we contemplate this program to continue into 2007 

  

in 2005 we recorded an aftertax charge of 955 thousand 15 million pretax pertaining to litigation this litigation involved net settlements after expenses primarily in three significant legal matters our subsidiary liberty national’s racedistinct mortalitydualpricing litigation its classaction cancer case and the waddell  reed litigation all of the settlements of these cases relate to litigation arising many years ago and are not relevant to current operations of this pretax amount 135 million is recorded as “other income” and 15 million is recorded as “other operating expense” in the 2005 consolidated statement of operations  for more information on these litigation items see note 14—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  also in 2005 we recorded a 16 million settlement benefit from an internal revenue service examination covering several years this tax settlement reduced tax expense more information on this tax settlement is provided in note 8—income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  additionally a noncash aftertax charge of 369 thousand was recorded as a result of the extension in the term of a previously granted stock option for a senior officer upon retirement the option extension expense was recorded as administrative expense in the 2005 consolidated statement of operations  

  

as of january 1 2004 torchmark adopted statement of position 031 sop 031  an accounting rule concerning guaranteed minimum policy benefits on variable annuities the adoption of this standard resulted in a onetime aftertax charge of 72 million recorded as a change in accounting principle also during 2004 we received a refund of state income taxes in the amount of 30 million after federal tax this refund resulted from the settlement of certain state tax issues concerning a discontinued operation in the mid1990s the refund reduced income tax expense in the 2004 consolidated statement of operations  

  

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 and was reaffirmed at its july 27 2006 board of director’s meeting with no specified authorization amount we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december 31 2006

throughout the remainder of this discussion share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow 

  

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows 

  

life insurance life insurance is our largest insurance segment with 2006 life premium representing 55 of total premium life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 65 of the total in 2006 additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

life insurance premium rose 4 to 152 billion in 2006 and 5 in 2005 to 147 billion life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium by channel for each of the last three years is as follows

we use four statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “annualized premium issued” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue annualized premium issued sold is that amount of annualized premium in force added from new sales in a given period and is an indicator of the acceleration of premium growth net sales is annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future annualized life premium in force was 162 billion at december 31 2006 an increase of 2 over 158 billion a year earlier annualized life premium in force was 152 billion at december 31 2004

direct response is our leading writer of life insurance marketing is conducted through direct mail but also through coop mailings television and consumer magazine advertising and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups unions and associations this distribution channel markets a line of life products primarily to juveniles their parents and other adults over age 50 the direct response operation accounted for 30 of our life insurance premium during 2006 the largest of any distribution group direct response’s share of total life premium has risen steadily in each of the last three years life premium for this channel rose 8 in 2006 and 10 in 2005 

  

this group’s focus is on its juvenile life product not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile insureds parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a solicitation by direct response for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both the juveniles and their parents are lowacquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time we expect that sales to the juvenile market and their parents will continue as one of this group’s premier markets we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance 

  

in january 2007 we acquired direct marketing and advertising distributors inc dmad an advertising and publication company which has supplied insert media and marketing services to our direct response operation for the past fifteen years we believe the acquisition should provide direct response with significant cost savings and potential increases in solicitation volume 

  

direct response net sales rose 2 in 2006 to 115 million and 1 in 2005 to 112 million firstyear collected premium grew 1 in 2006 to 77 million and rose 3 to 77 million in 2005 we believe that the dmad purchase will favorably impact direct response sales going forward 

  

the american income exclusive agency focuses on members of labor unions credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios life premium for this agency rose 8 to 409 million in 2006 after having increased 9 in 2005 net sales increased 2 in 2006 to 86 million from 84 million in 2005 net sales declined 4 in 2005 firstyear collected premium declined 2 in 2006 to 72 million after having decreased 4 in 2005 as in the case of all of torchmark’s agency distribution systems continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count growth in the agent count has contributed to the improvements in sales in this agency net sales a lead indicator of new sales rose after two years of declines additionally the decline in firstyear collected premium was reduced in 2006 the american income agent count was 2353 at december 31 2006 compared with 2027 a year earlier an increase of 16 the agent count declined 3 in 2005 from 2090 at year end 2004 this agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business additionally our systematic centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets its life products to primarily middleincome customers in southeastern states but has recently expanded into several other states liberty’s life premium declined slightly in both 2006 and 2005 compared with the respective prior year liberty’s life premium sales in terms of net sales were 41 million in 2006 representing a decrease of 12 in 2006 after having decreased 4 in 2005 firstyear collected premium declined 5 in 2006 to 34 million firstyear collected premium declined 9 in 2005 

  

growth in the liberty agency’s sales and premium volume are highly dependent on building the size of its agency force liberty had 1381 producing agents at year end 2006 compared with 1781 at year end 2005 a decline of 22 this decline was the primary factor in 2006 sales declines while the agent count in this agency rose 9 in 2005 it fell 15 in 2004 in 2006 the liberty national agency began the reorganization of its marketing leadership and restructured its agent compensation system to provide greater reward to productive agents and to establish production minimums for agents these changes led to terminations and resignations during 2006 of agents not meeting these production minimums however management believes that these changes will result in a more productive agency over the long term management also believes these changes will result in margin improvements also liberty has implemented initiatives similar to those of american income to recruit new agents primarily through the use of the internet as these agents become more seasoned they should become more productive the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems increased sales from a larger and more productive agency force should lead to increased premium growth 

  

our military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of wholelife products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates in 2006 life premium was 203 million or 13 of torchmark’s total life premium premium increased 2 in 2006 from 199 million premium rose 7 in 2005 this agency has broadened its portfolio to provide a much more comprehensive selection of other products nontorchmark it has reduced commission rates on nontorchmark investment products and as a result lost 30 of the producing agents appointed with torchmark in 2005 and lost an additional 24 of agents in 2006 while this agency recently broadened its target market to include nonmilitary customers sales in this agency have fallen sharply military agency net sales declined 32 in 2006 to 12 million after having declined 37 in 2005 to 18 million firstyear collected premium declined 35 in 2006 to 14 million after a 2005 decline of 20 margins in the military group improved in 2006 as a result of the decline in mortality in 2005 and 2004 margins were negatively affected by hostilities in the middle east resulting in higher than expected benefits paid of 39 million in 2005 and 40 million in 2004 benefits paid for these hostilities in 2006 were 25 million 

  

we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the united investors agency the united american independent and branch office agencies and other small miscellaneous sales agencies the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business united investors represents approximately 5 of torchmark’s life premium income the united american independent and branch office agencies combined represented approximately 4 of torchmark’s total life premium life premium income and sales for these two agencies has declined for the past three years because they focus on health insurance with life sales being incidental

gross margins as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense rose 4 in 2006 to 397 million after rising 8 in 2005 and 9 in 2004 as a percentage of life insurance premium gross margins have increased slightly each year improvements in life margins have resulted from several factors the previouslymentioned changes in liberty’s agent compensation system has contributed to increases in liberty’s margins as this system has reduced acquisition costs at liberty additionally the proportion of american income premium to total premium has grown each year and that has caused life margins to increase because that agency’s margins are torchmark’s highest well exceeding 30 in 2006 mortality improvement in the military agency noted above was also a major factor 

  

health insurance health products sold by torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limited benefit hospitalsurgical plans cancer and accident plans sold to people under age 65 we also sell medicare supplements to enrollees in the federal medicare program as well as providing coverage under the medicare part d prescription drug program after january 1 2006 because medicare part d is a significant new health product and there is no comparative prior year data medicare part d business will be shown as a separate health component and will be discussed separately in the analysis of the health segment health premium represented 44 of torchmark’s total premium income in 2006 excluding part d premium health premium represented 40 in 2006 compared with 40 in 2005 and 42 in 2004 health underwriting margin accounted for 31 of the total in both 2006 and 2005 excluding part d in 2006 compared with 32 in 2004 these declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years

we market supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels with the two united american agencies being our market leaders over the past several years we have placed greater emphasis on the sale of limitedbenefit health insurance products rather than medicare supplement insurance as customer demand for the limited benefit hospitalsurgical plans has increased and price competition and lesser demand for medicare supplements has dampened sales of that product while medicare supplement still remains our largest health product in terms of premium income the 

  

premium from other limitedbenefit health products have been growing rapidly as shown in the chart above medicare supplement premium represented 54 of total health premium excluding part d in 2006 but has declined steadily as a percentage of total health premium in each successive year accordingly limitedbenefit health products have increased as a percentage of total health premium before part d each year during the same period

the united american branch office and independent agencies as discussed above the two united american agencies have emphasized sales of individual supplemental limitedbenefit health plans known generally as hospitalsurgical plans for which demand has increased in recent years these plans generally provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined a fixedamount surgical schedule out patient coverage and other miscellaneous hospitalrelated charges they also contain caps on total perillness benefits consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual majormedical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limitedbenefit plans are generally lower than those of medicare supplement however the medicare supplement product has historically had slightly higher persistency rates resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium both of the united american agencies offer these limitedbenefit plans 

  

the united american branch office is an exclusive agency meaning the agents in its 125 offices nationwide sell only for us in recent years this agency has been successful in building sales of limitedbenefit plans to replace the decline in medicare supplement sales net sales of limitedbenefit plans in 2006 were 147 million an 88 increase net sales in 2005 were 78 million a 26 increase over 2004 

  

as a result total health sales at the ua branch office were 159 million a 66 increase over 2005 including the decline in medicare supplement sales premium from limitedbenefit plans at the ua branch office increased by 63 to 154 million in 2006 compared with 2005 and total health premium grew 10 to 355 million after taking the decline in the medicare supplement in force block into account premium in 2004 and 2005 remained relatively unchanged at 323 million at year end 2006 the ua branch office had 3015 producing agents compared with 2166 at year end 2005 a 39 increase this agency had 1677 agents at year end 2004 as is the case with all of our captive agencies growing the agency size translates into increased sales and premium growth 

  

the united american independent agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large multistate organizations down to oneperson offices all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies of which 3491 were active producing agents for torchmark at december 31 2006 health premium for the ua independent agency declined 5 to 419 million in 2006 after declining 6 in 2005 the declines in premium are due to the decreases in medicare supplement premium this block of business continues to decline as sales have not compensated for lapses this agency’s contribution to torchmark’s total health sales and premium has declined in each of the past three years however limitedbenefit premium has risen each year in this agency and was 24 of agency premium in 2006 compared with 22 in 2005 and 21 in 2004 even though net sales of limitedbenefit products declined in each of the last three years each year’s new sales have added to premium in force resulting in the increases in limitedbenefit premium in the recent past most of this agency’s health sales came from one large independent agency in 2005 that leading agency’s recruiting and training program experienced a disruption that resulted in a decline in producing agents the disruption resulted in a 32 drop in 2005 net sales sales from this agency did not recover in 2006 

  

liberty national exclusive agency  predominately a life insurance distribution channel is the third largest writer of torchmark health business based on premium collected cancer supplemental plans are the type of limitedbenefit health products primarily produced by this agency liberty is our only distribution channel for which cancer insurance is its primary health product liberty’s health premium declined 3 in 2006 to 145 million after a 9 drop in 2005 the declines in both years were the result of the settlement of a classaction lawsuit in early 2005 concerning a closed block of cancer business over the timing and size of the premium rate increases on this block this block represented approximately half of liberty’s cancer business in 2005 and approximately 37 at year end 2006 prior to 2005 significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on this block were a continuing factor causing growth in health premium but increasing claims continued to reduce underwriting margins the settlement provided for claims incurred after the effective date of the settlement in march 2005 to be paid on an actual incurred basis rather than a billed basis which reduced benefits paid going forward the settlement further required liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an 85 claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business prior to the settlement liberty had a claims loss ratio above 100 on this block 

  

net health sales in the liberty agency for 2006 declined 13 to 12 million compared with 2005 net health sales of 14 million net health sales were 13 million in 2004 the declines in agent counts discussed above are the major cause of these fluctuations as well as increased emphasis on selling the highermargin life products 

  

american income exclusive agency also predominately a life insurance distribution channel is our fourth largest health insurance distributor based on 2006 premium collected its health plans are comprised of various limitedbenefit plans for which almost two thirds of the agency’s 2006 health premium was from accident policies sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 

  

health premium at this agency for 2006 increased 6 to 67 million while 2005 premium of 64 million increased 7 over 2004 net health sales of 12 million in 2006 rose 3 over 2005 sales but 2005 net sales declined 6 net health sales comprised only 12 of the american income agency’s total net sales in 2006 

  

direct response  primarily a life operation also offers health insurance which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups in 2006 net health sales 

  

were 5 million comprising only 4 of direct response’s total life and health net sales these net sales declined 10 in 2006 net health sales declined 12 in 2005 to 6 million health premium in 2006 for this group rose 5 to 40 million health premium in 2005 was 38 million a 9 increase compared with 35 million in 2004 

  

medicare part d in 2005 united american contracted with centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to be an insurer under the government’s new medicare part d standalone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries unlike the traditional medicare program for hospital and doctor services where cms is the primary insurer and private medicare supplement insurers like united american are secondary insurers insurers participating in part d are the primary insurers for plans regulated and funded in part by cms the program generally calls for cms to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium total medicare part d premium was 212 million in 2006 at november 2006 united american still had 190 thousand enrollees in the 2006 part d plan for the 2007 plan we enrolled an additional 17 thousand but 25 thousand of the 2006 enrollees left our plan enrollment for 2007 coverage ended december 31 2006 our medicare part d product is sold primarily through the direct response operation but is also sold by the two ua agencies 

  

we believe that the medicare part d program is an excellent addition to our health product offerings because of our experience with the seniorage market and with medicare supplements the government assurances with regard to the risksharing agreements for participating insurers the incremental income added to our health insurance margins and the renewal of the business every year our experience with service to the seniorage market and use of our direct response marketing system required little new investment to enter this business as previously mentioned we view the medicare part d product separately from our other health products because of its significance and because there are no prior year comparisons 

  

we do not expect significant growth in the part d product in the near future as most medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a plan in 2006 additionally as with any governmentsponsored program the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market

torchmark’s health insurance underwriting margin excluding part d before other income and administrative expense increased 2 in 2006 from 177 million to 181 million in 2005 margin rose 1 even though there was a 3 decline in premium as a percentage of premium underwriting margin increased from 175 in 2005 to 177 in 2006 after having risen from 166 in 2004 these increases were largely the result of the reduced loss ratios in the previouslymentioned closed block of cancer business at liberty and improvements in american income’s loss ratios especially in 2006 liberty’s health margins increased 7 million or 36 in 2005 or 17 of health premium they rose another 3 million to 29 million in 2006 representing 20 of premium american income’s margins rose 3 million to 24 million in 2006 36 of premium 

  

annuities fixed and variable annuity products are sold on a limited basis by our subsidiaries annuities represented 1 of torchmark’s 2006 premium revenue and less than 2 of insurance underwriting margin we no longer emphasize this segment

annuities generate earnings from periodic policy fees and charges based on the average account balances reduced by net policy obligations and acquisition costs for fixed annuities net required interest on reserves is the required interest credited to the accounts and is offset by investment income 

  

for all three periods shown in the chart above account balances declined which resulted in reductions in policy fees and charges policy obligations also declined in each period as a result insurance underwriting margin for annuities before other income and administrative expenses declined in each period and was 119 million in 2006 as a percentage of policy charges margins improved each year over the prior year margins in 2006 were benefited by a decline in guaranteed minimum policy benefits to 7 million from 23 million in 2005 as a result of an increase in equity markets in 2006 equity markets were somewhat stable in 2005 in all three periods investment income earned exceeded required interest credited to fixed accounts a significant portion of annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements this spread results in negative net policy obligations 

  

administrative expenses operating expenses are included in the other and corporate segments and are classified into two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company the following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2006 included in the table is a reconciliation of operating expenses per the segment analysis to “other operating expenses” per the consolidated statements of operations

as noted in the summary of operations in this discussion we do not consider the costs of settling certain significant litigation in 2005 applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations also as stated in note 13—business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 

  

insurance administrative expenses as a percentage of premium declined to 56 in 2006 from 59 in 2005 after having increased from 57 in 2004 the decline in the 2006 ratio occurred even after including 5 million of medicare part d direct administrative expense for the first time in 2006 decreased legal costs were a primary factor as several ongoing issues were resolved in 2005 and 2006 the 2005 increase was primarily due to a 13 million payroll tax charge related to the option exercise and restoration program incurred in 2005 which program is discussed under the caption capital resources in this report 

  

investments excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  

    

the investment segment is responsible for the management of capital resources including investments debt and cash flow excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 1 3— business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing its share repurchase program in 1986 we have used 31 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

excess investment income declined 2 in 2006 to 319 million from 324 million in 2005 it also declined 2 in 2005 but rose 4 in 2004 on a per diluted share basis 2006 excess investment income rose 3 to 315 however per share excess investment income increased 4 in 2005 and 7 in 2004 growth in excess investment income is impacted by increases in investment income due to the growth in the portfolio and changes in rates available in financial markets it is also affected by crediting rates on policy liabilities and changes in our borrowing costs additionally share purchases in recent periods have caused excess investment income per share to grow faster than excess investment income 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income which rose 4 to 628 million in 2006 it rose 5 to 603 million in 2005 from 577 million in 2004 as presented in the following chart the growth in net investment income in both periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets 

  

   

the lower growth in income is reflective of new investments made each year at longterm yields lower than the portfolio’s average yield resulting from the lower rates available in financial markets in recent years also contributing to the lower growth in yields in recent years were calls on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio as the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities given the sizeable annual cash flow from our operations we expect mean invested assets to continue to grow but as long as rates available for new investments do not exceed our portfolio yield the rate of growth of investment income will be under pressure more detailed information about investment acquisitions follows under this caption 

  

excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 

  

interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

excess investment income was positively affected by reduced crediting rates on certain policy liabilities in 2004 accordingly the growth in interest credited to policy liabilities was not as great as the growth in the liabilities as we were able to respond to the lowinterest environment with reduced crediting rates on fixed annuities and certain life products while annuity crediting rates were reduced in 2005 we were not able to further reduce life and health crediting rates in 2005 nor any crediting rates in 2006 for more information on life and health crediting rates please refer to note 5—future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs

the table below presents the components of financing costs 

  

analysis of financing costs 

amounts in thousands 

  

   

financing costs increased 36 or 19 million in 2006 they rose 62 or 20 million in 2005 the increases in financing costs were caused by increased shortterm rates in financial markets which impacted us in several ways most notable was the effect that rising short rates had on our interest rate swaps which we originally entered into to exchange our fixedinterest commitments for floatingrate commitments in the lowinterest environment experienced in the past several years these swaps provided us with a considerable spread between our actual interest cost and what our fixed interest cost would have been in late 2004 a profitable tenyear swap expired we earned 98 million in 2004 from this swap one major factor in the 2005 increase in financing costs in 2004 shortterm rates began to rise for the next two years resulting in significant declines in the benefit of all of our other swaps because of the possibility that continued rising shortterm rates could cause our spreads to become negative we disposed of all swap instruments as of the second quarter of 2006 nevertheless the reductions in positive spreads on settlements from all swaps caused financing costs to increase 7 million in 2006 and 16 million in 2005 over the prior periods as a result of the dispositions of the swaps our only exposure to variable rates at december 31 2006 was our commercial paper borrowing program of which 170 million was outstanding 

  

in addition to their impact on our swaps rising shortterm rates were also the primary factor in increased interest on our commercial paper borrowings 1 million in 2006 and 4 million in 2005 another major factor in the increase in financing costs in 2006 was the refinancing of two funded debt issues our 6¼ senior notes 180 million principal amount matured in the fourth quarter of 2006 our 7 3  4  

  

trust preferred securities 150 million redemption value became callable also in the fourth quarter of 2006 and we elected to call them these repayments were essentially funded by the issuance of two new instruments in the second quarter of 2006 our 6 3  8  senior notes 250 million principal amount and our 71 trust preferred securities 120 million principal amount because the new issues were offered several months before the other securities were repaid interest on funded debt increased 11 million it should be noted however that we invested the proceeds of the new offerings and the investment income from those proceeds offset the increased financing costs having little impact on total excess investment income more information concerning the debt offerings repayments and swaps is disclosed in note 1 0— debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

our primary investment goal is to maintain a positive spread between the yield on investments and the yield on our interestbearing policy liabilities and debt it is this positive spread that results in excess investment income at the same time we seek investments predominately in publiclytraded investmentgrade corporate fixed income securities in periods of lower longterm rates achieving our goal becomes more challenging 

  

when yields available on highquality longterm over 20 years securities are sufficient to meet our yield and spread objectives we generally prefer to invest in longerterm securities which also more closely match the longterm nature of our policy liabilities however we do not want to invest for long durations at rates less than our minimum yield target therefore during periods when we cannot obtain our minimum target yield we will invest shorterterm at year end 2006 our current minimum target yield was about 65 in the last several years of a lower interestrate environment there have been periods when yields on acceptable securities have been below our minimum target yield and we have invested shorter term these periods have also been characterized by a flat or inverted yield curve with shortterm rates about the same as longterm rates in these periods we could obtain yields that were equivalent to long rates without the greater credit risks of longterm securities we were also provided with an earlier opportunity to reinvest the proceeds at higher rates at maturity 

  

prior to early 2005 we addressed the new lowerinterest rate environment by lengthening the maturities of new investment purchases to maximize the yield at that time there was still a significant spread of longterm yields over shortterm even though yields on new longterm investments began to decline however shortterm rates began to rise in late 2004 and continued to do so throughout 2005 and early into 2006 without a significant change in longterm rates resulting in a flattened yield curve at that time we implemented our alternative strategy to invest shorterterm when the available longterm yield fell below our minimum target yield as described above in mid2006 longterm rates rose slightly allowing us to invest at or above our minimum target yield while buying longterm securities 

  

the lower longterm yields accompanied by higher shortterm yields experienced during the past two years have had a considerable restricting effect on excess investment income causing it to decline in each of the past two years from the prior year however in the event of an increase in longterm rates excess investment income will benefit as new acquisitions can be made at higher yields even though shortterm rates could rise along with longterm rates higher longterm rates would be to torchmark’s advantage because the amount of cash invested annually significantly exceeds the amount of our floating rate debt and would result in greater investment income net of financing costs under most yield curve scenarios 

  

acquisitions  the chart below presents selected information about torchmark’s fixedmaturity acquisitions in the years 2004 through 2006 investmentgrade corporate securities include both bonds and trustpreferred securities classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors both yield and average life calculations on new purchases of noncallable bonds are based on the maturity date in the case of callable bonds the average life is based on the call date or maturity date whichever produces the lowest yield “yield to worst” 

  

fixed maturity acquisitions selected information

we continue to invest exclusively in investmentgrade fixed maturities as previously discussed we attempted to maximize yield on new investments in the lowinterest environment in 2004 and early 2005 by lengthening maturities our strategy changed in mid2005 through mid2006 to invest in shorter maturities and then changed back to longer maturities in the latter part of 2006 as a result the average life of new fixed maturity acquisitions was 234 years in 2004 falling to 153 years in 2005 and then rising to 209 years in 2006 the effective annual yield on new investments fluctuated accordingly at 647 in 2004 590 in 2005 and 672 in 2006 we believe that because of the longterm fixedrate characteristics of our policy liabilities even acquisitions with lives in excess of 20 years are appropriate for us when matching assets and liabilities 

  

new cash flow available to us for investment was affected by issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past three years issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they can refinance them at a lower cost calls increase funds available for investment but they negatively affect portfolio yield as they cause us to replace higheryielding bonds with those available at lower prevailing yields issuer calls were 229 million in 2006 226 million in 2005 and 352 million in 2004 

  

as long as the yields on new fixed maturity acquisitions remain below the overall portfolio yield the portfolio yield should slowly decline accordingly the portfolio yield has continued to decline in each successive year however in 2006 the effective annual yield on new acquisitions did turn up after several years of declines rising to 67 and having somewhat of a stabilizing effect on the downward trend of the portfolio yield as discussed above because of the sizeable annual cash flow generated from operations we believe torchmark will be well positioned if and when investment interest rates rebound 

  

portfolio analysis our emphasis has been on bond investments over alternative investments therefore the relative percentage of torchmark’s investments by type varies from industry norms the following table presents a comparison of torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2006 with the latest industry data

additional information concerning the fixedmaturity portfolio is as follows 

  

fixed maturity portfolio selected information 

  

     

at the end of 2006 and 2005 the fixedmaturity portfolio had a gross unrealized gain of 319 million and 486 million respectively gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities were 90 million at december 31 2006 compared with 61 million a year earlier please see note 3—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an analysis of unrealized investment losses 

  

credit risk sensitivity credit risk is the level of certainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity in weak economic periods the securities of industry sectors affected by the economic downturn suffer increased credit risk as a result securities in these weakened sectors could be downgraded by creditrating agencies to belowinvestment grade status thus the likelihood the issuers will honor their securities’ terms is reduced and the securities’ market values can be negatively impacted as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities credit risk is a concern we mitigate this ongoing risk in part by acquiring investmentgrade bonds and by investigating the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis at december 31 2006 approximately 94 of invested assets at fair value were held in fixedmaturity securities the major rating agencies considered 93 of this portfolio to be investment grade the average quality rating of the portfolio is a the table below demonstrates the credit rankings of torchmark’s fixedmaturity portfolio at fair value as of december 31 2006 

  

   

our current investment policy is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

we additionally reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors the following table presents the industry sectors that equaled or exceeded 2 of the corporate fixedmaturity portfolio at fair value at december 31 2006 

  

   

otherwise no individual industry represented 2 or more of torchmark’s corporate fixed maturities 

  

market risk sensitivity the primary market risk to which torchmark’s financial securities are exposed is interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since the portfolio is comprised 94 of fixedmaturity investments it is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates in recent years have generally resulted in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio however we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity our strategy would be the same should 

  

markets reverse and market rates increase placing the fixedincome portfolio in an unrealized loss position the longterm nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to declines in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however in accordance with gaap these liabilities are not marked to market 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2006 and 2005 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixedmaturity portfolio the data are prepared through a model which incorporates various assumptions and estimates to measure the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options put options and unscheduled repayments could have on the portfolio given the changes in rates the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 

  

   

realized gains and losses as a group of life and health insurance carriers we collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits we also incur acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

because our investment portfolio is large and diverse investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses occur only incidentally usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments we do not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which result from events that are beyond our control are only secondary to the core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders unlike investment income realized gains and losses are not considered in determining premium rates or product profitability of our insurance products 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations however and as a result have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause periodtoperiod trends of net income to not be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations for these reasons we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results 

  

the following table summarizes our taxeffected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2006

in 2004 we wrote down certain holdings to estimated fair value as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met some or all of our criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in note 3 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our critical accounting policies in this report the pretax charge for this impairment was 6 million a previously written down bond of 1 issuer was still held at december 31 2006 at a fair value of 26 million and a recorded book value of 10 million 

  

as discussed in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we redeemed our 7¾ trust preferred securities in 2006 recording a pretax loss of 55 million 36 million after tax additionally in 2006 we repurchased with the intent to retire 33 million principal amount of our 7 7  8  notes recording a pretax loss of 415 thousand 270 thousand after tax 

  

in prior years we have entered into interestrate swap agreements swapping our fixedrate commitments on our longterm debt for floatingrate commitments accounting rules require us to value our interestrate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period the fair values of these instruments fluctuate with interest rates in financial markets and diminish with the passage of time so that their value will be zero when they ultimately expire these periodtoperiod fluctuations can be substantial however we do not consider these periodtoperiod fluctuations in value in managing ongoing operations because their cumulative result will be zero if we elect to hold them to expiration these temporary unrealized changes in swap values are included as a component of “realized investment gains losses” in the consolidated statements of operations  this fair value adjustment for all swaps on an aftertax basis was a negative 3 million in 2006 compared with a negative 5 million in both 2005 and 2004 

  

in prior periods a steeper yield curve provided us with a considerable spread between long and shortterm rates on our interestrate swaps significantly reducing the interest cost of our longterm debt in recent periods however as shortterm rates have increased with no meaningful change in longterm rates these swaps have become less profitable because the outlook for shortterm rate increases in late 2005 and the expectation of even greater shortterm rate increases in 2006 could have caused these spreads to become unprofitable in the future we sold two of our swaps in the third quarter of 2005 and the remaining two swaps in the second quarter of 2006 the 2005 sales consisted of the 99 million notional amount related to the 825 senior debentures and the 100 million notional amount associated with the 7375 notes proceeds of 239 thousand were received on the sales the two remaining swaps sold in 2006 consisted of the 180 million notional amount related to the 6¼ senior notes and the 150 million notional amount in connection with the 7¾ trust preferred securities the 2006 sales resulted in net proceeds of 63 thousand no gain or loss was recorded at the time of the swap sales 

  

because the gains and losses were already reflected in the financial statements as a result of the periodic revaluation discussed above more information on our swaps is found in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

the securities and exchange commission’s accounting guidance currently requires that all income and expenses related to a nonhedged derivative be recorded in the same line item on the income statement that the adjustment to fair value is recorded therefore we combined the cash settlements on nonhedged swaps with the noncash unrealized fair value adjustment as a component of realized investment gains and losses additionally we included the cash settlements on hedged swap derivatives in realized investment gains and losses for consistency our pretax interest cost reduction from these cash settlements included in realized investment gains was a positive 491 thousand in 2006 a positive 7 million in 2005 and a positive 23 million in 2004 we reduced interest cost for this benefit in our segment analysis because the segment analysis is required by gaap to be as management evaluates the performance of the segment we view the benefit from lower interest rates as a reduction in financing costs in the investment segment 

  

financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations our liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

our insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs sources of cash flows from operations include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes 

  

operating cash inflows significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers such as torchmark expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods sometimes many years later a liability is actuarially computed and recorded for these future benefits which increases as insurance in force grows so that we can “save” for these future payments earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period but there is no corresponding cash outlay therefore cash provided from operations is generally expected to significantly exceed net income in any given period cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of the investment portfolio cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements available cash flows are also used to repay debt to buy back torchmark shares to pay shareholder dividends and for other corporate uses while our cash flows have historically been positive and very strong a material reduction in cash flow could negatively affect our liquidity 

  

cash flows provided from operations increased in each of the three years ended december 31 2006 over their respective prior year they were 869 million in 2006 857 million in 2005 and 767 million in 2004 in addition we received 606 million in investment maturities repayments and calls in 2006 adding to available cash flows such repayments were 473 million in 2005 and 574 million in 2004 

  

we have in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 600 million for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility see the commercial paper section of note 10 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

our cash and shortterm investments were 173 million at yearend 2006 and 138 million at yearend 2005 additionally we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 91 billion at december 31 2006 however our strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet dividend payments on common and preferred stock interest and principal repayment requirements on parentcompany debt and operating expenses of the parent company for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 11 — shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as fully described and discussed in note 10 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt torchmark had outstanding 120 million par amount 71 trust preferred securities at december 31 2006 and 150 million par amount 7 3  4  trust preferred securities a year earlier the capital trusts liable for these securities are the legal entities which are responsible for the securities and facilitate the payment of dividends to shareholders they are offbalance sheet arrangements which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules deconsolidation is required by accounting rules because they are considered to be variable interest entities in which we have no variable interest therefore torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity even though we own all of the entity’s voting equity and have guaranteed the entity’s performance while these liabilities are not on our balance sheet they are represented by torchmark’s 71 and 7 3  4  junior subordinated debentures due to the trusts these junior subordinated debentures were a torchmark liability of 124 million par and book value at december 31 2006 and 155 million par and book value at december 31 2005 these securities are 

  

indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption capital resources in this report the 71 preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our 71 interest payment on our debt to the trusts as described in note 14 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trusts to meet their financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 

  

pension obligations to our employees primarily are obligations of trust fund entities which are not reflected on our balance sheet the obligations of these trusts are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans these trust entities hold assets which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the pension obligations as they become due the difference in our pension obligations and the fair value of the assets which fund those obligations are included on our balance sheet as of december 31 2006 

  

during 2005 our subsidiary american income entered into an agreement to guarantee certain personal loans of american income employees and agents with first command bank first command bank is a subsidiary of first command financial services inc first command of which lamar c smith is chairman and ceo he is also a director of torchmark at december 31 2006 the balance subject to this guarantee was 71 thousand these guarantees are secured by vested commissions due the employees and agents see note 15—related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on this guarantee 

  

as of december 31 2006 we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of thirdparty entities other than as described above all of our guarantees other than the trust preferred guarantee and the first command bank guarantee were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 14 — commitments and contingencies all of our derivative instruments if any were recorded at fair value on our balance sheets

the carrying value of the funded debt was  721 million at december 31 2006 compared with 688 million a year earlier during the second quarter of 2006 we registered and issued two new security offerings our 71 trust preferred securities offered through torchmark capital trust iii at a redemption value of 120 million less issue expenses and our 6 3  8  senior notes issued for the principal amount of 250 million less issue expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006 we redeemed our 7 3  4  trust preferred securities and we repaid our 6 1  4  senior notes which matured the trust preferreds were redeemed for 150 million plus accrued dividends and our senior notes were repaid in the principal amount of 180 million plus accrued interest specific information about the new securities offered in 2006 including the uses of proceeds as well as information concerning securities repaid in 2006 including funding is disclosed and discussed in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

over the past several years we have entered into swap agreements to exchange the fixedrate commitments on our funded debt for floatingrate commitments during the low interestrate environment in recent years these swaps were very beneficial in reducing our interest cost as discussed under the captions investments excess investment income and realized gains and losses in this report as shortterm rates rose over the past two years with no meaningful change in longterm rates these swaps became less profitable because we believed that the swap settlements could have possibly turned negative we disposed of these agreements during the past two years and held no swap agreements as of december 31 2006 detailed information about the history of our swaps for the past three years is found in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption interest rate swaps  

  

in the second quarter of 2005 we executed a voluntary stock option exercise and restoration program in which 120 directors employees and consultants exercised vested options in torchmark’s common stock and received a lesser number of new options at the current market price as a result we issued 58 million new shares to the participants however a substantial number of the new shares were immediately sold through the open market by the participants to cover the option exercise price of their new shares and their related income taxes as a result of the program management’s ownership in torchmark increased and the company received a significant tax benefit from the exercise of the options we received 213 million in proceeds for the exercise price and 37 million in tax benefits both of which added to shareholder’s equity however as previously mentioned we generally use the proceeds of option exercises to repurchase shares on the open market to reduce the dilution caused by option exercises as a result the total impact on shareholder’s equity and cash flow from the transaction was immaterial more information on stock options and this program is found in note 1—significant accounting policies and in note 12—stockbased compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

as previously mentioned our board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the stock repurchase program in july 2006 in amounts and timing that management in consultation with the board determined to be in the best interest of the company we have repurchased common stock every year since 1986 except for 1995 the year following the acquisition of american income since the beginning of 1998 we have repurchased 46 million shares at a total cost of 19 billion and have acquired no fewer than 34 million shares in any one year we believe that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings return on equity and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value as noted earlier in this report we acquired 56 million shares at a cost of 320 million in 2006 with excess cash flow if the 320 million free cash flow used for the repurchase of our common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds an estimated 9 million of additional investment income after tax would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have increased 7 to 503 because share purchases were made actual net income per share was 513 an increase of 10 we intend to continue the repurchase of our common shares when prices are favorable 

  

we maintain a significant availableforsale fixedmaturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders’ liabilities accounting rule sfas 115 requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio result from changes in interest rates in financial markets while sfas 115 requires invested assets to be revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to its shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact in the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of our shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets for this reason our management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of sfas 115 when analyzing our balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of sfas 115 on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  

selected financial data 

  

      

torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 116 times in 2006 compared with 130 times in 2005 and 138 times in 2004 a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 

  

credit ratings the credit quality of torchmark’s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies during 2006 am best downgraded torchmark’s funded debt one notch from a to a and its preferred stock from a to bbb moody’s downgraded our funded debt from a3 to baa1 and our preferred stock from baa1 to baa2 both downgrades were to reflect the “notching” or widening of rating levels between the insurance companies and their parent company which has issued the debt this notching is typical for these rating agencies as they rate other insurance companies it does not reflect any change in the creditworthiness of the company the chart below presents torchmark’s credit ratings as of december 31 2006 

  

   

the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries are also rated by standard  poor’s and am best in 2006 a m best lowered its financial strength rating of united investors to a excellent from a superior as a result of torchmark’s diminished emphasis of that subsidiary’s business the following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2006 

  

   

am best states that it assigns a superior ratings to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time the am best a excellent rating is assigned to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated excellent overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a excellent companies have an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 

  

the aa rating is assigned by standard  poor’s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics differing only slightly from those rated higher the a rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings the “” indicates that united investors is among the strongest insurers within the a category

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined additionally it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in 

  

any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 14 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

new unadopted accounting rules 

  

the fasb has issued several new standards applicable to torchmark effective in future periods 

  

tax uncertainties   financial interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 was issued to clarify the accounting for income taxes by providing methodology for the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also requires additional disclosures and provides additional guidance on related topics it is effective for torchmark beginning january 1 2007 torchmark has substantially completed its assessment of the impact of the adoption of fin 48 and expects that the financial impact of the initial adoption if any will not be material 

  

hybrid financial instruments   statement no 155 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments sfas 155  extends the scope of statement no 133  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities   to include certain securitized financial assets these assets include primarily mortgagebacked securities collateralized mortgage obligations and assetbacked securities that contain an embedded derivative the company would have a onetime election to value the entire amount of any affected hybrid security at fair value with fluctuations in value included in earnings this statement is effective for torchmark as of january 1 2007 the effect of adoption of this statement will be immaterial for torchmark 

  

fair value measurements   statement no 157 fair value measurements  clarifies the definition of fair value establishes a framework or a hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements it does not require any new fair value measurements accordingly it is not expected to have a significant impact on torchmark’s financial position however new disclosures of fair value measurement methodology and effects will be required the statement is effective for torchmark in calendar year and interim periods of 2008 with its provisions applied prospectively 

  

fair value option statement no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  was issued in february 2007 this statement permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value which are otherwise measured on a different basis in existing literature additional disclosures are required it is effective for torchmark if elected as of january 1 2008 early adoption is permitted with several constraints torchmark is currently evaluating the impact of this statement 

  

internal replacements in september 2005 the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position 051 accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop 051 sop 051 provides accounting guidance for deferred policy acquisition costs associated with internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those already described in sfas no 97 “ accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain longduration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments ” sop 051 defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits features rights or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract or by amendment endorsement or rider to a contract or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract under sop 051 modifications that result in a substantially unchanged contract will be accounted for as a continuation of the replaced contract modifications to a replacement contract that substantially change the contract will be accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced contract resulting in a release of unamortized deferred acquisition cost unearned revenue and deferred sales inducements associated with the replaced contract the provisions of sop 051 are effective for torchmark for internal replacements occurring after december 31 2006 we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption at this time we do not expect sop 051 to have a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements while management and company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents our ultimate obligation additionally because of the size of this liability significantly different assumptions could have resulted in materially different reported amounts a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note 5 — future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales additionally the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption “value of insurance purchased” as indicated in note 4 — deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to consolidated financial statements our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements different assumptions with regard to deferred acquisition costs could produce materially different amounts of amortization for more information about accounting for deferred acquisition costs see note 4  

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation 

  

revenue recognition premium income from our subsidiaries’ insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected however in accordance with gaap revenue on limitedpayment contracts and universal lifetype contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently revenues on limitedpayment contracts are recognized over the contract period premium for deposit balance products such as our annuity and interestsensitive life policies is added to the policy account value the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance administration surrender and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder in each case benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 

  

we report investment income as revenue less investment expenses when it is earned our investment activities are integral to our insurance operations because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates contract liabilities and other product contract features these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on our net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in our insurance and annuity products for more information concerning revenue recognition investment accounting and interest sensitivity please refer to note 1 — significant accounting policies and note 3 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities investments and market risk sensitivity in this report 

  

impairment of investments we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value whereby fair value has declined below carrying value while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an investment is written down only when it has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies and note 3 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset at least in part by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation these assumptions are subjective in many cases and small changes in certain assumptions may cause material differences in reported results while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources we cannot assure that actual results will be the same as expected the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to us our discount rate rate of return on assets and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and discussed in note 9 — postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements this note also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies funded status and other related data

 item 9b other information 

  

there were no items required 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management at torchmark corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis as a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting the company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls accordingly even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time 

  

management evaluated the company’s internal control over financial reporting and based on its assessment believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 the company’s independent audit firm has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein 

  

   

february 28 2007 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and shareholders of 

torchmark corporation 

mckinney texas 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that torchmark corporation and subsidiaries “torchmark” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that torchmark maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion torchmark maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2006 of torchmark and our report dated february 28 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

annuity products offered include singlepremium deferred annuities flexiblepremium deferred annuities and variable annuities in recent years torchmark has deemphasized the marketing of annuity products and annuities in 2005 comprise less than 1 of premium income and less than 3 of insurance underwriting margin 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses all of which are generally based on company experience 

  

and on projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts 

  

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each company uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

  

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis a list of the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in the financial statements  see note 5 — future policy benefit reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws that generally permit investments in qualified municipal state and federal government obligations corporate bonds preferred and common stock real estate and mortgages where the value of the underlying real estate exceeds the amount of the loan the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities fixed maturities represented 94 of total investments at december 31 2005  see note 3 — investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis  

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies this allows torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins 

  

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in alabama delaware indiana missouri new york and texas 

  

insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory approval for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions 

  

personnel 

  

at the end of 2005 torchmark had 2169 employees and 2361 licensed employees under sales contracts 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

product marketplace and operational risks 

  

the insurance industry is a mature regulated industry populated by many firms torchmark operates in the life and health insurance sections of the insurance industry each with its own set of risks 

  

life insurance marketplace risk 

  

the life insurance industry is highly competitive and could limit torchmark’s ability to gain or maintain market share competition by product price and for market share is generally strong in the life insurance industry but is less so in torchmark’s life insurance niche markets in recent years most life insurers have targeted the smaller highly competitive higherincome market by offering asset accumulation products torchmark’s market has remained the middle income market offering individuallysold protection life insurance which is less competitive because the market is larger with fewer competing insurers and with less price sensitivity than the higher income asset accumulation marketplace 

  

torchmark’s life insurance markets are subject to risks of general economic conditions   because torchmark serves the middle income market for individual protection life insurance competition is primarily from alternative uses of the customer’s disposable income in times of economic downturns that affect employment levels potential customers may be less likely to buy policies and policyholders may fail to pay premiums 

  

torchmark’s life products are sold in selected niche markets the company is at risk should any of these markets diminish torchmark has two life distribution channels that focus on distinct market niches labor union members and military officers while both of these markets are known to have strong sales affinity the contraction of the size of either market could adversely affect sales in addition because the militaryfocused agency is independent and uses other life insurance underwriters in addition to torchmark torchmark has little control over marketing strategies of that agency which could result in lessthan favorable sales results for torchmark 

  

the development and maintenance of torchmark’s various distribution systems are critical to growth in product sales because the company’s life insurance sales are primarily made to individuals rather than groups and the face amounts sold are lower than that of policies sold in the higher income market the development maintenance and retention of adequate numbers of producing agents and direct response systems to support growth of sales in this market is critical for agents adequate compensation that is competitive with other employment opportunities and that also motivates them to increase sales is very important in direct response continuous development of new offerings and cost efficiency are key less than optimum execution of these strategies will in time lead to less than optimum growth in sales and ultimately in profits 

  

health insurance marketplace risk 

  

congress could make changes to the medicare program which could impact torchmark’s medicare supplement business medicare supplement insurance constitutes a significant portion of torchmark’s in force health insurance business because of increasing medical cost inflation and concerns about the solvency of the medicare program it is likely that changes will be made to the medicare program by congress from time to time these changes could have either a positive or negative effect on that business 

  

torchmark’s medicare supplement business could be negatively affected by alternative healthcare providers the medicare supplement business is impacted by market trends in the senior  aged health care industry that provide alternative traditional medicare such as health maintenance organizations hmos and other managed care or private plans the success of these alternative businesses could negatively affect the sales and premium growth of traditional medicare supplement insurance 

  

torchmark’s medicare supplement business is subject to intense competition primarily on the basis of price which could restrict future sales in recent years price competition in the traditional medicare supplement market has been significant characterized by some insurers who have been willing to earn very small profit margins or to under price new sales in order to gain market share in the short term torchmark believes these practices are not in the best interest of the company or consumers and has elected not to compete on those terms which has negatively affected sales should these industry practices continue it is likely that torchmark’s sales of this health product will remain depressed 

  

torchmark’s health business is at risk in the event of governmentsponsored underage65 health insurance currently torchmark’s leading health sales are from limited benefit products sold to people under age 65 these products are in demand when buyers are either self employed or their employers offer limited or no health insurance to employees if in the future the government offers comprehensive health care to people under age 65 demand for this product would likely decline given the high cost and political challenges of such a program torchmark believes this is a lowlevel risk in the foreseeable future 

  

changes in mortality economic conditions or other market conditions could significantly affect our operation and profitability the company’s insurance contracts are affected by the levels of mortality morbidity persistency and healthcare utilization that we experience the resulting levels that occur may be significantly different from the levels assumed when premium rates were first set significant variations in these levels could negatively affect profit margins and income however the company’s actuaries continually test expected to actual results 

  

torchmark’s ability to pay dividends or service any of its debt or preferred securities is limited by the amounts its subsidiaries are able to pay to the holding company torchmark’s insurance company subsidiaries its principal sources of cash flow periodically declare and distribute dividends on their common stock and preferred stock held by torchmark the holding company torchmark’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock principal and interest on any debt security or dividends on any preferred stock security is affected by the ability of its subsidiaries to pay the holding company these dividends the insurance company subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to insurance companies that limit the amount of cash dividends loans and advances that those subsidiaries may pay to the holding company for example under certain state insurance laws an insurance company generally may pay dividends only out of its unassigned surplus as reflected in its statutory financial statements filed in that state additionally dividends paid by insurance subsidiaries are generally limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations excluding capital gains and losses or 10 of statutory surplus without regulatory approval 

  

torchmark can give no assurance that more stringent restrictions will not be adopted from time to time by states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled which could have the effect under certain circumstances of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to torchmark by its subsidiaries additionally the inability to obtain approval of the previously mentioned premium rate increases in a timely manner from state insurance regulatory authorities could adversely impact the profitability and thus the ability of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries to declare and distribute dividends 

  

a ratings downgrade could negatively affect torchmark’s ability to compete ratings are an important factor in torchmark’s competitive position rating organizations periodically review the financial performance and condition of insurers including the company’s insurance subsidiaries while ratings are less important in the middleincome market than in markets focused on higher incomes or the group market a downgrade in the ratings of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the subsidiaries to market their products 

  

rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors while most of the considered factors relate to the rated company some of the factors relate to general economic conditions and circumstances outside of the company’s control 

  

investment risk 

  

the company’s investments are subject to market risks torchmark’s invested assets are subject to the customary risks of defaults and changes in market values factors that may affect the default rates and market values of invested assets include interest rate levels financial market performance and general economic conditions as well as particular circumstances affecting the businesses of individual issuers significant increases in interest rates could cause a material temporary decline in the fair value of the fixed investment portfolio reflecting unrealized fair value losses this risk is mitigated by torchmark’s operating strategy to generally hold investments to maturity recognizing the longterm nature of its offsetting life policy reserve liabilities and by torchmark’s strong operating cash flow that greatly diminishes the need to liquidate investments prior to maturity individual investments are also subject to impairment and writedown due to adverse factors affecting that investment’s particular issuer business or industry 

  

a decline in interest rates could negatively affect income declines in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the crediting rates paid on outstanding policies while torchmark attempts to manage its investments to preserve the excess investment income spread the company can give no assurance that a significant and persistent decline in interest rates will not materially affect such spreads 

  

significant decreases in interest rates could result in calls by issuers of investments where such features are available to issuers these calls could result in a decline in the company’s investment income as reinvestment of these proceeds would be at the prevailing lower rates 

  

regulatory risk 

  

regulatory changes could adversely affect our business insurance companies are subject to government regulation in each of the states in which they conduct business state agencies have broad administrative power over many aspects of the insurance business which may include premium rates marketing practices advertising licensing agents policy forms capital adequacy and permitted investments government regulators are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than our shareholders insurance laws regulations and policies currently affecting torchmark and its subsidiaries may change at any time possibly having an adverse effect on its business furthermore the company cannot predict the timing or form of any future regulatory initiatives 

  

changes in taxation could negatively affect our income changes in the way the insurance industry is taxed or increases in tax rates could increase the company’s tax burden and negatively affect its income 

  

litigation risk 

  

litigation could result in substantial judgments against the company or its subsidiaries a number of civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers in the jurisdictions in which torchmark does business involving the insurers’ sales practices alleged agent misconduct failure to properly supervise agents and other matters these lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers that are disproportionate to the actual damages including material amounts of punitive damages in some states including alabama juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages this discretion creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damages suit torchmark like other insurers is involved in this type of litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business the outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty 

  

natural disaster risk 

  

torchmark’s business is subject to risk of a catastrophic event the marketplaces of torchmark’s major subsidiaries are national in scope for all but one which is multistate because the company’s insurance policies in force are relatively lowface amounts issued to large numbers of policyholders the likelihood that a large portion of the company’s policyholder base would be affected by a natural disaster is further diluted as a result it is unlikely that even a major natural disaster covering hundreds of miles would disrupt the marketing and premium collection in more than a small portion of torchmark’s markets in addition the administration of the four leading subsidiaries is conducted in three distant locations that allow the company to take advantage of those distances to plan backup administrative support for any one of the subsidiaries in the event of disaster the company also has outside contracts for offsite backup information systems and record keeping in the event of a disaster 

  




 item 1b disclosure of unresolved staff comments 

  

as of december 31 2005 torchmark had no unresolved staff comments 

  

item 2 real estate 

  

torchmark through its subsidiaries owns or leases buildings that are used in the normal course of business liberty owns a 487000 square foot building in birmingham alabama which currently serves as liberty’s united investors’ and torchmark’s home office approximately 160000 square feet of this building is leased or available for lease to unrelated tenants by liberty liberty also operates from 48 companyowned district offices used for agency sales personnel 

  

united american owns and is the sole occupant of a 140000 square foot facility located in mckinney texas a north dallas suburb 

  

globe owns a 300000 square foot office building in oklahoma city oklahoma of which globe occupies 56000 square feet as its home office and the remaining space is either leased or available for lease globe also owns an 80000 square foot office building in oklahoma city further globe owns a 112000 square foot facility located in oklahoma city which houses the globe direct response operation

liberty and globe also lease district office space for their agency sales personnel 

  

torchmark believes that its owned and leased properties are suitable and adequate for its current business operations 

  







 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

torchmark and its subsidiaries in common with the insurance industry in general are subject to litigation including claims involving tax matters alleged breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmark’s subsidiaries employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action a number of such actions involving torchmark’s subsidiary liberty also names torchmark as a defendant based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on torchmark’s financial condition future operating results or liquidity however assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forwardlooking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges juries and appellate courts in the future this bespeaks caution particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as alabama and mississippi 

  

many of these lawsuits involve claims for punitive damages in state courts of alabama and mississippi torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards continue to occur bearing little or no relation to actual damages awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark has substantial business particularly alabama and mississippi creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit as of december 31 2005 liberty was a party to approximately 76 active lawsuits which included no employmentrelated cases and excluded interpleaders 61 of which were alabama proceedings and 4 of which were mississippi proceedings in which punitive damages were sought 

  

as previously reported in forms 10k and forms 10q liberty national life insurance company is a party to a number of lawsuits both a large number of lawsuits brought by individual plaintiffs and class action litigation with extremely broad class periods and relief sought involving allegations of racially discriminatory pricing in the sale of insurance to african americans prior to 1966 the litigation began with the december 8 1999 filing of moore v liberty national life insurance company  case no cv99bu3262s in the us district court for the northern district of alabama over 29 racedistinct mortality cases with approximately 2000 named plaintiffs have been consolidated with the moore case

the previouslyreported december 5 2005 trial date fixed by the us district court for moore was reset by that court to january 18 2006 on january 18 2006 all parties to moore submitted a joint motion for preliminary approval of settlement and a stipulation and agreement of compromise and settlement in that case to the district court after a hearing the district court entered an order preliminarily approving proposed settlement on january 25 2006 in the order the district court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement agreement conditionally certified a settlement class defined as “all black americans who have or had at the time of the policy’s termination an ownership or other legal interest in an industrial life insurance policy or burial policy issued by liberty national life insurance company or one of its former subsidiaries service insurance company of alabama or burial service insurance company of alabama on or before january 10 1966 at a higher rate than similar plans offered to similarly situated white americans” certified the class representatives and class counsel found that the claims in the case were primarily equitable and that the primary relief under the proposed settlement was injunctive and equitable with incidental monetary relief in the form of restitution not to exceed 6 million in the aggregate approved and directed the giving of notice to class members in the manner and form set out in the proposed settlement agreement beginning february 3 2006 and fixed march 31 2006 as the date for the fairness hearing pursuant to the order liberty commenced dissemination of notice to class members on february 3 2006 if approved the settlement will substantially resolve all class action issues in racedistinct pricing litigation at liberty except for certain consolidated individual claims for mental anguish and punitive damages previously asserted by approximately 2000 individual plaintiffs which claims are expressly excluded from the proposed settlement the company intends to vigorously defend those claims additional information regarding the racedistinct mortalitydual pricing litigation can be found in the company’s prior forms 10k and forms 10q 

  

as previously reported in form 10q united american insurance company has been named as a defendant in purported class action litigation filed on september 16 2004 in the circuit court of saline county arkansas on behalf of the arkansas purchasers of association group health insurance policies or certificates issued by united american through heartland alliance of america association and farm  ranch healthcare inc  smith and ivie v collingsworth et al cv20047422 the plaintiffs assert claims for fraudulent concealment breach of contract common law liability for nondisclosure breach of fiduciary duties civil conspiracy unjust enrichment violation of the arkansas deceptive trade practices act and violation of arkansas law and the rules and regulations of the arkansas insurance department declaratory injunctive and equitable relief as well as actual and punitive damages are sought by the plaintiffs united american removed the case from the saline county circuit court to the us district court for the eastern district of arkansas but the district court ordered the case back to the circuit court on december 21 2005 the us circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit denied united american’s petition for permission to appeal the district court’s decision on january 25 2006

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and to a limited extent annuities to middle income households throughout the united states torchmark views its operations by segments which are the major insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments as fully described in note 13 — business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and benefit administration of policies each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is 

  

premium revenue 

less 

policy obligations 

policy acquisition costs 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of torchmark’s capital resources including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity torchmark’s measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is 

  

net investment income 

less 

interest credited to net policy liabilities 

financing costs 

  

the tables in note 13 — business segments reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ending december 31 2005 additionally this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates yeartoyear comparability and which reconciles to torchmark’s net income that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present torchmark’s overall operations in the manner that management uses to manage the business 

  

analysis of profitability by segment 

dollar amounts in thousands 

  

    

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations torchmark’s net income increased 6 or 27 million to 495 million in 2005 and 9 or 38 million to 469 million in 2004 the growth in earnings in both periods came primarily from the life insurance segment although the investment and health segments contributed significantly in 2004 health margins improved in 2004 but were relatively flat in 2005 excess investment income declined for the first time in ten years in 2005 compressed by a flattening yield curve in that year 

  

the life insurance segment added 29 million to the 2005 increase in pretax earnings and 28 million to the 2004 increase the 2005 growth in life insurance resulted from margin improvements and 5 premium growth although there was a decline in sales volume growth in 2004 was also a result of increases in premium income and margins life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption life insurance 

  

pretax health profits rose 6 in 2004 to 175 million but rose 1 in 2005 to 177 million health premium declined 3 in 2005 as competition in torchmark’s medicare supplement business has continued to dampen health sales health premium income rose 1 in 2004 premium collected in the first policy year rose 13 in 2004 but declined 11 in 2005 health underwriting margin was flat in 2005 after having improved in 2004 the 2004 improvements were largely a result of reductions in loss ratios on a closed block of cancer business this block had contributed to declines in margins in recent years prior to 2004 see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

  

torchmark has previously stated that it offers annuities but does not plan to emphasize annuity products favoring life insurance instead see the caption annuities for further discussion 

  

the investment segment’s pretax profitability declined 6 million in 2005 after increasing 13 million in 2004 and 26 million in 2003 the low longterm interest rates available for new investments since 2002 have caused torchmark’s average portfolio yield to decline in each successive year restricting growth in net investment income and excess investment income yields on new fixedmaturity investments have been lower than the average portfolio yield since january 1 2003 in 2005 and late 2004 excess investment income was further compressed as shortterm rates rose with no meaningful change in longterm rates the increase in shortterm rates caused shortterm financing costs to increase and the income spread on torchmark’s fixedtovariable interestrate swaps to narrow see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments for a more detailed discussion 

  

total revenues rose 2 in 2005 to 31 billion in 2004 total revenues increased 5 to 307 billion from 293 billion in 2003 the life premium increase was the primary contributor to revenue growth in both periods although net investment income also contributed to the revenue growth in both periods 

  

in 2005 torchmark had immaterial aftertax realized investment gains compared with gains of 14 million in 2004 and losses of 2 million in 2003 under the caption realized gains and losses in this report torchmark presents a complete analysis and discussion of its realized gains and losses also as explained in note 13—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  torchmark management does not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of its core insurance operations or its operating segments however they can have a material positive or negative impact on net income 

  

in each of the years 2003 through 2005 torchmark’s net income was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring nonoperating items torchmark management does not view these items as components of its core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations a discussion of these items follows 

  

in 2005 torchmark recorded an aftertax charge of 955 thousand 15 million pretax pertaining to litigation this litigation involved net settlements after expenses primarily in three significant legal matters torchmark’s racedistinct mortalitydualpricing litigation its classaction cancer case and the waddell  reed litigation all of these cases relate to litigation arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to torchmark’s current operations of this pretax amount 135 million is recorded as “other income” and 15 million is recorded as “other operating expense” in the 2005 consolidated statement of operations  for more information on these litigation items see note 14—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  also in 2005 torchmark recorded a 16 million settlement benefit from an internal revenue service examination covering several years more information on this tax settlement is provided in note 8—income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  additionally a noncash aftertax charge of 369 thousand was recorded as a result of the extension in the term of a previously granted stock option for a senior officer upon retirement the option extension expense was recorded as administrative expense in the 2005 consolidated statement of operations  the tax settlement reduced tax expense 

  

as of january 1 2004 torchmark adopted statement of position 031 sop 031  an accounting rule concerning guaranteed minimum policy benefits on variable annuities the adoption of this standard resulted in a onetime aftertax charge of 72 million recorded as a change in accounting principle also during 2004 torchmark received a refund of state income taxes in the amount of 30 million after federal tax this refund resulted from the settlement of certain state tax issues concerning a discontinued operation in the mid1990s the refund reduced income tax expense in the 2004 consolidated statement of operations  

  

in 2003 net income was impacted by two nonrecurring items first torchmark sold an airplane and recognized a pretax loss of 8 million in the consolidated statements of operations this item was included as an administrative expense secondly the settlement of a federal tax issue resulted in interest due torchmark in the pretax amount of 43 million this item was included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations because the tax issue covered a period of many years the interest income on the tax refund exceeded the refund itself after expenses the effect of the tax refund on earnings was immaterial significant gains or losses from noninvestment property or significant interest income from noninvestment sources are unusual for torchmark 

  

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 and was reaffirmed at its july 28 2005 board of director’s meeting with no specified authorization amount management determines the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises and the company’s tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december 31 2005

throughout the remainder of this discussion share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow 

  

a discussion of each of torchmark’s segments follows 

  

life insurance life insurance is torchmark’s largest insurance segment its premium is also growing at a greater rate than the other insurance segments in 2005 life premium represented 59 of total premium compared with 56 in 2004 and 55 in 2003 life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 67 of the total in 2005 compared with 65 in both 2004 and 2003 additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

life insurance premium rose 5 to 15 billion in 2005 and 6 in 2004 to 14 billion life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium by channel for each of the last three years is as follows

torchmark management uses four statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” “annualized premium issued” “net sales” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelvemonth period annualized premium in force is an indicator of growth in 

  

premium revenue annualized premium issued sold is that amount of annualized premium in force added from new sales in a given period and is an indicator of the acceleration of premium growth net sales is annualized premium issued net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired management believes that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to gross annualized premium issued firstyear collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future annualized life premium in force was 16 billion at december 31 2005 an increase of 4 over 15 billion a year earlier annualized life premium in force was 14 billion at december 31 2003

the direct response group is torchmark’s leading writer of life insurance marketing is conducted primarily through direct mail but also through coop mailings television and consumer magazine advertising and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups unions and associations this group markets a line of life products primarily to juveniles their parents and other adults over age 50 the direct response operation accounted for almost 29 of torchmark’s life insurance premium during 2005 the largest of any distribution group life premium rose 10 in 2005 and 10 in 2004 

  

this group’s focus is on its juvenile life product not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile insureds parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a solicitation by direct response for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both the juveniles and their parents are lowacquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time torchmark 

  

expects that sales to the juvenile market and their parents will continue as one of this group’s premier markets management believes that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct response life insurance 

  

while the direct response group experienced strong growth in sales in 2003 and 2004 as evidenced by increases in both net sales and firstyear collected premium sales growth was not as strong in 2005 net sales rose 28 in 2003 to 97 million and 14 in 2004 to 111 million but increased 1 in 2005 to 112 million first year collected premium grew 24 in 2003 and 19 in 2004 but rose 3 to 77 million in 2005 it should be noted that the volumes measured by both of these indicators in 2005 exceeded comparable amounts in the two stronggrowth prior periods 2003 and 2004 due to the nature of torchmark’s direct response business the rate of sales growth can vary from year to year however growth in direct response life premium has trended upward in a relatively stable manner and the premium growth rate has averaged an increase of 11 over the past ten years 

  

the american income exclusive agency focuses on members of labor unions credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios life premium for this agency rose 9 to 380 million in 2005 after having increased 11 in 2004 net sales declined 4 in 2005 to 84 million from 88 million in 2004 net sales were 97 million in 2003 resulting in a decrease of 9 in 2004 firstyear collected premium also declined 4 in 2005 after having increased 5 in 2004 and 19 in 2003 as in the case of all of torchmark’s agency distribution systems continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count the american income agent count was 2027 at december 31 2005 compared with 2090 a year earlier declining 3 the agent count declined 9 in 2004 from 2291 at year end 2003 in its efforts to recruit new agents torchmark recently implemented a new incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business additionally the company continues to utilize its systematic centralized internet recruiting program to add new agents 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets its life products to primarily middleincome customers in southeastern states but has recently expanded into several other states liberty’s life premium declined slightly in both 2005 and 2004 compared with the respective prior year annualized life premium in force was 318 million at december 31 2005 flat with 2004 after having declined 1 in 2004 from 2003 life premium sales for this agency in terms of net sales were 47 million in 2005 representing a decrease of 4 in 2005 after having decreased 8 in 2004 firstyear collected premium declined 9 in 2005 to 36 million firstyear collected premium was flat in 2004 with the prior year at 40 million 

  

growth in the liberty agency’s sales and premium volume are highly dependent on growth in the agency force however this agency has experienced volatility in its agency force in the past two years liberty had 1781 producing agents at year end 2005 compared with 1638 at year end 2004 an increase of 9 but producing agents declined approximately 15 in 2004 the primary factor in sales declines in both 2004 and 2005 in the latter part of 2003 the agent’s compensation system was restructured to not only reward production and policy persistency but also to encourage retention of productive agents however the recruiting of new agents was neglected a primary cause in the 2004 decline in agent count in late 2004 liberty implemented initiatives similar to those of american income to recruit new agents primarily through use of the internet the 2005 increase in producing agents is believed to have resulted from these efforts as these agents become more seasoned they should become more productive management believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems management also expects that the increased sales from a larger and more productive agency force will lead to an acceleration in premium growth 

  

liberty’s life underwriting margins have improved steadily over the past three years as a percentage of life premium margins rose from 22 in 2003 to 24 in 2004 and then to 26 in 2005 these margin improvements resulted primarily from the reductions in acquisition costs due to the abovementioned revisions in agents’ compensation improved persistency resulting from a 2003 change in collection procedure was also a factor 

  

torchmark’s military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former military officers who sell primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of wholelife products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates in 2005 life premium was 199 million or 14 of torchmark’s total life premium premium increased 7 in 2005 from 187 million premium also rose 12 in both 2004 and 2003 annualized premium in force rose 3 in 2005 to 205 million after an increase of 11 in 2004 and 13 in 2003 military net sales declined 37 in 2005 to 18 million these sales rose 4 in 2004 firstyear collected premium declined 20 in 2005 to 22 million after an increase in 2004 of 13 this agency’s sales have been under pressure as it reorganizes its nonlife nontorchmark products this reorganization included reduced commission rates on nontorchmark investment products and resulted in a loss of 30 of this agency’s producing agents appointed with torchmark in 2005 margins in the military group were negatively affected by hostilities in the middle east in all three periods resulting in higher than expected benefits paid of 39 million in 2005 40 million in 2004 and 11 million in 2003 

  

torchmark’s other agencies consist of the united investors agency the united american independent and branch office agencies and other small miscellaneous sales agencies the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business united investors represents approximately 5 of torchmark’s life premium income the loss of a significant marketing group in 2001 has had a negative impact on production in the united investors agency since that time the united american independent and branch office agencies combined represented approximately 4 of torchmark’s total life premium life premium income and sales for these two agencies has declined for the past three years because they focus on health insurance with life sales being incidental

gross margins as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense rose 8 in 2005 to 382 million after rising 9 in 2004 as a percentage of life insurance premium gross margins have increased slightly each year improvements in life margins have resulted from several factors the previouslymentioned changes in liberty’s agent compensation system and premium collection method have contributed to notable increases in liberty’s margins additionally the percentage of american income premium to total premium continues to grow and that has caused life margins to increase because that agency’s margins are torchmark’s highest exceeding 30 in 2005 direct response margins have grown to above 25 in 2005 as it has emphasized sales of its highermargin juvenile policy 

  

  

health insurance health products sold by torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limited benefit hospitalsurgical plans cancer and accident plans sold to people under age 65 as well as medicare supplements sold to enrollees in the federal medicare program health premium represented 40 of torchmark’s total premium income in 2005 compared with 42 in 2004 and 44 in 2003 health underwriting margin accounted for 31 of the total compared with 32 in 2004 and 33 in 2003 these declines in the health percentages indicate the growth in torchmark’s life segment in relation to the health segment the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years

torchmark markets its supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels with the two united american agencies being the market leaders over the past three years torchmark has placed greater emphasis on the sale of limitedbenefit health insurance products rather than medicare supplement insurance as customer demand for the limited benefit hospitalsurgical plans has increased and price competition and lesser demand for medicare supplements has dampened sales of that product while medicare supplement still remains torchmark’s dominant health product in terms of premium income the other limitedbenefit health products have been growing rapidly in their contribution to health premium as shown in the chart above medicare supplement premium represented 60 of total health premium in 2005 but has declined steadily as a percentage of total health premium in each successive year accordingly limitedbenefit health products have increased as a percentage of total health premium each year during the same period

the united american branch office and independent agencies as discussed above the two united american agencies have emphasized sales of individual supplemental limitedbenefit health plans known generally as hospitalsurgical plans for which demand has increased in recent years these plans provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined a fixedamount surgical schedule some out patient coverage and other miscellaneous hospitalrelated charges they also contain caps on total perillness benefits consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual majormedical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limitedbenefit plans are generally lower than those of medicare supplement however the medicare supplement product has higher persistency rates resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium both of the united american agencies offer these limitedbenefit plans 

  

the united american branch office is an exclusive agency meaning the agents in its 99 offices nationwide sell only for the company in recent years this agency has been successful in building sales of limitedbenefit plans to replace the decline in medicare supplement sales net sales of limitedbenefit plans in 2005 were 78 million a 26 increase net sales in 2004 were 62 million a 41 increase over 2003 as a result total health sales at the ua branch office were 96 million a 16 increase over 2004 including the decline in medicare supplement sales premium from limitedbenefit plans at the ua branch office increased by 33 to 95 million in 2005 compared with 2004 but total health premium remained 

  

relatively unchanged at 323 million in 2005 due to the slow decline in premium from the in force medicare supplement block health premium for 2004 increased 2 from 316 million in 2003 at year end 2005 the ua branch office had 2166 producing agents compared with 1677 at year end 2004 a 29 increase this agency had 1510 agents at year end 2003 

  

the united american independent agency is composed of over 27000 independent agencies whose size range from very large multistate organizations down to oneperson offices all of whom generally sell for a number of insurance companies in the recent past most of this agency’s health sales came from one large independent agency however in 2005 the ua independent agency’s net health sales dropped by 32 to 59 million reflecting an earlier disruption in that leading agency’s recruiting and training program that resulted in a decline in producing agents while 2005 limitedbenefit premium of 98 million at the ua independent agency was up 1 compared with 2004 medicare supplement premium of 344 million declined 7 the ua independent agency has the largest in force block of medicare supplement policies total health premium for 2005 at this agency was 442 million declining 6 from 2004 while 2004 premium of 468 million was unchanged from 2003 

  

liberty national exclusive agency  predominately a life insurance distribution channel is the third largest writer of torchmark health business based on premium collected cancer supplemental plans are the limitedbenefit health products primarily produced by this agency and liberty is the only torchmark distribution channel for which cancer insurance is its primary health product approximately one half of the cancer block consists of a closed block of business which arose from a classaction settlement in the mid1990s prior to 2005 significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on the closed block were a continuing factor causing growth in health premium but increasing claims continued to reduce underwriting margins early in 2005 liberty settled a classaction lawsuit that arose over the timing and size of the rate increases on the closed block the settlement provides for claims incurred after the effective date of the settlement in early march 2005 to be paid on an actual incurred basis rather than a billed basis which management estimates will reduce benefits paid going forward it also provides for a grandfathered period for certain claimants that will allow them to be paid at billed rates for one year the settlement further requires liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an 85 claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business as a result premiums are estimated to decline from about 70 million per year prior to the settlement to about 50 million in force when the settlement is fully phased in assuming no lapsed policies prior to the settlement liberty has had a claims loss ratio above 100 on this block 

  

health premium at liberty declined 9 to 149 million in 2005 compared with 2004 because of the reduced premiums on the closed block of cancer business as described above 2004 health premium of 164 million remained unchanged from 2003 net health sales for 2005 increased 5 to 14 million compared with 2004 net health sales of 13 million which were up 12 compared with 2003 

  

american income exclusive agency also predominately a life insurance distribution channel is torchmark’s fourth largest health insurance distributor based on 2005 premium collected its health plans are comprised of various limitedbenefit plans for which almost two thirds of the agency’s 2005 health premium was from accident policies sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 

  

health premium for 2005 increased 7 over 2004 to 64 million while 2004 premium of 60 million increased 7 over 2003 net health sales of 11 million in 2005 declined 6 compared with 2004 but net sales of 12 million increased 1 over 2003 net health sales comprised only 12 of american income agency’s total net sales in 2005 

  

direct response  primarily a life operation also produces health insurance which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups in 2005 net health sales of 6 million which comprises only 5 of direct response’s total life and health net sales declined 12 compared with 2004 net health sales of 7 million the 2004 net health sales had declined 46 from 2003 net sales of 13 million health premium in 2005 was 38 million a 9 increase compared with 35 million in 2004 the 2004 premium rose 22 over 28 million of premium in 2003

annuities generate earnings from periodic policy fees and charges based on the average account balances reduced by net policy obligations less acquisition costs for fixed annuities net required interest on reserves is the required interest credited to the accounts and is offset by investment income 

  

for all three periods shown in the chart above account balances declined which resulted in reductions in policy fees and charges policy obligations also declined in each period in all three periods investment income earned exceeded required interest credited to fixed accounts resulting in negative net required interest on reserves as a result insurance underwriting margin for annuities before other income and administrative expenses increased 18 from 118 million in 2003 to 140 million in 2004 but declined 10 to 126 million in 2005 margins were benefited by a decline in guaranteed minimum policy benefits in 2004 to 28 million from 50 million in 2003 as a result of an increase in equity markets equity markets were more stable in 2005

investments excess investment income  the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  

    

the investment segment is responsible for the management of capital resources including investments debt and cash flow excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 1 3— business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” management also views excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since implementing its share repurchase program in 1986 torchmark has used over 28 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interestbearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis management believes that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

excess investment income declined 2 in 2005 to 324 million from 331 million in 2004 it increased 4 in 2004 and 9 in 2003 however on a per diluted share basis 2005 excess investment income rose 4 to 307 per share excess investment income increased 7 in 2004 and 14 in 2003 growth in excess investment income is impacted by increases in investment income due to the growth in the portfolio and changes in rates available in financial markets it is also affected by crediting rates on policy liabilities and changes in torchmark’s borrowing costs additionally share purchases in recent periods have caused excess investment income per share to grow faster than excess investment income 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income which rose 5 to 603 million in 2005 it rose 3 to 577 million in 2004 from 558 million in 2003 included in 2003 investment income was a nonrecurring interest income item resulting from a tax settlement of 43 million pretax management excludes nonrecurring items when it views investment income after excluding this item investment income rose 4 in 2004 as presented in the following chart the growth in net investment income in both periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets 

  

   

the lower growth in income is reflective of new investments made each year at longterm yields lower than the portfolio’s average yield resulting from the lower rates available in financial markets in recent years also contributing to the lower growth in yields in recent years were calls on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio as the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities given the sizeable annual cash flow from torchmark’s operations management expects mean invested assets to continue to grow but as long as the current lowinterest rate environment continues the rate of growth of investment income will be under pressure more detailed information about investment acquisitions follows under this caption 

  

excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 

  

interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

   

excess investment income was positively affected by reduced crediting rates on certain policy liabilities in 2003 and 2004 in those years the growth in interest credited to policy liabilities was not as great as the growth in the liabilities as the company was able to respond to the lowinterest environment with reduced crediting rates on fixed annuities and certain life products while annuity crediting rates were reduced in 2005 the company was not able to further reduce life and health crediting rates for more information on life and health crediting rates please refer to note 5—future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on torchmark’s various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs

the table below presents the components of financing costs 

  

analysis of financing costs 

amounts in thousands 

  

   

financing costs rose 62 or 20 million in 2005 they increased 11 or 3 million in 2004 both the 2005 and 2004 increases primarily resulted from the expiration in september 2004 of a profitable interestrate swap on which torchmark had earned over 3 million per quarter during the first three quarters of 2004 and the full year 2003 the interestrate swaps are agreements between torchmark and certain banks for which torchmark receives from the banks fixedrate payments that match the coupons that it pays to its debt holders and makes floatingrate payments based on libor rates to the banks while new swaps were entered into in august of 2004 the spreads on the new swaps were not as great as the expired swap and accounted for more than a 2 million reduction in swap benefit per quarter when compared against the expired swap these new swaps were sold in september 2005 because of a change in management’s outlook for shortterm rates during the thirteenmonth period the swaps were held torchmark earned approximately 37 million in reduced interest cost also affecting financing costs in the latter part of 2004 and the full year 2005 were rising shortterm rates these rising rates reduced the positive effect of torchmark’s other swaps and increased shortterm borrowing costs a full description of these swaps is disclosed in note 1 0— debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

torchmark’s investment strategy is to maintain a positive spread between the yield on investments and the yield on the interestbearing policy liabilities and debt it is this positive spread that results in excess investment income at the same time torchmark desires to invest predominately in investmentgrade corporate fixed maturities in prolonged periods of low longterm interest rates maintaining sufficient spread while limiting new investments to high quality securities becomes more challenging torchmark addressed this issue of low longterm rates prior to 2005 by lengthening the maturities of new investment purchases to maximize the yield and by revising the crediting rates downward on various products even though yields on new longterm investments declined there was still a significant spread of longterm yields over shortterm yields 

  

however the lower longterm interest rates combined with rising shortterm rates experienced in late 2004 and 2005 have restricted the growth of excess investment income as the yield curve flattened with rising shortterm rates but with no meaningful change in longterm rates compensation for investing longterm has been significantly diminished therefore in mid2005 torchmark revised its investment strategy to shorten the maturity of most new investments while maintaining its policy to acquire only investment grade securities the company believes that investing in shorterterm maturities is the best strategy because the reduced spreads between long and short maturities are not enough to justify investing solely in longterm bonds the lower yields could result in reduced excess investment income spreads over the shortterm 

  

in the event of an increase in longterm rates excess investment income will benefit as new acquisitions can be made at higher yields while higher shortterm rates will increase floatingrate financing costs higher longterm rates would be to torchmark’s advantage because the amount of cash invested annually significantly exceeds the amount of floating rate debt and would result in greater investment income net of financing costs under most yield curve scenarios at any rate excess investment income has grown significantly in each of the four years prior to 2005 and has exceeded fifty percent of net investment income in every year since 2000 

  

acquisitions  the chart below presents selected information about torchmark’s fixedmaturity acquisitions in the years 2003 through 2005 investmentgrade corporate securities include both bonds and trustpreferred securities classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors both yield and average life calculations on new purchases on noncallable bonds are based on the maturity date in the case of callable bonds the average life is based on the call date or maturity date whichever produces the lowest yield “yield to worst”

torchmark continues to invest exclusively in investmentgrade bonds as previously discussed torchmark attempted to maximize yield on new investments in the lowinterest environment in 2003 2004 and early 2005 by lengthening maturities as a result the average life of new fixed maturity acquisitions was 234 years in 2004 and 231 years in 2003 and the effective annual yield on new investments was 647 in 2004 and 655 in 2003 in 2005 however as torchmark’s investment strategy changed the effective annual yield on new investments declined to 590 and the average life fell to 153 years management believes that because of the longterm fixedrate characteristics of its policy liabilities the company does not have to strictly match assets and liabilities 

  

new cash flow available to torchmark for investment has been greatly affected by issuer calls as a result of the lowinterest environment experienced during the past few years issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they can refinance them at a lower cost calls increase funds available for investment but they negatively affect portfolio yield as they cause torchmark to replace higheryielding bonds with those available at lower prevailing yields calls increased during 2003 and 2004 but declined somewhat in 2005 issuer calls were 226 million in 2005 352 million in 2004 and 457 million in 2003 as long as the yields on new fixed maturity acquisitions remain below the overall portfolio yield the portfolio yield will slowly decline as will investment income and excess investment income as discussed above however because of the sizeable annual cash flow generated from operations management believes the company will be well positioned when investment interest rates eventually rebound 

  

  

portfolio analysis torchmark’s emphasis has been on bond investments over alternative investments therefore the relative percentage of torchmark’s investments by type varies from industry norms the following table presents a comparison of torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2005 with the latest industry data

additional information concerning the fixedmaturity portfolio is as follows 

  

fixed maturity portfolio selected information 

  

    

torchmark calculates the average life and duration of the fixedmaturity portfolio two ways 1 based on the same date used to calculate the yield which is the call date producing the lowest yield “worst call” date for callable bonds and the maturity date for all other bonds and 2 based on the maturity date of all bonds whether callable or not 

  

at the end of 2005 and 2004 the fixedmaturity portfolio had a gross unrealized gain of 486 million and 670 million respectively gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities were 61 million at december 31 2005 compared with 21 million a year earlier please see note 3—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an analysis of unrealized investment losses 

  

credit risk sensitivity credit risk is the level of certainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity in weak economic periods the securities of industry sectors affected by the economic downturn suffer increased credit risk as a result securities in these weakened sectors could be downgraded by creditrating agencies to belowinvestment grade status thus the likelihood the issuers will honor their securities’ terms is reduced and the securities’ market values can be negatively impacted as torchmark continues to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities credit risk is a concern torchmark mitigates this ongoing risk in part by acquiring investmentgrade bonds and by investigating the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer torchmark continues to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis at december 31 2005 approximately 94 of invested assets at fair value were held in fixedmaturity securities the major rating agencies considered 92 of this portfolio to be investment grade the average quality rating of the portfolio continues to be bbb the table below demonstrates the credit rankings of torchmark’s fixedmaturity portfolio at fair value as of december 31 2005 

  

   

torchmark’s current investment policy is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

torchmark additionally reduces credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors the following table presents the industry sectors that exceeded 2 of the corporate fixedmaturity portfolio at fair value at december 31 2005 

  

   

otherwise no individual industry represented 2 or more of torchmark’s corporate fixed maturities 

  

market risk sensitivity the primary market risk to which torchmark’s financial securities are exposed is interest rate risk meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company’s investment portfolio since torchmark’s portfolio is comprised 94 of fixedmaturity investments it is highly subject to market risk declines in market interest rates in recent years have generally resulted in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the 

  

portfolio however torchmark does not expect to realize these unrealized gains because it is generally the company’s investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity the company’s strategy would be the same should markets reverse and market rates increase placing the fixedincome portfolio in an unrealized loss position the longterm nature of torchmark’s insurance policy liabilities and strong cashflow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio the increase in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to declines in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio however in accordance with gaap these liabilities are not marked to market 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark’s interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2005 and 2004 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark’s fixedmaturity portfolio the data are prepared through a model which incorporates various assumptions and estimates to measure the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options put options and unscheduled repayments could have on the portfolio given the changes in rates the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 

  

   

realized gains and losses as a group of life and health insurance carriers torchmark collects premium income from its policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits torchmark also incurs acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of its insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason torchmark as a part of its core insurance operations holds a significant investment portfolio this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

because torchmark holds this large and diverse investment portfolio investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses occur only incidentally usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments torchmark does not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which are beyond the control of management are only secondary to torchmark’s core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders unlike investment income they are not considered in determining premium rates or product profitability of torchmark’s insurance products 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations however and as a result have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause periodtoperiod trends of net income to not be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as management 

  

views its operations for these reasons torchmark management removes the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating its overall insurance operating results 

  

the following table summarizes torchmark’s taxeffected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2005

amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  

    

in both 2004 and 2003 torchmark wrote down several individual holdings to estimated fair value as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met some or all of torchmark’s criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in note 3 — investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in its critical accounting policies in this report pretax charges for these impairments were 6 million in 2004 and 15 million in 2003 regarding all bonds previously written down the bonds of 3 issuers were still held at december 31 2005 at a fair value of 460 million and a recorded book value of 295 million 

  

accounting rules require torchmark to value its interestrate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period the fair values of these instruments fluctuate with interest rates in financial markets and diminish with the passage of time so that their value will be zero when they ultimately expire these periodtoperiod fluctuations can be substantial however torchmark management does not consider these periodtoperiod fluctuations in value in managing its ongoing operations because their cumulative result will be zero if held to expiration these temporary unrealized changes in swap values are included as a component of “realized investment gains losses” in the consolidated statements of operations  this fair value adjustment for all swaps on an aftertax basis was a negative 5 million in 2005 and 2004 compared with a negative 10 million in 2003 

  

torchmark has historically held its swaps to maturity however in the third quarter of 2005 two swaps were sold because of an expectation of higher shortterm rates in the future the swaps sold were the 99 million notional amount related to the 825 senior debentures and the 100 million notional amount associated with the 7375 notes proceeds of 239 thousand were received on the sales 

  

the securities and exchange commission’s accounting guidance currently requires that all income and expenses related to a nonhedged derivative be recorded in the same line item on the income statement that the adjustment to fair value is recorded therefore torchmark combines the cash settlements on nonhedged swaps with the noncash unrealized fair value adjustment as a component of realized investment gains and losses additionally torchmark includes the cash settlements on its hedged swap derivatives in realized investment gains and losses for consistency torchmark’s pretax interest cost reduction from these cash settlements included in realized investment gains was a positive 7 million in 2005 a positive 23 million in 2004 and a positive 26 million in 2003 torchmark continues to reduce interest cost for this benefit in its segment analysis because the segment analysis is required by gaap to be as management evaluates the performance of the segment torchmark views the benefit from lower interest rates as a reduction in its financing costs in its investment segment 

  

financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations torchmark’s liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

torchmark’s insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs sources of cash flows from operations include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes 

  

operating cash inflows significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers such as torchmark expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods sometimes many years later a liability is actuarially computed and recorded for these future benefits which increases as insurance in force grows so that torchmark can “save” for these future payments earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period but there is no corresponding cash outlay therefore cash provided from operations is generally expected to significantly exceed net income in any given period cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of torchmark’s investment portfolio cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements available cash flows are also used to repay debt to buy back torchmark shares to pay shareholder dividends and for other corporate uses while torchmark’s cash flows have historically been positive and very strong a material reduction in cash flow could negatively affect its liquidity 

  

cash flows provided from operations increased in each of the three years ended december 31 2005 over their respective prior year they were 857 million in 2005 767 million in 2004 and 740 million in 2003 in addition torchmark received 473 million in investment maturities repayments and calls in 2005 adding to available cash flows such repayments were 574 million in 2004 and 682 million in 2003 

  

torchmark has in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 600 million for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility see the commercial paper section of note 10 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

torchmark’s cash and shortterm investments were 138 million at yearend 2005 and 99 million at yearend 2004 additionally torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 89 billion at december 31 2005 however torchmark’s strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet dividend payments on common and preferred stock interest and principal repayment requirements on parentcompany debt and operating expenses of the parent company for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 11 — shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as fully described and discussed in note 10 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt torchmark has outstanding 150 million par amount 7 3  4  trust preferred securities the capital trusts which are liable for these securities are the legal entities which are responsible for the securities and facilitate the payment of dividends to shareholders they are offbalance sheet arrangements which torchmark is required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules deconsolidation is required by accounting rules because they are considered to be variable interest entities in which torchmark has no variable interest therefore torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity even though it owns all of the entity’s voting equity while these liabilities are not on torchmark’s balance sheet they are represented by torchmark’s 7 3  4  junior subordinated debentures due to the trusts these junior subordinated debentures are a torchmark liability of 155 million par and book value at both december 31 2005 and 

  

december 31 2004 and are indicated as a capital resource to torchmark under the caption capital resources in this report the 7 3  4  preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by torchmark’s 7 3  4  interest payment on its debt to the trusts as described in note 14 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements torchmark has guaranteed the performance of the capital trusts to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 

  

pension obligations to torchmark’s employees are obligations of trust fund entities which are not reflected on torchmark’s balance sheet the obligations of these trusts are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans these trust entities hold assets which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the pension obligations as they become due 

  

during 2005 torchmark subsidiary american income entered into an agreement to guarantee certain personal loans of american income employees and agents with first command bank first command bank is a subsidiary of first command financial services inc first command of which lamar c smith is chairman and ceo he is also a director of torchmark at december 31 2005 the balance subject to this guarantee was 182 thousand these guarantees are secured by vested commissions due the employees and agents see note 15—related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on this guarantee 

  

as of december 31 2005 torchmark had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of thirdparty entities other than as described above all of torchmark’s guarantees other than the trust preferred guarantee and the first command bank guarantee were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 14 — commitments and contingencies all of torchmark’s derivative instruments were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet 

  

the following table presents information about payments under torchmark’s contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december 31 2005 

  

amounts in millions 

  

      

capital resources torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in note 10 — debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements longterm funded debt junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities and shareholders’ equity the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark’s capital trusts which are liable for its trust preferred securities in accordance with gaap these instruments are included in “due to affiliates” on the consolidated balance sheets a complete analysis and description of longterm debt issues outstanding is presented in note 10—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

the carrying value of the funded debt was 688 million at december 31 2005 compared with 695 million a year earlier in connection with these instruments torchmark had in place two interestrate swap agreements at december 31 2005 but also had two swap agreements that were sold in september 2005 and another swap agreement which expired in september 2004 all of these agreements were entered into to exchange torchmark’s fixedrate obligations on the debt instruments to floating rates information about these swaps is also found in note 10  

  

the carrying value of torchmark’s 6 1  4  senior notes is adjusted each period to reflect the change in fair value of a swap instrument which hedges the value of the note this swap increased the value of longterm debt by 3 million and 57 million at december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively additionally torchmark entered into a swap agreement on its 8 1  4  senior debentures in august 2004 which qualified as a fairvalue hedge on that security that swap was disposed of in september 2005 it increased the value of longterm debt by 24 million at december 31 2004 

  

torchmark maintains a significant availableforsale fixedmaturity portfolio to support its insurance policyholders’ liabilities torchmark is required by an accounting rule sfas 115 to revalue this portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio result from changes in interest rates in financial markets while sfas 115 requires invested assets to be revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner due to the size of torchmark’s policy liabilities in relation to its shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact in the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of torchmark’s shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interestbearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets for this reason torchmark’s management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of sfas 115 when analyzing torchmark’s balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following tables present selected data related to torchmark’s capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of sfas 115 on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  

selected financial data 

  

      

torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 130 times in 2005 compared with 138 times in 2004 and 126 times in 2003 a discussion of torchmark’s interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 

  

in the second quarter of 2005 torchmark executed a voluntary stock option exercise and restoration program in which 120 directors employees and consultants exercised vested options of the company’s common stock and received a lesser number of new options at the current market price as a result the company issued 58 million new shares to the participants however a substantial number of the new shares were immediately sold through the open market by the participants to cover the option exercise price of their new shares and their related income taxes as a result of the program management’s ownership in torchmark increased and the company received a significant tax benefit from the exercise of the options torchmark received 213 million in proceeds for the exercise price and 37 million in tax benefits both of which added to shareholder’s equity however as previously mentioned torchmark generally uses the proceeds of option exercises to repurchase shares on the open market to reduce the dilution caused by option exercises as a result the total impact on shareholder’s equity and cash flow from the transaction was immaterial more information on stock options and this program is found in note 1—significant accounting policies and in note 12—stock options in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

as previously mentioned torchmark’s board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the company’s stock repurchase program in july 2005 in amounts and timing that management in consultation with the board determined to be in the best interest of the company torchmark has repurchased its common stock every year since 1986 except for 1995 the year following the acquisition of american income since the beginning of 1998 torchmark has repurchased 40 million shares at a total cost of 16 billion and has acquired no fewer than 34 million shares in any one year management believes that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings return on equity and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value as noted earlier in this report torchmark acquired 56 million shares at a cost of 300 million in 2005 with excess cash flow if the 300 million free cash flow used for the repurchase of torchmark common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds an estimated 9 million of additional investment income after tax would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have increased 10 to 459 because share purchases were made actual net income per share was 468 an increase of 12 torchmark intends to continue the repurchase of its common shares when financial markets are favorable 

  

credit ratings the credit quality of torchmark’s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies during 2003 standard and poor’s upgraded torchmark’s funded debt rating from a to a and its preferred securities rating from bbb to a the chart below presents torchmark’s credit ratings as of december 31 2005 

  

   

the financial strength of torchmark’s major insurance subsidiaries are also rated by standard  poor’s and am best standard and poor’s lowered the insurance financial strength rating of united investors to a from aa noting that united investors was no longer a strategic subsidiary to torchmark also during 2003 a m best upgraded american income’s insurance financial strength rating to a superior from a excellent the following chart presents these ratings for torchmark’s five largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2005 

  

   

am best states that it assigns a superior ratings to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 

  

the aa rating is assigned by standard  poor’s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics differing only slightly from those rated higher the a rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings the “” indicates that united investors is among the strongest insurers within the a category

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined additionally it should be noted that torchmark subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation based upon information 

  

presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by management to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 14 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

new unadopted accounting rules 

  

stock option expensing stock options have been granted to executives employees consultants and directors as a form of compensation to provide motivation and to align the interests of these groups with the same interests of shareholders because they are generally granted at the fair value of torchmark stock at the date of grant the value of these options increases as the value of torchmark stock increases the cost of these options to the company is in the dilution caused by the assumed exercise of the options as the grantees’ ownership of the company grows in relation to that of existing shareholders this dilution cost has historically been reflected in per share earnings in the financial statements under the “intrinsic value” method currently permitted by gaap and used by torchmark under this method a value is assigned to an option only if the exercise price is less than the fair value of the stock at the date of grant because torchmark’s options are generally granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of torchmark stock torchmark has historically incurred no option expense 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement 123r  sharebased payment  originally effective for torchmark as of july 1 2005 but later deferred by the securities and exchange commission to january 1 2006 the provisions of this statement will require torchmark to record an expense in the financial statements for stock options based on the “fair value” method whereby a value is assigned to each option granted and to recognize an expense as this value is amortized over the period that the option vests this expense will be deducted from earnings and earnings per share in addition to the option cost already being reflected in the dilution computation described above 

  

gaap rules currently require torchmark to disclose in note 1—significant accounting policies the impact on earnings on a pro forma basis as if the “fair value” method were in effect please refer to note 1 for more details on the impact of adoption of this revised statement as explained in note 1  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to materially alter its methodology of computing option expense or that future results will vary significantly from the pro forma results disclosed for prior periods at the present time torchmark does not plan to change its policies of stock option compensation because of the adoption of this revised statement 

  

while restatement of prior periods is permitted the statement also permits a “modified prospective” method of adoption whereby the expense of all unvested options as of january 1 2006 and options granted after january 1 2006 are expensed in accordance with the statement after that date torchmark will elect the modified prospective method of adoption 

  

the “fair value” assigned to option grants is derived from complex option pricing models using subjective assumptions such as price volatility and expected term considerable judgment is sometimes involved in the determination of these assumptions which must be made at the time of option grant variations in actual experience versus the assumptions can cause material differences in an option’s actual value when it is ultimately exercised versus its expense recorded in the financial statements however while a variety of pricing models are acceptable under the statement torchmark plans to use the blackscholes pricing model used for the pro forma disclosures with assumptions most reflective of torchmark’s experience statement 123r does not permit the recorded expense to be adjusted to reflect actual experience 

  

earnings per share as described in note 1 — significant accounting policies diluted earnings per share include the dilution resulting from the potential conversion of dilutive securities such as stock options into torchmark common stock the potential dilution from stock options has traditionally been calculated using the “treasury stock method” required by gaap this method assumes that torchmark uses the funds derived from the assumed exercise of options to buy treasury stock thus reducing the net number of new shares outstanding resulting from the exercise 

  

  

the issuance by the fasb of statement 123r requiring the expensing of stock options revises the method of computing dilutive shares the revised method does not allow the traditional treasury stock method which simulates cash flow but instead limits cash receipts from the tax benefit and injects a hypothetical concept known as “unrecognized option expense” to the dilution model as a result diluted shares outstanding under the new standard will bear no relationship to diluted shares outstanding under the historical model or to a pattern that the company could actually replicate with its cash flow as before management does not believe that these modifications to the treasury stock method will materially impact earnings per share 

  

impairments of investments the fasb issued fasb staff position fas 1151 and fas 1241 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” effective for torchmark january 1 2006 this statement clarifies certain previously unresolved issues regarding accounting for investment impairments no significant impact is expected from adoption 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts torchmark’s insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements while management and company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents torchmark’s ultimate obligation additionally because of the size of this liability significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note 5 — future policy benefit reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales additionally the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption “value of insurance purchased” torchmark’s policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note 1 — significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements different assumptions with regard to deferred acquisition costs could produce materially different amounts of amortization for more information about accounting for deferred acquisition costs see note 4 — deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to the company however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made torchmark management believes that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be torchmark’s ultimate obligation 

  

revenue recognition premium income for torchmark’s subsidiaries’ insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected however in accordance with gaap revenue on limitedpayment contracts and universal lifetype contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently revenues on limitedpayment contracts are recognized over the contract period premium for 

  

deposit balance products such as torchmark’s annuity and interestsensitive life policies is added to the policy account value the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance administration surrender and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder in each case benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 

  

investment income is reported as revenue by torchmark when it is earned less investment expenses the investment activities of torchmark are integral to its insurance operations because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates contract liabilities and other product contract features these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on torchmark’s net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products for more information concerning revenue recognition investment accounting and interest sensitivity please refer to note 1 — significant accounting policies and note 3 — investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities investments and market risk sensitivity in this report 

  

impairment of investments torchmark continually monitors its investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value while the values of the investments in torchmark’s portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an investment is considered to be impaired only when it has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary the policies and procedures that torchmark uses to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1 — significant accounting policies and note 3 — investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report 

  

while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans torchmark maintains funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees it also has unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees torchmark’s obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are partially offset by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining torchmark’s obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in torchmark’s pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation these assumptions are subjective in many cases and small changes in certain assumptions may cause material differences in reported results while management has used its best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources no assurance can be given that actual results will be the same as expected the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to the company torchmark’s discount rate rate of return on assets and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed in note 9 — postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements this note also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies funded status and other related data

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management at torchmark corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control on an annual basis as a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting the company utilizes the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls accordingly even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time 

  

management evaluated the company’s internal control over financial reporting and based on its assessment believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 the company’s independent audit firm has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein

to the board of directors and shareholders of 

torchmark corporation 

birmingham alabama 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that torchmark corporation and subsidiaries “torchmark” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that torchmark maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion torchmark maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 of torchmark and our report dated february 27 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

annuities 

  

annuity products offered include singlepremium deferred annuities flexiblepremium deferred annuities and variable annuities in recent years torchmark has deemphasized the marketing of annuity products and annuities in 2004 comprise less than 2 of premium income and less than 3 insurance underwriting margin 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses all of which are generally based on the experience of each insurance subsidiary and on projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from that which has been assumed in premium pricing and to the extent investment income exceeds that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policy accounts 

  

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each company uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

  

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis a list of the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in the financial statements  see note 7—future policy benefit reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements reserves for annuity products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credits and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments 

  

investments 

  

the nature quality and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws that generally permit investments in qualified municipal state and federal government obligations corporate bonds preferred and common stock real estate and mortgages where the value of the underlying real estate exceeds the amount of the loan the investments of torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of highquality investmentgrade securities fixed maturities represented 94 of total investments at december 31 2004  see note 3—investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis  

  

competition 

  

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

management believes torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies allowing torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining underwriting margins in the case of medicare supplement business having low expense levels is necessary in order to meet federally mandated loss ratios and achieve the desired underwriting margins torchmark’s years of experience in the direct response business are a valuable asset in implementing direct response marketing operations 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all torchmark insurance subsidiaries are adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes 

  

holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in alabama delaware indiana missouri new york and texas 

  

insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory approval for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions 

  

personnel 

  

at the end of 2004 torchmark had 2091 employees and 2331 licensed employees under sales contracts additionally approximately 38000 independent and exclusive agents and brokers who were not employees of torchmark were associated with torchmark’s marketing efforts

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

torchmark and its subsidiaries in common with the insurance industry in general are subject to litigation including claims involving tax matters alleged breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmark’s subsidiaries employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action a number of such actions involving torchmark’s subsidiary liberty also name torchmark as a defendant based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on torchmark’s financial condition future operating results or liquidity however assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forwardlooking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges juries and appellate courts in the future this bespeaks caution particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts such as alabama and mississippi 

  

many of these lawsuits involve claims for punitive damages in state courts of alabama and mississippi torchmark’s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards continue to occur bearing little or no relation to actual damages awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark has substantial business particularly alabama and mississippi creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit as of december 31 2004 liberty was a party to approximately 70 active lawsuits which included no employmentrelated cases and excluded interpleaders 57 of which were alabama proceedings and 9 of which were mississippi proceedings in which punitive damages were sought

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance and to a limited extent annuities to middle income households throughout the united states torchmark views its operations by segments which are the major insurance product lines of life health and annuities and the investment segment that supports the product lines segments are aligned based on their common characteristics comparability of the profit margins and management techniques used to operate each segment 

  

insurance product line segments  as fully described in note 15—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the product line segments involve the marketing underwriting and benefit administration of policies each product line is comprised of the various distribution units that market the insurance policies whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole or the individual distribution units within the segment the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin which is premium revenue reduced by policy benefit obligations and policy acquisition expenses underwriting margin is useful to management in evaluating the performance of the insurance product line segments and their underlying distribution units because each distribution unit tends to operate in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that niche these measures enable management to view periodtoperiod trends and make informed decisions regarding future courses of action 

  

investment segment the investment segment involves the management of torchmark’s capital resources including the investment of cash generated from operations in appropriate investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity torchmark’s measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income which is income earned on the investment portfolio less the interest credited to net policy liabilities and less the company’s financing costs 

  

the tables in note 15—business segments demonstrate the measures of profitability those tables also reconcile torchmark’s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the threeyear period ending december 31 2004 additionally this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates yeartoyear comparability and which reconciles to torchmark’s net income that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present torchmark’s overall operations in the manner that management uses to manage the business 

  

analysis of profitability by segment 

dollar amounts in millions 

  

    

torchmark’s operations on a segmentbysegment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 

  

summary of operations torchmark’s net income increased 9 or 38 million to 469 million in 2004 and 12 or 47 million to 430 million in 2003 the growth in earnings in both periods came primarily from the life insurance and investment segments although health contributed in 2004 due to improvement in margins the investment contribution was less in 2004 than in the prior year 

  

the life insurance segment added 28 million to the 2004 increase in earnings and 26 million to the 2003 increase life insurance growth has been a result of increases in sales volumes premium and improvements in margins in both 2004 and 2003 and is discussed further under the caption life insurance  

  

pretax health profits rose 6 10 million in 2004 to 175 million after having declined by 2 3 million to 164 million in 2003 health premium income rose 1 in both 2004 and 2003 growth in health premium has been limited in recent periods because of competitive pressures in torchmark’s medicare supplement business health sales as represented by premium collected in the first policy year rose 13 in 2004 after increasing 2 in 2003 health underwriting margin improved in 2004 primarily as a result of reductions in loss ratios on a closed block of cancer business this block had contributed to declines in margins in recent years prior to 2004 see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 

  

the annuity segment profits have been adversely affected by replacement activity of torchmark’s policies by a former distributor torchmark has previously stated that it will offer annuities but does not plan to emphasize annuity products favoring life insurance instead see the caption annuities for further discussion 

  

the investment segment’s pretax profitability increased 13 million in 2004 and 26 million in 2003 the decline in the increase in profitability is the result of the low and falling interest rate environment during the 20032004 period the investment segment includes net investment income offset by interest on insurance liabilities and financing costs yields on new investments averaging 63 have been lower than the portfolio yield of 71 since the first quarter of 2003 as a result net investment income has 

  

grown at a lower rate than the corresponding growth rate in invested assets additionally proceeds from called or matured bonds totaling 104 billion in 20032004 were invested at yields lower than that of the replaced bonds lower interest rates credited to the insurance liabilities and benefits from the interestrate swaps on torchmark’s debt have somewhat mitigated the effect of lower interest rates on the investment segment but the net effect has been detrimental see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments for a more detailed discussion 

  

total revenues rose 5 in 2004 to 307 billion exceeding 3 billion for the first time in torchmark’s history in 2003 total revenues increased 6 to 293 billion from 276 billion in 2002 the life premium increase was the primary contributor to revenue growth in both periods accounting for over half of the revenue growth each year net investment income added 14 of the revenue growth in 2004 and 23 in 2003 

  

under the caption realized gains and losses in the report torchmark presents a complete analysis and discussion of its realized gains and losses as also explained under that caption torchmark management does not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of its core insurance operations however they can have a material positive or negative impact on net income in 2004 torchmark had aftertax realized investment gains of 14 million compared with losses of 2 million in 2003 and losses of 25 million in 2002 realized gains and losses in all periods were favorably impacted by the effects of torchmark’s interestrate swap derivatives which as explained in the following paragraph are included in realized gains and losses writedowns of investments due to the deterioration in credit quality of certain investments had a negative impact in each period particularly in 2002 

  

as also explained under the discussion of realized gains and losses torchmark views the benefit of the reduced interest cost resulting from the swap of its fixed–rate interest obligations to variable rates as a reduction in interest costs in addition to the beneficial impact on earnings from this interest cost differential due to these swaps gaap rules also require that all derivatives including torchmark’s swaps must be valued at market value with periodtoperiod changes reflected in earnings in accordance with gaap these changes in value are treated as realized gains and losses in 2003 the securities and exchange commission informally interpreted the gaap rules affecting the reporting of torchmark’s swap instruments stating that all income and expenses related to nonhedged derivatives must be reported in the same line item as the required fair value adjustment to comply with this interpretation torchmark reports the interest expense reduction on all of its swap derivatives in its consolidated statements of operations as a realized investment gain not as a reduction in interest expense torchmark continues to report this interest savings as a reduction in interest cost in its segment analysis and in its management’s discussion as gaap requires the segment disclosures to be as torchmark manages its investment segment 

  

in 2004 and 2003 torchmark’s net income was affected by certain significant unusual and nonrecurring items torchmark management does not view these items as components of its core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations a discussion of these items follows 

  

during 2004 torchmark received a refund of state income taxes in the amount of 30 million after federal tax this refund resulted from the settlement of certain state tax issues concerning a discontinued operation in the mid1990s and reduced income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations  in 2003 net income was impacted by two nonrecurring items first torchmark sold an airplane and recognized a pretax loss of 8 million in the consolidated statements of operations  this item was included as an administrative expense secondly the settlement of a federal tax issue resulted in interest due torchmark in the pretax amount of 43 million this item was included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations  because the tax issue covered a period of many years the interest income on the tax refund exceeded the refund itself after expenses the effect of the tax refund on earnings was immaterial significant gains or losses from noninvestment property or significant interest income from noninvestment sources are unusual for torchmark 

  

torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 and was reaffirmed at its july 29 2004 board of director’s meeting with no specified authorization amount management determines the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company’s excess cash 

  

flow general market conditions and other alternative uses the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable additionally when stock options are exercised proceeds from these exercises are used to repurchase approximately the number of dilutive shares issued as a result of the option exercises the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december 31 2004 

  

   

throughout the remainder of this discussion share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow 

  

a discussion of each of torchmarks segments follows 

  

  

life insurance life insurance is torchmark’s largest insurance segment its premium is also growing at a greater rate than the other insurance segments in 2004 life premium represented 56 of total premium compared with 55 in 2003 and 54 in 2002 life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 65 of the total in 2004 compared with 65 in 2003 and 62 in 2002 additionally investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 

  

life insurance premium rose 6 to 14 billion in 2004 and 7 in 2003 to 13 billion life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels premium by channel for each of the last three years is as follows

torchmark management uses two statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term “annualized premium in force” and “firstyear collected premium” annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the next twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the period annualized premium in force is an indicator of growth in premium revenue firstyear collected premium is a measure of sales and is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year firstyear collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium in force due to new sales

the direct response group is torchmark’s leading writer of life insurance marketing is conducted primarily through direct mail but also through coop mailings television and consumer magazine advertising and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups unions and associations this group markets a line of life products primarily to juveniles their parents and other adults over age 50 the direct response operation accounted for almost 28 of torchmark’s life insurance premium during 2004 life premium rose 10 in 2004 and 11 in 2003 at december 31 2004 life annualized premium in force was 443 million which represented 29 of torchmark’s total the largest of any distribution group life insurance annualized premium in force rose 9 in 2004 after growing 13 in 2003 

  

growth in premium income and annualized premium in force resulted from strong sales of direct response products in each period as evidenced by the increases in firstyear collections of 19 to 74 million in 2004 and 24 to 63 million in 2003 these increases in firstyear collections were the largest of any life distribution group in either period the growth in sales is largely attributable to this group’s focus on its juvenile life product this product was recently recharacterized as a larger faceamount product with a higher annual premium and has been a successful product for this market not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile insureds parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a solicitation by direct response for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population also both the juveniles and their parents are lowacquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time torchmark expects that sales to the juvenile market and their parents will continue as one of this group’s premier markets management believes that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct response life insurance 

  

the american income exclusive agency focuses on members of labor unions credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios this agency was torchmark’s fastest growing life insurance agency during both 2003 and 2002 in terms of premium income and annualized premium in force but growth slowed in 2004 annualized life premium in force rose 9 to 377 million at yearend 2004 after having increased 15 in 2003 while premium income rose 11 in 2004 and 14 in 2003 sales in terms of firstyear collected premium grew 5 in 2004 after having risen 19 in 2003 and 35 in 2002 growth in sales for this agency is driven by the growth in the number of its agents american income’s agent count was 1768 at year end 2001 growing 12 to 1975 at year end 2002 and 16 to 2291 at year end 2003 in 2004 however the agent count fell 9 to 2090 at december 31 as in the case of all of torchmark’s agency distribution systems continued increases in sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count american income’s marketing organization has renewed its efforts to improve agent recruiting retention and productivity in order to increase the size of this agency in particular this agency began in the third quarter of 2004 to focus on updating its internet recruiting program in an effort to add new agents in the fourth quarter of 2004 the agent count increased 2 primarily as a result of these efforts 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets primarily to middleincome markets in several southeastern states liberty’s life premium was flat in 2004 compared with 2003 at 304 million in 2003 life premium grew 1 over the prior year annualized life premium in force was 318 million at december 31 2004 declining 1 in 2004 after having risen 1 in 2003 life premium sales for this agency in terms of firstyear collected premium was flat in each of the years 2002 through 2004 at 40 million growth in sales and premium volume are highly dependent on growth in the agency force liberty had 1775 agents at year end 2004 compared with 2197 at year end 2003 and 2203 at year end 2002 these counts represent a decrease of 19 in 2004 and were essentially flat in 2003 

  

the count of renewal agents those agents that have been with liberty for more than one year declined 7 to 856 at yearend 2003 but rose 4 to 892 by yearend 2004 renewal agents are generally higher producers than firstyear agents in the latter part of 2003 the agent’s compensation system was restructured to not only reward production but also to encourage retention of productive agents however the recruiting of new agents declined in the third quarter of 2004 liberty implemented initiatives similar to those of american income to recruit new agents primarily through use of the internet as a result total agent count rose 116 or 7 during the fourth quarter of 2004 management believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems 

  

liberty’s life underwriting margins rose in the 2004 period over the prioryear period from 22 to 24 of premium these margin improvements resulted primarily from the reductions in acquisition costs due to the revisions in agents’ compensation improved persistency resulting from a 2003 change in collection procedure was also a factor in the 2004 margin improvements 

  

torchmark’s military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and noncommissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates the military agency has steadily grown in 2004 life premium was 187 million or 13 of torchmark’s total life premium premium rose 12 in both 2004 and 2003 this agency continues to grow as annualized premium in force rose 11 in 2004 to 199 million after an increase in 2003 of 13 one key to the growth of premium income and premium in force in this agency is the high persistency of the business sales of this agency grew 13 in terms of firstyear premium collected in 2004 to 27 million after a 13 increase in 2003 margins in the military group were negatively affected by hostilities in the middle east in 2004 and 2003 resulting in additional benefits paid of 40 million and 11 million respectively 

  

torchmark’s other agencies consist of the united investors agency the united american independent and branch office agencies and other small miscellaneous sales agencies the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business prior to 2001 united investors’ distribution was primarily through the sales representatives of a former torchmark subsidiary that was spun off in 1998 united investors terminated the agency contract with that organization in 2001 the loss of that sales group has had a negative impact on production in the united investors agency the united american independent and branch office agencies combined represented approximately 40 of other agency premium in 2004 or 5 of the torchmark total life premium for these agencies has been relatively flat for the past three years because these two agencies focus on health insurance with life sales being incidental

gross margins as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense rose 9 in both 2004 and 2003 over the respective prior year as a percentage of life insurance premium gross margins have increased each year improvements in life margins have resulted from several factors the previouslymentioned changes in liberty’s agent compensation system and premium collection method have contributed to notable increases in liberty’s margins additionally the percentage of american income premium to total premium continues to grow and that has caused life margins to increase because that agency’s margins are torchmark’s highest at 30 direct response margins have grown to above 25 as it has emphasized sales of its juvenile policy a highermargin product

at december 31 2004 medicare supplement accounted for 61 of torchmark’s annualized health premium in force compared with 65 in 2003 and 69 in 2002 medicare supplement annualized premium in force declined as a percentage of total annualized health premium in force reflective of the changes in product mix in sales of health products as greater emphasis has been placed on sales of other limitedbenefit plans the medicare supplement market has become more difficult in recent periods due to regulatory pressures and increased competition resulting in declines in sales and premium in force for this product while medicare supplement still remains torchmark’s dominant health product in terms of annualized premium hospitalsurgical products have been growing rapidly in their contribution to health premium this product line has risen from 14 of annualized health premium in force in 2002 to 22 in 2004

the united american branch office and independent agencies are the predominant distributors of torchmark’s health products these agencies accounted for 791 million or 75 of 2004 health premium income and 134 million or 81 of firstyear collected premium historically medicare supplement has been the primary product sold by these agencies however in recent periods medicare supplement sales have not been emphasized by these two agencies as their focus has shifted to distributing limitedbenefit hospitalsurgical policies sold to customers under age 65 medicare supplement sales have been under pressure for the last several years from increased price competition and as the average price of the most popular plans has increased rapidly in the past years affordability has become an issue for some seniors both factors have increased the difficulty for agents making sales of medicare supplements accordingly these agencies have expanded their product lines as increased consumer demand for underage65 supplemental health products has resulted from the growing unavailability of individual major medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers not only did the price competition make sales more difficult but additionally many of the united american branch office agents left torchmark for competitors whose lowerpriced 

  

medicare supplement products were easier to sell this trend of agent losses reversed in 2003 as this agency began to focus on other supplemental health products and as torchmark’s medicare supplement premium rate increases have moderated producing agents at the united american branch office agency declined to 1280 at year end 2002 but then rose 18 in 2003 to 1510 in 2004 this count rose 11 to 1677 at year end medicare supplement firstyear collected premium fell 14 in 2004 to 55 million from 65 million in 2003 in 2003 medicare supplement firstyear collections were down 29 from 92 million the prior year 

  

even though price competition has been a negative factor torchmark intends to continue to market its medicare supplement product as a major health product offering medicare beneficiaries represent a large and growing group of potential customers even though margins in this product are limited due to heavy regulation standardized benefit plans compensation limitations to agents and mandated loss ratios it still remains a profitable product to torchmark 

  

medicare supplement policies are highly regulated at both the federal and state levels with standardized benefit plans limits on first year agent compensation and mandated minimum loss ratios other regulatory issues continue to affect the medicare supplement market medical cost inflation and changes to the medicare program necessitate annual rate increases which generally require state insurance department approval the medicare program is constantly being studied and reviewed by congress and the executive branch with changes in the program expected from time to time 

  

however medicare supplements remain a popular supplemental health policy with the country’s large and growing group of medicare beneficiaries about 85 of all medicare beneficiaries have medicare supplements to cover at least some portion of the deductibles and coinsurance that the federal medicare program does not pay because of minimum loss ratio regulation underwriting margins on medicare supplements are lower than those on torchmark’s life business however due to united american’s low cost serviceoriented customer assistance and claims administration as well as its economies of scale it is a profitable line of business in 2003 congress passed legislation that in 2006 will provide medicare covered prescription drugs a benefit not previously covered by medicare while this is a major addition to the medicare program it will have little effect on torchmark’s medicare supplement business because the legislation does not require medicare supplements to cover the copays and deductibles that the medicare drug program does not cover torchmark does not write any medicare supplement plans that provide prescription drug coverage at this time it appears that there will continue to be an important role for private insurers such as torchmark in helping senior citizens cover their healthcare costs as a result medicare supplements should continue as a popular product for seniorage consumers 

  

as discussed above the united american agencies have emphasized sales of other limited benefit health products for which demand has increased in recent years consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability of individual majormedical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers margins on these other supplemental health plans are generally higher than those of medicare supplement however the medicare supplement product has higher persistency rates both of the united american agencies offer these limited benefit plans most of the plans being written are limitedbenefit hospital and surgical plans that are lower cost alternatives to individual major medical plans or that are bought to supplement employersponsored group health plans because of the limits on maximum benefits and other limits these type plans are relatively less subject to the high rate increases that have been experienced in major medicaltype plans 

  

sales of other limitedbenefit health products in terms of firstyear collected premium rose 35 in 2004 to 97 million over 72 million in 2003 annualized premium in force for other health products grew 21 in 2004 to 237 million after rising 36 in 2003 to 195 million 

  

cancer business is primarily produced by the liberty national agency cancer annualized premium in force represented 17 of torchmark’s total health premium in force at december 31 2004 annualized premium in force declined 2 in 2004 but rose 5 in 2003 approximately one half of the total cancer annualized premium in force consists of a closed block of cancer business which arose from a class action settlement in the midnineties significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on this closed block of business have been a continuing factor affecting growth in cancer premium in force in prior periods cancer sales in terms of firstyear collected premium were 122 million in 2004 26 above 96 million sold in 2003 firstyear collections in 2003 increased 11 over the prior year

health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense increased 6 in 2004 from 164 million to 175 million in 2003 health underwriting income declined 2 from 167 million in 2002 as a percentage of premium underwriting income before other income and administrative expense rose in 2004 to 166 largely as a result of the reduced loss ratios in the previouslymentioned closed block of cancer business at liberty in recent years this block of business has experienced high loss ratios even though frequent premium rate increases have been implemented the high loss ratios have been a result of increased claim costs due to the additional benefits required in the classaction settlements as a percentage of premium health margin declined from 172 in 2001 to 164 in 2002 and to 159 in 2003 a downtrend primarily caused by the growing loss ratios of this block the company recently announced that it has reached an agreement with parties in a classaction lawsuit  roberts v liberty national life insurance company  related to this block of business see part 1 item 3 – legal proceedings  the settlement provides for claims incurred after the effective date of the settlement in early march 2005 to be paid on an actual incurred basis rather than a billed basis which management estimates will reduce benefits paid going forward it also provides for a grandfathered period for certain claimants that will allow them to be paid at billed rates for one year the settlement also requires liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an 85 claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business as a result premiums are estimated to decline from about 70 million per year prior to the settlement to about 50 million in force when the settlement is fully phased in assuming no lapsed policies prior to the settlement liberty has had a claims loss ratio above 100 on this block 

  

annuities annuity products are marketed by torchmark subsidiaries to service a variety of consumer needs including retirement income and longterm taxdeferred growth opportunities annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis annuities represented 1 of torchmark’s 2004 premium revenue and less than 3 of insurance underwriting margin while torchmark continues to market annuity products it does not emphasize this segment

annuity policy charges have declined in each period as the average annuity account balance upon which the majority of charges were based has declined annuity underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses rose 18 to 14 million in 2004 even though policy charges declined in 2004 the primary factor in this increase was the reduction in policy obligations resulting from the decline in guaranteed minimum death benefits from 50 million in 2003 to 28 million in 2004 due to higher equity markets in 2004 when compared with the prior year a significant portion of product profitability of fixed annuities is derived from the spread of investment income earned versus contractual interest requirements credited to the policies because this interest spread exceeds policy benefit obligations net policy obligations result in a negative balance and increase underwriting margin underwriting margins declined from 15 million in 2002 to 12 million in 2003 the 2003 decline resulted from the decline in the average annuity account balance even though the end of year balance rose 6 in 2003 guaranteed minimum death benefits increased slightly in 2003 from 48 million

investments the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in millions except for per share data 

  

    

the investment segment is responsible for the management of capital resources including investments debt and cash flow excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations it is the measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note 15—business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” management also views excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company since 1986 torchmark has used over 25 billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares under its ongoing share repurchase program after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest bearing assets but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis management believes that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 

  

excess investment income rose 4 in 2004 to 331 million it increased 9 in 2003 and 16 in 2002 excess investment income per diluted share increased 7 in 2004 to 295 per share from 275 per share it increased 14 in 2003 and 21 in 2002 growth in excess investment income is impacted by increases in investment income due to the growth in the portfolio and changes in rates available in financial markets it is also affected by crediting rates on policy liabilities and changes in torchmark’s borrowing costs additionally share purchases in recent periods have caused excess investment income per share to grow faster than excess investment income 

  

the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income which rose 3 to 577 million in 2004 and 7 to 558 million in 2003 included in 2003 investment income was a nonrecurring interest income item resulting from a tax settlement of 43 million pretax after excluding the nonrecurring item as management views investment income investment income rose 4 in 2004 and 7 in 2003 while mean invested assets at book value grew 7 in both periods the decline in the growth rate of investment income is the result of falling investment interest rates for the period beginning with the second quarter of 

  

2003 through 2004 as a result the average yield on new investment acquisitions during that period was below the total portfolio yield further calls on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio increased during the period and the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities given the sizable annual cash flow from torchmark’s operations management expects mean invested assets to continue to grow but as long as the current lowinterest rate environment continues the rate of growth of investment income will be under pressure more information about investment acquisitions follows under this caption 

  

excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 

  

interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities 

dollar amounts in millio ns 

  

   

excess investment income has been positively affected by reduced crediting rates on certain policy liabilities in both periods while interest credited increased 4 to 213 million in 2004 the 8 increase in average net policy liabilities in 2004 was partially offset by the decline in crediting rates from 546 to 523 the 7 increase in interest credited in 2003 resulted from the 10 increase in average net liabilities offset by a reduction in the average crediting rate to 546 from 564 as discussed under the caption annuities  the 10 growth in net policy liabilities in 2003 was primarily due to the annuity production from a new united american general agency and the transfers from united investor variable policies to fixed annuities due to the deteriorating equity markets the lower average crediting rates in both 2004 and 2003 resulted from reductions made by the company in response to the low interestrate environment 

  

financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on torchmark’s various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs

the table below presents the components of financing costs 

  

analysis of financing costs 

amounts in millions 

  

   

financing costs rose 11 or 3 million in 2004 the 2004 increase primarily resulted from the expiration in september 2004 of a profitable interestrate swap on which torchmark had earned over 3 million per quarter during the first three quarters of 2004 the interestrate swaps are agreements between torchmark and certain banks for which torchmark receives from the banks fixed rate payments that match the coupons that it pays to its debt holders and makes floating rate payments based on libor rates to the banks while new swaps were entered into in august of 2004 the spreads on the new swaps were not as great as the expired swap and accounted for slightly more than 1 million of reduced interest cost per quarter also affecting financing costs in 2004 were rising shortterm rates in the latter part of the year these rising rates reduced the positive effect of torchmark’s other swaps and increased shortterm borrowing costs financing costs declined 15 in 2003 the significant decline in shortterm interest rates from those of 2002 was a factor in the decline as it reduced shortterm borrowing costs in 2003 and it favorably impacted the benefit of torchmark’s interestrate swaps a full description of these swaps is disclosed in note 12—debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

torchmark’s investment strategy is to maintain a positive spread between yields on investments and the company’s required yield on policy and financing costs it is this positive spread that results in excess investment income at the same time torchmark desires to invest predominately in investmentgrade quality corporate fixed maturities in prolonged periods of low interest rates maintaining sufficient spread while limiting new investments to high quality becomes more challenging because torchmark’s policy liabilities are very longterm in nature with predominantly fixed crediting rates a lowrate environment must exist for a considerable period of time before any meaningful negative impact will be made on the spread nevertheless torchmark has addressed this issue in the recent periods of declining rates by lengthening maturities of new investment purchases to maximize the yield and revising the crediting rates on various products 

  

the chart below presents selected information about torchmark’s fixedmaturity acquisitions in the years 2002 through 2004 investmentgrade corporate securities include both bonds and trustpreferred securities classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors both yield and average life calculations on new purchases on noncallable bonds are based on the maturity date in the case of callable bonds the average life is based on the call date or maturity date whichever produces the lowest yield “yield to worst”

as rates have declined in recent periods torchmark has attempted to maximize yield on new investments by lengthening maturities as shown above management believes that the longterm fixedrate characteristics of its policy liabilities do not result in negative asset and liability matching in years prior to 2003 torchmark was able to maintain yields in excess of 725 on new acquisitions of investmentgrade bonds in 2003 and in 2004 however yields at this level were unavailable for investmentgrade bonds due to the lower interestrate environment as a result new money was invested at an average effective yield of 647 in 2004 and 655 in 2003 in addition to the investment of new cash flow the loweryield environment during this period also impacted torchmark as calls by issuers of securities have accelerated issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they can refinance them at a lower cost these calls cause torchmark to replace higheryielding bonds with those available at lower prevailing yields for the 20032004 period bonds at a book value of 796 million were called yielding an average of 72 

  

as long as the current yields on new fixed maturity acquisitions remain at or below those of the 20032004 period the overall yield on the investment portfolio will slowly decline as will investment income and excess investment income torchmark has taken steps to minimize the potential impact of lower rates maximizing the yield on investmentgrade fixed maturity acquisitions by lengthening the life of acquisitions reducing crediting rates on certain policy liabilities and using interest rate swap agreements to offset some of its fixed rate debt management believes its strategy to mitigate the lower interest rate environment is appropriate and with the sizeable annual cash flow generated from operations the company will be well positioned when investment interest rates eventually rebound 

  

torchmark’s emphasis has been on bond investments over investments in equities mortgages or real estate therefore the relative percentage of torchmark’s investments by type continues to vary from industry norms the following table presents a comparison of torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2004 with the latest industry data

torchmark calculates the average life and duration of the fixedmaturity portfolio two ways 1 based on the same date used to calculate the yield which is the “worst call” date for callable bonds and the maturity date for all other bonds and 2 based on the maturity date of all bonds whether callable or not 

  

at the end of both 2004 and 2003 the fixedmaturity portfolio had a gross unrealized gain of 670 million gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities were 21 million at december 31 2004 compared with 39 million a year earlier 

  

  

credit risk sensitivity  credit risk is the level of certainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity in weak economic periods the securities of industry sectors affected by the economic downturn suffer increased credit risk as a result securities in these weakened sectors could be downgraded by creditrating agencies to belowinvestment grade status thus the likelihood the issuers will honor their securities’ terms is reduced and the securities’ market values can be negatively impacted as torchmark continues to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities credit risk is a concern torchmark mitigates this ongoing risk in part by acquiring investmentgrade bonds and by investigating the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer torchmark continues to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis at december 31 2004 approximately 94 of invested assets at fair value were held in fixedmaturity securities the major rating agencies considered 92 of this portfolio to be investment grade the average quality rating of the portfolio continues to be bbb the table below demonstrates the credit rankings of torchmark’s fixedmaturity portfolio at fair value as of december 31 2004 

  

   

torchmark’s current investment policy is to acquire only investmentgrade obligations thus any increases in below investmentgrade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

torchmark additionally reduces credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors the following table presents the industry sectors that exceeded 2 of the corporate fixedmaturity portfolio at fair value at december 31 2004 

  

   

otherwise no individual industry represented 2 or more of torchmark’s corporate fixed maturities 

  

market risk sensitivity market risk is the risk that the value of a security will change because of a change in market conditions torchmark’s primary exposure to market risk is interestrate risk which is the risk that a change in a security’s value could occur because of a change in interest rates unrealized changes in value caused by changes in interest rates are significant to torchmark’s investment portfolio because its fixedmaturity holdings at amortized cost represent approximately 94 of total investments and 59 of its total assets the effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixed investments are reflected on an aftertax basis in torchmark’s shareholders’ equity because these investments are marked to fair value under sfas 115 

  

the actual interestrate risk to torchmark is reduced because the effect that changes in rates have on assets is offset by the effect they have on insurance liabilities and on debt interest assumptions are used to compute the majority of torchmark’s insurance liabilities these insurance liabilities net of deferred acquisition costs were 45 billion and debt was 9 billion at december 31 2004 compared with fixedmaturity investments of 81 billion at amortized cost at the same date because of the longterm nature of insurance liabilities temporary changes in value caused by rate fluctuations have little bearing on ultimate obligations in accordance with gaap insurance liabilities and debt are generally not marked to market 

  

market risk is managed in a manner consistent with torchmark’s investment objectives torchmark seeks to maintain a portfolio of highquality fixedmaturity assets that are available for sale however it is torchmark’s primary objective to hold securities to maturity torchmark’s strong operating cash flow and stable longterm policy liabilities decrease the likelihood of needing to sell fixed investments for operating liquidity some sales may be made to preserve capital due to changes in credit quality of individual securities or for certain business purposes while the lengthening of the fixedmaturity portfolio can result in more periodtoperiod volatility in the fair value of the portfolio torchmark’s objective to generally hold securities to maturity to provide for its longterm liabilities minimizes any real impact of interestrate changes on the company the company expects 35 of the fixed portfolio to be repaid including calls within five years and 51 within ten years 

  

no derivative instruments are used to manage torchmark’s exposure to market risk in the investment portfolio interestrate swap instruments have been entered into by torchmark in connection with its trust preferred stock and certain of its debt issues as discussed in note 12—debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption capital resources in this report 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark’s interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2004 and 2003 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark’s fixedmaturity portfolio the data are prepared through a model which incorporates various assumptions and estimates to measure the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options put options and unscheduled repayments could have on the portfolio given the changes in rates the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 

  

   

realized gains and losses   as a group of life and health insurance carriers torchmark collects premium income from its policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future in addition to the payment of these benefits torchmark also incurs acquisition costs administrative expenses and taxes as a part of its insurance operations because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations for this reason torchmark as a part of its core insurance operations holds a significant investment portfolio this portfolio consists primarily of highquality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these longterm insurance product obligations as a result fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 

  

because torchmark holds this large and diverse investment portfolio investments are occasionally sold or called resulting in a realized gain or loss these gains and losses occur only incidentally usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments torchmark does not engage in trading investments for profit therefore gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which are beyond the control of management are only secondary to torchmark’s core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders unlike investment income they are not considered in determining premium rates or product profitability of torchmark’s insurance products 

  

realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations however and as a result have a material positive or negative impact on net income the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause periodtoperiod trends of net income to not be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations accordingly they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as management views its operations for these reasons torchmark management removes the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating its overall insurance operating results 

  

the following table summarizes torchmark’s taxeffected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2004 

  

analysis of aftertax realized gains losses 

amounts in millions except for per share data 

  

    

in each year torchmark wrote down several individual holdings to estimated fair value as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met some or all of torchmark’s criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in note 3—investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in its critical accounting policies in this report pretax charges for these impairments were 6 million in 2004 15 million in 2003 and 93 million in 2002 of the issuers of bonds written down in 2002 through 2004 the bonds of 3 issuers were still held at december 31 2004 at a fair value of 57 million and a recorded book value of 34 million 

  

accounting rules require torchmark to revalue its interestrate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period the fair values of these instruments fluctuate with interest rates in financial markets and diminish with the passage of time so that their value is zero when they expire torchmark intends to hold its swaps until they expire and has historically done so therefore while periodtoperiod fluctuations can be substantial the value of the swaps and the cumulative unrealized gains and losses from marking the swaps to market value from inception will be zero when the swap agreements expire temporary unrealized changes in swap values are included as a component of “realized investment gains losses” on the consolidated statement of operations this fair value adjustment for all swaps on a pretax basis was a negative 8 million in 2004 a negative 16 million in 2003 and a positive 18 million in 2002 

  

in september 2003 the securities and exchange commission informally interpreted sfas 133 the gaap rules concerning the reporting of nonhedged derivatives their interpretation concluded that all income and expenses related to a nonhedged derivative must be recorded in the same line item on the income statement that the adjustment to fair value is recorded this interpretation was effective immediately with prior periods reclassified accordingly for comparability to comply with this interpretation torchmark combines the cash settlements in interest cost with the noncash unrealized fair value adjustment as a component of realized investment gains and losses therefore torchmark includes the cash settlements on all swap derivatives in realized investment gains and losses torchmark’s pretax interest cost reduction from these cash settlements included in realized investment gains was a positive 23 million in 2004 a positive 26 million in 2003 and a positive 23 million in 2002 torchmark continues to reduce interest cost for this benefit in its segment analysis because the segment analysis is required by gaap to be as management evaluates the performance of the segment torchmark views the benefit from lower interest rates as a reduction in its financing costs in its investment segment 

  

financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations torchmark’s liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations a portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

torchmark’s insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs sources of cash flows from operations include primarily premium and investment income cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments commissions administrative expenses and taxes 

  

operating cash inflows significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers such as torchmark expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods sometimes many years later a liability is actuarially computed and recorded for these future benefits which increases as insurance in force grows so that torchmark can “save” for these future payments earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period but there is no corresponding cash outlay therefore cash provided from operations will generally significantly exceed net income in any given period cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of torchmark’s investment portfolio cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements available cash flows are also used to repay debt to buy back torchmark shares to pay shareholder dividends and for other corporate uses while torchmark’s cash flows have historically been positive and very strong a reduction in cash flow could negatively affect its liquidity 

  

cash flows provided from operations increased in each of the three years ended december 31 2004 over their respective prior year they were 767 million in 2004 740 million in 2003 and 651 million in 2002 in addition torchmark received 574 million in investment maturities and repayments in 2004 adding to available cash flows such repayments were 682 million in 2003 and 304 million in 2002 

  

torchmark has in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 600 million for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility see the commercial paper section of note 12—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  

  

torchmark’s cash and shortterm investments were 99 million at yearend 2004 and 64 million at yearend 2003 additionally torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need these securities had a fair value of 88 billion at december 31 2004 however torchmark’s strong cash flows from operations investment maturities and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 

  

liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet dividend payments on common and preferred stock interest and principal repayment requirements on parentcompany debt and operating expenses of the parent company for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries see the restrictions section of note 13—shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements  although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as fully described and discussed in note 12—debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt  torchmark has outstanding 150 million par amount 7 3  4  trust preferred securities the capital trusts which are liable for these securities are the legal entities which are responsible for the securities and facilitate the payment of dividends to shareholders they are offbalance sheet arrangements which torchmark is required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules deconsolidation is necessary because they are considered to be variable interest entities in which torchmark has no variable interest and is therefore not the primary beneficiary of the entity even though it owns all of the entity’s voting equity while these liabilities are not on torchmark’s balance sheet they are represented by torchmark’s 7 3  4  junior subordinated debentures due to the trusts these junior subordinated debentures are a torchmark 

  

liability of 155 million par and book value at december 31 2004 and are indicated as a capital resource to torchmark under the caption capital resources in this report the 7 3  4  preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by torchmark’s 7 3  4  interest payment on its debt to the trusts as described in note 16—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  torchmark has guaranteed the performance of the capital trusts to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 

  

pension obligations to torchmark’s employees are obligations of trust fund entities which are not reflected on torchmark’s balance sheet the obligations of these trusts are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans these trust entities hold assets which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the pension obligations as they become due 

  

as of december 31 2004 torchmark had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of thirdparty entities all of torchmark’s guarantees other than the trust preferred guarantee were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries as disclosed in note 16—commitments and contingencies all of torchmark’s derivative instruments were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet 

  

the following table presents information about torchmark’s contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december 31 2004 

  

       

   

   

   

   

capital resources    torchmark’s capital structure consists of shortterm debt the commercial paper facility described in note 12—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  longterm funded debt junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities and shareholders’ equity the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark’s capital trusts which are liable for its trust preferred securities in accordance with gaap these instruments are included in “due to affiliates” on the consolidated balance sheet  an analysis of longterm debt issues outstanding is as follows at december 31 2004

the carrying value of torchmark’s 6 1  4  senior notes and its 8 1  4  notes are adjusted each period to reflect the change in fair value of swap instruments which hedge the value of the notes the 6 1  4  note swap instrument increased the value of longterm debt by 57 million and 120 million at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively the 8 1  4  note swap which commenced in august 2004 increased the value of longterm debt 24 million at december 31 2004 

  

  

the carrying value of the funded debt was 695 million at december 31 2004 compared with 698 million a year earlier see note 12—debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information concerning funded debt in connection with these instruments torchmark had in place four interestrate swap agreements at december 31 2004 but also had another swap agreement which expired in september 2004 these agreements exchange torchmark’s fixedrate obligations on the debt instruments to floating rates information about these swaps is also found in the debt note 

  

torchmark maintains a significant availableforsale fixedmaturity portfolio to support its insurance policyholders’ liabilities torchmark is required by an accounting rule sfas 115 to revalue this portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period the periodtoperiod changes in fair value net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity changes in the fair value of the portfolio result from changes in interest rates in financial markets while sfas 115 requires invested assets to be revalued accounting rules do not permit interestbearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner due to the size of torchmark’s policy liabilities in relation to its shareholders’ equity this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact in the reported value of shareholders’ equity if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets the effect on equity would be largely offset fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the periodtoperiod presentation of torchmark’s shareholders’ equity capital structure and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets for this reason torchmark’s management credit rating agencies lenders many industry analysts and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of sfas 115 when analyzing torchmark’s balance sheet capital structure and financial ratios 

  

the following tables present selected data related to torchmark’s capital resources additionally the tables present the effect of sfas 115 on relevant line items so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark’s capital structure 

  

selected financial data 

  

      

torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was 138 times in 2004 compared with 126 times in 2003 and 110 times in 2002 a discussion of torchmark’s interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 

  

as previously mentioned torchmark’s board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the company’s stock repurchase program in 2004 in amounts and timing that management in consultation with the board determined to be in the best interest of the company torchmark has repurchased its common 

  

stock every year since 1986 except for 1995 the year following the acquisition of american income since the beginning of 1998 torchmark has repurchased 348 million shares at a total cost of 13 billion and has acquired no fewer than 34 million shares in any one year management believes that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings return on equity and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value as noted earlier in this report torchmark acquired 52 million shares at a cost of 268 million in 2004 with excess cash flow if the 268 million free cash flow used for the repurchase of torchmark common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds an estimated 61 million of additional investment income after tax would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have increased 11 to 413 because share purchases were made actual net income per share was 419 an increase of 12 torchmark intends to continue the repurchase of its common shares when financial markets are favorable 

  

credit ratings the credit quality of torchmark’s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies during 2003 standard and poor’s upgraded torchmark’s funded debt rating from a to a and its preferred securities rating from bbb to a the chart below presents torchmark’s credit ratings as of december 31 2004 

  

   

the financial strength of torchmark’s major insurance subsidiaries are also rated by standard  poor’s and am best standard and poor’s lowered the insurance financial strength rating of united investors to a from aa noting that united investors was no longer a strategic subsidiary to torchmark also during 2003 a m best upgraded american income’s insurance financial strength rating to a superior from a excellent the following chart presents these ratings for torchmark’s five largest insurance subsidiaries at december 31 2004 

  

   

am best states that it assigns a superior ratings to those companies which in its opinion have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the lifehealth insurance industry a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 

  

the aa rating is assigned by standard  poor’s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics differing only slightly from those rated higher the a rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings the “” indicates that united investors is among the strongest insurers within the a category 

  

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined additionally it should be noted that torchmark subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by management to be material for more information concerning litigation please refer to note 16—commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

new unadopted accounting rules 

  

stock option expensing stock options have been granted to executives employees consultants and directors as a form of compensation to provide motivation and to align the interests of these groups with the same interests of shareholders because they are generally granted at the fair value of torchmark stock at the date of grant the value of these options increases as the value of torchmark stock increases the cost of these options is in the dilution caused by the exercise of the options as the grantees’ ownership of the company grows in relation to existing shareholders this cost has historically been reflected in per share earnings in the financial statements through the increased dilution 

  

in december 2004 the fasb revised statement 123 sharebased payment statement 123r effective for torchmark as of july 1 2005 the provisions of this statement will require torchmark to assign a hypothetical “fair value” to option grants and to recognize an expense in the financial statements for stock options based on this value amortized over the period that the option vests this expense will be deducted from earnings and earnings per share in addition to it already being reflected in the dilution computation described above 

  

the “fair value” method contrasts with the “intrinsic value” method currently permitted by gaap and used by torchmark whereby a value is assigned to an option only if the grant price is less than the fair value of the stock at the date of grant because torchmark’s options are generally granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of torchmark stock torchmark has historically incurred no option expense gaap rules currently require torchmark to disclose in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements the impact on earnings on a pro forma basis as if the “fair value” method were in effect the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to materially alter its methodology of calculating option expense or the results of expensing options to vary materially from the pro forma priorperiod disclosures 

  

while restatement of prior periods is permitted the statement also permits a “modified prospective” method of adoption whereby the expense of all unvested options as of july 1 2005 and options granted after july 1 2005 are expensed in accordance with the statement after that date torchmark will elect the modified prospective method of adoption 

  

the “fair value” assigned to option grants is derived from complex option pricing models using subjective assumptions such as price volatility and expected term considerable judgment is sometimes 

  

involved in the determination of these assumptions which must be made at the time of option grant variations in actual experience versus the assumptions can cause material differences in an option’s actual value when it is ultimately exercised versus its expense recorded in the financial statements additionally popular pricing models do not take into account specific characteristics of employee option grants such as vesting and transferability restrictions they also ignore the concept of mean reversion assigning a higher value to an option when the underlying stock price is historically higher when in reality an option is more valuable when granted at a historically lower price torchmark plans to use the blackscholes pricing model as it has done for the pro forma disclosures with assumptions most reflective of torchmark’s experience 

  

earnings per share as described in note 1—significant accounting policies  diluted earnings per share include the dilution resulting from the potential conversion of dilutive securities such as stock options into torchmark common stock the potential dilution from stock options has traditionally been calculated using the “treasury stock method” required by gaap this method assumes that torchmark uses the funds derived from the assumed exercise of options to buy treasury stock thus reducing the net number of new shares outstanding resulting from the exercise 

  

the issuance by the fasb of statement 123r requiring the expensing of stock options revises the method of computing dilutive shares the revised method does not allow the treasury stock method which simulates cash flow but instead limits cash receipts from the tax benefit and injects hypothetical concepts such as “unrecognized option expense” to the dilution model as a result diluted shares outstanding under the new standard will bear no relationship to diluted shares outstanding under the historical model or to a pattern that the company could actually replicate with its cash flow 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits  because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts torchmark’s insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  while management and company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents torchmark’s ultimate obligation additionally because of the size of this liability significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note 7—future policy benefits reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  

  

deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased  the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales additionally the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption “value of insurance purchased” torchmark’s policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  different assumptions with regard to deferred acquisition costs could produce materially different amounts of amortization for more information about accounting for deferred acquisition costs see note 5—deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to the company however the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation the litigation environment regulatory mandates and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established changes in these estimates if any are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made torchmark management believes that the estimates used to 

  

produce the liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims are the most appropriate under the circumstances however there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be torchmark’s ultimate obligation 

  

revenue recognition premium income for torchmark’s subsidiaries’ insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected however in accordance with gaap revenue on limitedpayment contracts and universal lifetype contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently revenues on limitedpayment contracts are recognized over the contract period premium for deposit balance products such as torchmark’s annuity and interestsensitive life policies is added to the policy account value the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance administration surrender and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder in each case benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 

  

investment income is reported as revenue by torchmark when it is earned less investment expenses the investment activities of torchmark are integral to its insurance operations because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates contract liabilities and other product contract features these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on torchmark’s net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products for more information concerning revenue recognition investment accounting and interest sensitivity please refer to note 1—significant accounting policies and note 3—investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities  investments  and market risk sensitivity in this report 

  

impairment of investments  torchmark continually monitors its investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value while the values of the investments in torchmark’s portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an investment is considered to be impaired only when it has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary the policies and procedures that torchmark uses to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note 1—significant accounting policies and note 3—investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report 

  

while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an otherthantemporary impairment it is difficult to predict the ultimate recoverable amount of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans torchmark maintains funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees it also has unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees torchmark’s obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining torchmark’s obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in torchmark’s pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation these assumptions are subjective in many cases and small changes in certain assumptions may cause material differences in reported results while management has used its best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources no assurance can be given that actual results will be the same as expected the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised if necessary based on more current information available to the company torchmark’s discount rate rate of return on assets and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed in note 11—postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements  this note also contains information about pension plan assets investment policies funded status and other related data

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

to the board of directors and shareholders of 

torchmark corporation 

birmingham alabama 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  that torchmark corporation and subsidiaries “torchmark” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission torchmark’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of torchmark’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that torchmark maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion torchmark maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2004 of torchmark and our report dated march 11 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

for additional financial information about the companys segments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report beginning on page f1 

business strategy 

historically the companys primary business strategy has been to acquire own and operate welllocated underperforming suburban and medical office properties generally located in certain of the current markets at attractive yields and to increase cash flow and property value by implementing a comprehensive operating strategy the companys operating strategy includes i investment in valueenhancing renovation and refurbishment programs ii aggressive leasing efforts iii reduction and containment of operating costs and iv a strong emphasis on tenant services and satisfaction the company seeks to establish itself as one of the suburban and medical office property owneroperators of choice in the current markets and to maximize tenant retention 

historically the company has sought to engage in strategic dispositions of select properties the company typically seeks to dispose of properties when one or more of the following conditions is present i market prices are at or near replacement cost ii property occupancy is high and there is limited potential to increase cash flow and property value within a reasonable period iii the company believes that its capital can be redeployed to investment properties with higher longterm returns and iv ownership of the property is no longer consistent with the companys business strategy the company sold four properties in 2003 aggregating 148000 square feet resulting in net sales proceeds of 146 million the company sold four properties in 2002 aggregating 295000 square feet resulting in net sales proceeds of 331 million in january 2004 the company signed definitive agreements to sell its portfolio of medical office buildings for a contract price of 69 million and its minnesota properties for 42 million the company has identified certain other assets that it expects to market for sale during 2004 and may consider selling additional properties if market conditions warrant the company has not entered into any definitive agreements with respect to any such additional disposition opportunities and there can be no assurances that the company will consummate any such dispositions 

in january 2004 the company entered into a merger agreement with aslan realty partners ii lp an affiliate of transwestern investment company llc transwestern pursuant to the merger agreement transwestern agreed to pay 1498 per share in cash to the companys common shareholders upon the closing of the merger the terms of the merger agreement permit the company to sell certain of its properties including the portfolio of medical office buildings and its properties located at 2550 university avenue w st paul minnesota and 2221 university avenue se minneapolis minnesota on march 5 2004 the company announced that it had completed the sale of its portfolio of medical office properties for a contract price of 69 million and the sale of its property located at 2550 university avenue w st paul minnesota for a contract price of 35 million 

as a result based on the net proceeds from the recently completed sales of the companys portfolio of medical office buildings and its property located at 2550 university avenue w st paul minnesota calculated as of march 5 2004 the companys common shareholders will be entitled to receive 1544 per share in cash upon completion of the merger the merger consideration will be increased automatically if the sale of certain other properties occurs prior to the completion of the merger and those sales provide net proceeds in excess of the applicable agreed value for those properties the company has entered into an agreement to sell its property located at 2221 university avenue se minneapolis minnesota to the university of minnesota for a contract price that would increase the per share contribution payable in the merger by an estimated 011 per common share in addition the company has entered into an agreement to sell its property located at 3550 salt creek lane arlington heights illinois for a contract price that would increase the per share consideration payable in the merger by an estimated 005 per common share assuming that the property located at 2221 university avenue se minneapolis minnesota is sold to the university of minnesota for its contract price and the property located at 3550 salt creek lane arlington heights illinois is sold for its contract price the company estimates that its common shareholders would be entitled to receive 1560 per share in cash upon completion of the merger 

the company has also entered into a separate agreement with fortis asset management relating to its property located at 2221 university avenue se minneapolis minnesota that agreement provides for fortis purchase of this property in the event the sale of the property to the university of minnesota is not consummated if this property is sold to fortis for the price specified in the contract with fortis the per share consideration payable in the merger would be increased by an estimated 008 per common share rather than an estimated 011 per common share 

the amount of any increase in the merger consideration will be equal to each common shares ratable portion of the increase rounded to the nearest whole cent as described in the merger agreement the company will publicly announce any increase in the merger consideration prior to the completion of the merger however there can be no assurance that the company will consummate the sale of its property located at 2221 university avenue se minneapolis minnesota to either the 

university of minnesota or fortis or that it will consummate the sale of its property located at 3550 salt creek lane arlington heights illinois in addition there are no understandings or contracts with respect to any of the other potential sale of properties and there can be no assurance that the company will sell any of those properties 

the proposed merger with transwestern is contingent on shareholder approval and certain other closing conditions but is not contingent on the completion of any of the additional property sales the proposed sales of individual properties are not contingent on one another or the merger and each of the proposed property sale transactions is subject to customary closing conditions the company expects that the property sale transactions currently under contract will close in april 2004 and expects the merger to close in the april or may of 2004 

financing strategy 

the company seeks to maintain a wellbalanced conservative and flexible capital structure by i currently targeting a ratio of longterm debt to total market capitalization in the range of 40 to 60 ii extending and sequencing the maturity dates of its debt iii focusing on borrowing at fixed rates iv pursuing debt financings and refinancing on a secured basis and v maintaining relatively conservative debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios in 2002 the company refinanced its unsecured credit facility with a longterm secured loan the companys ratio of longterm debt to total market capitalization may increase as a result of using secured debt in place of unsecured debt in addition as discussed under item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company has approximately 41 million of borrowing capacity under two secured loans that it may use for shortterm funding of the acquisition of additional properties and for working capital requirements the companys debt to total market capitalization ratio total market capitalization is defined as the total market value of all outstanding common and preferred shares and units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership plus outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2003 was 502 

competition 

all of the properties are located in competitive markets the properties with which the company competes for tenants are generally owned by institutional investors other reits or local real estate operators however no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in any of the current markets in addition the company may be competing with other owners and operators that have greater financial resources and more experience than the company an increase in the supply and a decrease in the demand for rental properties with characteristics similar to those of the properties may adversely affect rental rates or the companys ability to lease space at the properties or any newly acquired properties during 2003 vacancy rates in the current markets generally trended upward due to both increases in the supply and decreases in demand for office space within the current markets the company currently expects that such vacancy rate increases will affect the ability of all property owners within the current markets including the company to increase rental revenues until such time as vacancy rates begin to trend downward 

insurance 

the company carries comprehensive liability casualty pollution extended coverage and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties with policy specifications and insured limits that the company believes are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances there is in 2004 no exclusion in the companys casualty insurance policy for damage caused by acts of terrorism there are however certain types of losses that are not generally insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically feasible to insure should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur the company could lose its capital invested in any of the properties as well as the anticipated future revenues from such property and in the case of recourse debt the company would remain obligated 

for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to such property any such loss would adversely affect the business financial condition and results of operations of the company moreover as the general partner of the operating partnership the company will generally be liable for any of the operating partnerships unsatisfied obligations other than nonrecourse obligations the company believes that the properties are adequately insured however no assurance can be given that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 

environmental regulations 

under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination such laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility the costs of investigation remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination on such property may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of a release of hazardous or toxic substances at such disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred in connection with the contamination finally the owner of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from such site some or all of these costs may not be covered by pollution insurance 

during the last eight years independent environmental consultants have conducted or updated phase i environmental assessments phase i assessments at each of the properties in addition a limitedscope phase ii assessment phase ii assessment has been conducted at the 2221 university avenue se minneapolis minnesota and 777 east eisenhower parkway ann arbor michigan properties the phase i assessments and the phase ii assessments are collectively referred to as the environmental assessments the phase i assessments have included among other things a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding area and a review of relevant state federal and historical documents except for the phase ii assessments and certain limited sampling in connection with underground tank andor piping removals at the 601 campus drive arlington heights illinois and 11270 w park place milwaukee wisconsin properties no invasive techniques such as soil or groundwater sampling were performed at any of the properties the companys environmental assessments of the properties have not revealed any condition giving rise to an environmental liability that the company believes would have a material adverse effect on the companys business assets or results of operations taken as a whole nor is the company otherwise aware of any such condition there can be no assurance however that the companys environmental assessments would reveal all conditions giving rise to environmental liabilities moreover there can be no assurance that i future laws ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or ii the current environmental condition of the properties will not be affected by tenants the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the properties such as the presence of underground storage tanks or third parties unrelated to the company

leases often contain provisions permitting tenants to renew at prevailing market rates certain leases contain provisions that permit the tenant to terminate its lease upon written notice to the company subject to the tenants obligation to pay a termination penalty such termination penalties are generally negotiated with a tenant when a lease is executed and are usually calculated to compensate the company for unamortized tenant improvements and leasing commissions at the termination date and in certain instances for rent on the space for a period of months after the termination date

 item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands 

the companys interest income is sensitive to changes in the general levels of us shortterm interest rates 

the companys interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us shortterm and longterm interest rates as the company has outstanding indebtedness at fixed and variable rates a change in variable interest rates of 1 per annum would increase or decrease the companys interest expense by 413 per annum based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at december 31 2003 41306 

as of december 31 2003 a portion of the companys longterm debt bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus 135 the company is a party to a swap agreement that effectively fixes the interest rate on 25000 this debt at a maximum of 488 per annum until december 2004 

at december 31 2003 the company had 267641 of fixed rate debt outstanding at an average rate of 589 including the effect of the swap agreement the company has longterm debt outstanding at fixed rates in the range of 43 to 744 the general level of interest rates in the united states as of february 1 2004 is such that refinancing this debt at current rates would be unlikely due to prepayment restrictions and penalties on its fixed rate debt if the general level of interest rates in the united states were to fall further the company would not likely have the opportunity to refinance this fixed rate debt at lower interest rates due to prepayment restrictions and penalties on its fixed rate debt 

in general the company believes longterm fixed rate debt is preferable as a financing vehicle for its operations due to the longterm fixed contractual rental income the company receives from its tenants as a result the company has 87 of its longterm debt outstanding at december 31 2003 at fixed rates including the debt affected by the swap agreement the company may as market conditions warrant enter into additional fixed rate longterm debt instruments on either a secured or unsecured basis

torchmark subsidiaries distribute life insurance through a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and noncommissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 

  

pricing 

  

premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses all of which are generally based on the experience of each insurance subsidiary and on projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual experience deviates from that which has been assumed in premium pricing and to the extent investment income exceeds that which is required for policy reserves 

  

collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policy accounts 

  

underwriting 

  

the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management each company uses information from the application and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports doctors’ statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected 

  

for life insurance in excess of certain prescribed amounts each insurance company requires medical information or examinations of applicants these are graduated according to the age of the applicant and may vary with the kind of insurance except for the use of information from the medical information bureau generally the maximum amount of insurance issued without additional medical information is 100000 through age 50 in certain circumstances the maximum amount is raised to 250000 through age 35 additional medical information is requested of all applicants regardless of age or amount if information obtained from the application or other sources indicates that such information is warranted 

  

reinsurance 

  

as is customary among insurance companies torchmark insurance subsidiaries cede insurance to other unaffiliated insurance companies on policies issued they issue in excess of retention limits in the event insurance business is ceded the torchmark insurance subsidiaries remain contingently liable with respect to ceded insurance should any reinsurer be unable to meet the obligations it assumes  see note 18—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 75 and schedule iv—reinsurance consolidated on page 102 

  

reserves 

  

the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap these reserves with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries since 

  

these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis a list of the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmark’s reserves are reported in the financial statements  see note 7—future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 62 reserves for annuity products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credits and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments

torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and sales efforts in addition to competition with other insurance companies torchmark faces competition from other financial services organizations while there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company dominates any of torchmark’s life or health markets 

  

torchmark’s health insurance products compete with in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations preferred provider organizations and other health carerelated institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 

  

torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies allowing torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining underwriting margins in the case of medicare supplement business having low expense levels is necessary in order to meet federally mandated loss ratios and achieve the desired underwriting margins torchmark’s years of experience in the direct response business are a valuable asset in implementing direct response marketing operations 

  

regulation 

  

insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements determining the form and content of required financial statements and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted insurance companies can also be required under the solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business to pay assessments up to prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies they are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the rules of the naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies 

  

risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all of the insurance subsidiaries of torchmark are adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula 

  

guaranty assessments state guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies into a fund which is used in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened legal proceedings these lawsuits involve tax matters alleged breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmark’s subsidiaries employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action many of these lawsuits involve claims for punitive damages in state courts of alabama a jurisdiction particularly recognized for its large punitive damage verdicts a number of such actions involving liberty also name torchmark as a defendant in 1999 alabama enacted legislation limiting punitive damages in nonphysical injury cases to the greater of 500000 or three times compensatory damages since this legislation has not undergone scrutiny by appellate courts regarding its constitutionality and a jury’s discretion regarding the amount of compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded in any given case is not precisely defined the effect of this legislation on torchmark’s litigation remains unclear additionally it should be noted that torchmark subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi a jurisdiction which is recognized nationally for large punitive damage verdicts bespeaking caution is the fact that the likelihood 

  

or extent of a punitive damage award in any given case is currently impossible to predict as of december 31 2002 liberty was a party to approximately 93 active lawsuits including 9 employment related cases and excluding interpleaders and stayed cases 69 of which were alabama proceedings and 9 of which were mississippi proceedings in which punitive damages were sought liberty faces trial settings in these cases on an ongoing basis 

  

based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by management to be material it should be noted however that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark has substantial business particularly alabama and mississippi continue to occur creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit 

  

as previously reported liberty was served on october 28 1999 with a subpoena from the florida department of insurance in connection with that department’s investigation into liberty’s sales practices and disclosures in the state of florida regarding industrial life insurance and low coverage life insurance policies liberty has also received similar subpoenas from the alabama georgia kentucky texas south carolina and minnesota insurance departments regarding its industrial life insurance and other low faceamount life insurance policies sold in those states specific inquiry is made into the historical use of racedistinct mortality in the design or pricing of industrial insurance a practice believed to be actuarially sound but nevertheless discontinued by liberty many years ago in 1988 liberty endeavored to convert to paidup status those policies utilizing racedistinct mortality that remained in premiumpaying status at that time liberty has been and continues responding to these subpoenas in a timely fashion in july 2000 the florida and georgia insurance departments issued cease and desist orders to all companies reporting premium income from industrial life insurance including liberty stating that to the extent that any company is currently collecting any racedistinct insurance premiums from florida and georgia residents respectively it immediately cease and desist from collecting any premium differential based on the race of the policyholders upon receiving the georgia order liberty informed the georgia insurance department that liberty did not interpret the georgia department’s directive as a cease and desist order since it did not afford liberty the opportunity for a mandatory or voluntarily requested hearing thereunder on august 22 2000 the florida district court of appeals issued an order staying the florida insurance department’s immediate final cease and desist order pending appeals to the florida supreme court the florida supreme court subsequently reversed and rendered the district court of appeals’ order and thus declared the cease and desist order null and void liberty as an alabama domestic company was examined by representatives of the alabama department of insurance with regard to issues parallel to those raised by the state of florida by order dated january 28 2002 the alabama department finalized a report of its examination of liberty the report has now been turned over to the alabama department’s legal division for further consideration

review and approval of the transaction by all independent and disinterested members of the torchmark board of directors the transaction was procedurally and substantively unfair to torchmark and resulted from the breach of fiduciary duties of loyalty owed to torchmark by two of the above described individual defendants and the knowing participation of the third individual defendant in the alleged breach of fiduciary duty establishment of a constructive trust for such assets for the benefit of torchmark and its shareholders an accounting for profits and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages were sought the request for establishment of a constructive trust was subsequently deleted by the plaintiff

on october 3 2002 the circuit court entered an order granting motions for summary judgment in favor of all defendants in bomar  the circuit court stated in its order that demand on the torchmark board of directors by the plaintiff was not excused that a majority of the board and all members of the special litigation committee were independent and disinterested that the special litigation committee conducted its investigation thoroughly and in good faith that the special litigation committee’s findings and conclusion that the bomar action should be dismissed and that the real estate transaction in question was well within the scope of the business judgment rule was correct and such findings were adopted by the circuit court and that the special litigation committee’s conclusion that the transaction “was entirely fair to torchmark” was fully supported by the record and the law on november 13 2002 the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the alabama supreme court of the circuit court’s order 

  

on september 12 2002 a trial court jury in chambers county alabama circuit court returned a 32 million verdict against liberty in ingram v liberty national life insurance company civil action no cv9662 this case originally filed in march 1996 alleged that the plaintiff purchased an interestsensitive life insurance policy from liberty based upon agent representations that premiums on the policy would be due for ten years and thereafter it would have paidup policy status plaintiff asserted fraud misrepresentation of material facts suppression deceit fraudulent deceit wanton or intentional conduct civil conspiracy wanton hiring retention supervision of agents bad faith and conversion since the policy did not reach paidup status at the end of the ten years of premium payments the plaintiff had sought a declaratory judgment and compensatory and punitive damages in the circuit court liberty has pursued all available post judgment motions and will pursue appellate relief on january 29 2003 the circuit court denied liberty’s motion for a new trial and ordered the 32 million verdict reduced to 240000

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 

  

  

results of operations 

  

summary of operating results torchmark’s management computes a classification of income called “net operating income” that it has used consistently over time to evaluate the operating performance of the company net operating income is also the corresponding aftertax sum of the pretax measures of profit or loss for each of torchmark’s reportable segments required to be disclosed in accordance with gaap  see note 19 business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  torchmark’s core operations are segmented into insurance underwriting operations and investment operations insurance underwriting operations are further segmented into life insurance health insurance and annuity products the measure of profitability for its insurance segments is underwriting income before other income and administrative expense this represents the gross profit margin on insurance products before administrative expenses this measure of underwriting income is computed as premium income less net policy obligations commissions and acquisition expenses insurance segments are further subdivided into component distribution channels which are also evaluated by underwriting income the measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income excess investment income represents the earnings on the investment portfolio less the interest required to service net policy liabilities and less the financing costs associated with torchmark’s debt and preferred securities 

  

these designated measures of profitability are highly useful to management in evaluating the performance of the segments and the underlying marketing groups within each insurance segment these measures enable management to view periodtoperiod trends which are helpful in the determination of future courses of action to be taken since net operating income is basically a composite of the results of these operating units it is a valuable aid to management and to investors in evaluating total corporate trends and performance net operating income and other measurements of segment profitability along with associated ratios are also used in determining a portion of executive management compensation 

  

net operating income differs from net income as reported on the income statement because it excludes certain nonoperating items nonrecurring items and discontinued operations which must be recorded in the gaap income statement these nonoperating items sometimes cause distorted comparisons with prior year results if only net income is considered and financial statements are not taken as a whole 

  

the differences between net income as reported in torchmark’s financial statements and net operating income are as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

net realized investment losses were 62 million in 2002 compared with 2 million in 2001 and 5 million in 2000 a component of realized investment losses is the gain or loss from adjusting torchmark’s interest rate swaps to fair market value at the end of each accounting period as required by accounting rules the market value adjustments resulted in pretax gains in each of the three years as 

  

follows 2002 18 million 2001 5 million and 2000 8 million during 2002 torchmark wrote down 89 million in fixed maturities due to impairments for more information regarding these writedowns and torchmark’s policies for evaluating otherthantemporary impairments see the discussions of investments on page 28 of this report and critical accounting policies on page 41 

  

torchmark does not consider realized investment gains and losses a component of its core operations and accordingly they are not a component of net operating income fixed maturities which comprise 92 of the investment portfolio are generally held to maturity but are sometimes sold because of deteriorating credit quality for tax purposes or other reasons these sales result in gains and losses which can be significant in relation to torchmark’s core earnings torchmark’s core insurance business is very longterm in nature with the realization of actual profits emerging over many years including investment gains and losses in net operating income could distort the operating trends 

  

the charge related to previously discontinued energy operations arose from litigation which was ongoing at the time of torchmark’s divestiture of energy activities in 1996 this litigation was settled during 2001 and resulted in the charge more information concerning this matter is found in note 18—commitments and contingencies beginning on page 75 of this report 

  

effective january 1 2002 torchmark adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142—goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142  this statement prohibits goodwill amortization after 2001 but does not allow the restatement of prior periods for comparability when goodwill has been amortized instead after adoption companies are required to consider goodwill for impairment under a set of guidelines described in the statement torchmark tested its goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 and determined that goodwill was not impaired therefore torchmark’s unamortized goodwill balance at december 31 2001 in the amount of 378 million was unchanged in 2002 in order to compare operating performance in prior periods with 2002 torchmark has restated net operating income in 2001 and 2000 to remove the effect of goodwill amortization the goodwill amortization charge was 12 million in both 2001 and 2000 see note 1—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

the redemption of torchmark’s debt and mips are discussed under the caption capital resources beginning on page 34 of this report because of torchmark’s adoption in 2003 of statement of financial accounting standards no 145 sfas 145 which amends certain previously issued accounting rules torchmark will include gains and losses on the redemption of its debt and preferred securities as a component of realized gains and losses in future income statements prior periods will be restated for comparability 

  

the change in accounting principle is discussed in note 11—change in accounting principle in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 65 of this report

on a per share basis torchmark’s net operating income grew 9 in both 2002 and 2001 to 351 in 2002 and 321 in 2001 torchmark’s net operating income rose 5 in 2002 to 424 million and 7 in 2001 to 405 million per share growth exceeded growth in total net operating income for both periods as a result of share buybacks insurance underwriting income grew 3 in 2001 to 368 million but declined 2 to 359 million in 2002 a complete discussion of torchmark’s insurance operations is found in the discussions of insurance segments beginning on page 19 of this report excess investment income grew in both periods the 13 increase in 2001 excess investment income was due primarily to the decrease in financing costs resulting from the lower interest rate environment in 2001 and debt refinancings during the year excess investment income rose an additional 15 in 2002 as a result of the continued benefit from the lowerinterest environment and its favorable impact on financing costs from torchmark’s interest rate swaps refer to the discussion of investments on page 28 and capital resources on page 34 of this report 

  

torchmark’s total revenues were 274 billion in 2002 a 1 increase over 2001 revenues of 271 billion revenues rose 8 in 2001 over 2000 revenues of 252 billion after adjustment for realized investment losses in each year revenues grew 3 to 280 billion in 2002 from 271 billion in 2001 they increased 7 in 2001 over the prior year total premium rose 3 to 228 billion in 2002 total premium increased 8 in 2001 to 222 billion life insurance premium grew 7 in 2002 to 122 billion an increase of 76 million health premium in 2002 rose 1 to 102 billion net investment income increased 27 million or 5 in 2002 to 519 million life premium increased 6 to 114 billion and health premium grew 11 to 101 billion in 2001 net investment income rose 4 in 2001 to 492 million 

  

other operating expenses were 135 million in 2002 compared with 129 million in 2001 and 121 million in 2000 these expenses as a percentage of revenues excluding realized losses were 48 in each of the years 2002 2001 and 2000 the largest component of other operating expenses insurance administrative expenses were 125 million in 2002 increasing 5 over 2001 expenses of 

  

119 million insurance administrative expenses rose 6 in 2001 as a percentage of premium administrative expense has been stable in each of the past three years at 55 54 and 55 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the components of torchmark’s revenues and operations are described in more detail in the following discussion of insurance and investment segments 

  

life insurance life insurance is torchmark’s largest segment in 2002 life premium represented 54 of total premium and life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 62 of the total 

  

life insurance premium rose 7 in 2002 to 122 billion from 114 billion in 2001 life premium increased 6 in 2001 from 108 billion sales of life insurance in terms of annualized premium were 334 million in 2002 increasing 13 over 2001 sales of 295 million this compares with 1 growth in 2001 sales over 2000 sales of 291 million annualized life premium in force is often indicative of future premium income over the near term annualized life premium in force was 134 billion at december 31 2002 compared with 126 billion at 2001 year end an increase of 7 annualized life premium in force grew 5 in 2001 from 120 billion at yearend 2000 annualized life premium in force and issued data includes amounts collected on certain interestsensitive life products which are not recorded as premium income but excludes singlepremium income and policy account charges

direct response marketing is conducted primarily through direct mail but also through coop mailings television and consumer magazine advertising and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups unions and associations direct response markets a line of life products primarily to juveniles their parents and other adults over age 50 the direct response operation accounted for almost 26 of torchmark’s life insurance premium during 2002 direct response life premium rose 9 in 2002 to 316 million direct response life premium was 289 million in 2001 increasing 8 over 2000 premium of 268 million 

  

direct response annualized life premium in force rose 10 to 357 million at december 31 2002 from 326 million a year earlier at december 31 2002 direct response life annualized premium in force was 27 of torchmark’s total the largest of any component distribution group direct response life insurance annualized premium in force grew 7 in 2001 from 306 million 

  

sales of life insurance in terms of annualized premium issued by direct response were 123 million in 2002 an increase of 10 sales declined slightly in 2001 to 112 million from 113 million in 2000 in early 2001 torchmark discontinued certain products in the direct response market in order to focus on sales of more profitable business the discontinuance of sales of these products resulted in the flattening of 2001 sales the annualized life premium issued by direct response represented 37 of torchmark’s total life sales in 2002 

  

the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets primarily to middleincome markets in several southeastern states liberty’s life premium rose 2 in 2002 to 302 million representing 25 of torchmark’s total life premium life premium in 2001 was 297 million an increase of 1 over the prior year the annualized life premium in force at the liberty agency was 319 million at yearend 2002 compared with 315 million and 312 million at yearends 2001 and 2000 respectively liberty represented 24 of torchmark’s total life annualized premium in force at december 31 2002 compared with 25 a year earlier life premium sales for this agency in terms of annualized premium issued grew 3 during 2002 to 56 million compared with 2 growth in 2001 sales growth in the liberty agency is largely attributable to growth in the number of agents liberty’s agent count rose 2 to 2203 at yearend 2002 after having increased 6 in 2001 to 2162 management believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to the continued growth of sales in controlled agency distribution systems 

  

the american income exclusive agency focuses on members of labor unions credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios this agency was torchmark’s fastest growing agency during both 2002 and 2001 accounting for the largest growth in both life sales and annualized life premium in force annualized life premium in force was 302 million at yearend 2002 an increase of 14 over 2001 premium in force of 266 million annualized life premium in force rose 8 in 2001 sales in terms of annualized premium issued rose 38 in 2002 to 92 million compared with an increase of 17 in 2001 to 66 million the rapid growth in sales for this agency over the last three years was a result of the growth in the number of agents this agency has grown steadily since 1999 the agent count rose 13 in 2000 to 1352 agents at year end grew 31 in 2001 to 1768 agents and further grew to 1975 agents at yearend 2002 american income’s marketing organization continues to implement efforts to improve agent recruiting retention and productivity in order to increase the size of this agency at december 31 2002 american income’s annualized life premium in force was 22 of torchmark’s total compared with 21 at the end of the previous year the american income agency contributed 277 million of life insurance premium income during 2002 an increase of 12 over 2001 premium of 247 million life premium rose 7 in 2001 over the prior year 

  

torchmark’s military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and noncommissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates the military agency represented approximately 12 of torchmark’s life premium in 2002 and life premium in force at december 31 2002 premium rose 11 in 2002 to 149 million after an increase of 13 to 133 million in 2001 annualized premium in force grew 12 to 159 million at yearend 2002 compared to an increase of 12 in the prior year a major factor in the growth of premium income and premium in force in the military agency is the high persistency associated with military business annualized premium issued increased 11 to 23 million in 2002 after having advanced 7 to 21 million in 2001 

  

  

the united american independent and branch office agencies together represented about 6 of torchmark’s total life annualized premium in force in 2002 on a combined basis life premium income rose 5 to 70 million in 2002 life premium rose 8 in 2001 to 67 million from 62 million annualized life premium issued in 2002 was 31 million compared with 29 million in 2001 and 30 million in 2000 annualized life premium in force rose 5 in 2002 to 79 million but was flat in 2001 with the prior year at 75 million 

  

torchmark’s other life insurance distribution system consists of the united investors agency and other small miscellaneous sales agencies the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies prior to 2001 united investors’ distribution was primarily through the sales representatives of a former torchmark subsidiary waddell  reed torchmark spun off waddell  reed in 1998 and united investors terminated the waddell  reed agency contract in 2001 life premium income from the other distribution category declined 4 to 107 million in 2002 but increased 3 to 111 million in 2001 life premium income from the other distribution group accounted for less than 9 of torchmark’s total life insurance premium income in the year 2002 annualized life premium in force declined 5 in 2002 to 127 million after having declined 1 to 134 million in 2001 annualized premium sold during 2002 in the other distribution category was 8 million a drop of 28 in 2002 sales by this agency also declined in 2001 by 38 from 17 million in 2000 to 11 million 

  

in addition to life insurance sales this distribution system has also engaged in the production of variable life collections in 2002 collections were 30 million compared with 2001 collections of 34 million a decline of 11 in 2001 these collections had previously declined 18 from the prior year although variable life collections are not included in premium in force data they are included in the variable life account balance indirectly they add to premium revenue through charges to the variable life account balance for insurance coverage and administration the account balance is affected by fluctuations in financial markets because equity markets were weak in 2002 and 2001 the variable life account balance was negatively impacted in both periods at december 31 2002 the variable life account balance was 119 million declining 19 from the prioryear balance of 147 million the following table summarizes selected variable life insurance information

premium for the health insurance segment increased 1 to 102 billion in 2002 it rose 11 to 101 billion in 2001 and 10 to 911 million in 2000 annualized health premium in force declined 1 to 103 billion at december 31 2002 over the previous yearend balance of 104 billion health premium in force rose 4 in 2001 and 14 during 2000 sales of health insurance in terms of annualized premium issued declined 5 in 2002 to 202 million in 2001 health sales declined 16 from 252 million to 213 million the declines in health sales were attributable to declines in medicare supplement sales in both periods 

  

medicare supplement sales in terms of annualized premium issued fell 37 in 2002 to 99 million from 159 million in 2001 in 2001 medicare supplement sales were down 21 from 201 million the prior year there were three major factors which contributed to these declines first sales in recent years prior to 2001 were positively affected by the involuntary terminations of medicare hmo members which resulted in the disenrollees returning to traditional medicare and medicare supplements in 2000 the number of disenrollees reached an unprecedented level in 2001 however these terminations were approximately half of those of the prior year in 2002 terminations continued to decline the second factor was that medicare supplement sales faced increased premium rate pressure from competition in some markets torchmark implemented premium rate increases on its medicare supplement policies on a more timely basis than some competitors during these periods management believes that these competitive pressures will subside as competitors obtain necessary rate increases torchmark plans to seek lower rate increases in 2003 than in recent years on this business which may improve its competitive position third in addition to the increased competition the number of producing agents at the united american branch office agency declined in 2001 as agents in some markets left for easier sales at those competitors whose medicare supplement products were priced lower than torchmark’s prior to 2001 this agency had experienced rapid growth in appointed agents which contributed greatly to the growth in sales in these periods 

  

medicare supplement policies are highly regulated at both the federal and state levels with standardized benefit plans limits on first year agent compensation and mandated minimum loss ratios however they remain a popular supplemental health policy with the country’s large and growing group of medicare beneficiaries about 85 of all medicare beneficiaries have medicare supplements to cover at least some portion of the deductibles and coinsurance for which the federal medicare program does not pay because of loss ratio regulation underwriting margins on medicare supplements are lower than those on torchmark’s life business however due to united american’s low cost serviceoriented customer service and claims administration as well as its economies of scale it is a profitable line of business 

  

other regulatory issues continue to affect the medicare supplement market medical cost inflation and changes to the medicare program necessitate annual rate increases which generally require state insurance department approval in addition congress and the executive branch have begun studying ways to restructure the medicare program therefore it is likely that changes will be made to the medicare program at sometime in the future however it appears that there will continue to be an important role for private insurers in helping senior citizens cover their healthcare costs as a result medicare supplements should continue as a popular product for seniorage consumers 

  

medicare supplement insurance is sold primarily by the united american branch office agency and the united american independent agency medicare supplement sales in both agencies have declined in both 2001 and 2002 as a result of the decline in hmo disenrollees the increased competition and the loss in the number of agents at the end of 2001 the number of producing agents was 1644 and declined to 1280 at yearend 2002 in terms of annualized health premium issued health sales for the branch office agency were 75 million in 2002 declining 35 from sales of 116 million in 2001 health sales in 2001 declined 20 from sales of 145 million in 2000 the independent agency sold 85 million 74 million and 96 million in each of the years 2000 2001 and 2002 respectively this represents a decline of 14 in 2001 but an increase of 31 in 2002 while medicare supplement sales in this agency declined in 2002 increases in sales of other limitedbenefit health products as discussed below have more than offset the declines 

  

  

cancer insurance premium in force rose 2 in 2002 to 173 million it was flat in 2001 with premium in force of 169 million in both 2001 and 2000 sales of this product were up 9 in 2002 to 12 million sales rose 7 in 2001 to 11 million from 10 million a portion of the growth in cancer annualized premium in force has been attributable to premium rate increases to offset increased health care costs cancer insurance products are sold primarily by the liberty national exclusive agency this agency represented 85 of torchmark’s total cancer annualized premium in force at december 31 2002 

  

sales of other limitedbenefit health products more than doubled in 2002 increasing from 44 million in 2001 to 91 million in 2002 sales of these products previously increased 7 in 2001 over the prior year annualized premium in force for other health products grew 28 in 2002 to 144 million after rising 6 in 2001 to 112 million the united american agencies have offered limited benefit plans for many years the majority of the recent increases in sales were written by the united american independent agency most of the plans being written are limited benefit hospital and surgical plans that are lower cost alternatives to individual major medical plans or that are bought to supplement employersponsored group health plans increased demand for these plans is the result of the growing unavailability of individual major medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers because of the limits on maximum benefits and other limits these type plans are less subject to high rate increases that have been experienced in major medical type plans from a regulatory standpoint these type plans generally require lower minimum loss ratios than medicare supplements but they do experience slightly higher lapse rates

health insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expense declined 3 in 2002 from 173 million to 167 million in 2001 health underwriting income rose 8 from 161 million in 2000 as a percentage of premium underwriting income before other income and administrative expense declined in both 2002 and 2001 from their respective prior years the decreases in margins were caused primarily by increased policy obligations in a closed block of cancer policies and slightly higher acquisition costs in the united american agencies 

  

  

annuities annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis fixed annuity deposits are held and invested by torchmark and are obligations of the company variable annuity deposits are invested at the policyholder’s direction into his choice among a variety of mutual funds which vary in degree of investment risk and return a fixed annuity investment account is also available as a variable annuity investment option investments pertaining to variable annuity deposits are reported as “separate account assets” and the corresponding deposit balances for variable annuities are reported as “separate account liabilities” 

  

annuity products are marketed by torchmark to service a variety of needs including retirement income and longterm taxdeferred growth opportunities prior to 2001 torchmark’s annuities were sold primarily by the waddell  reed sales force which marketed united investors’ products under a marketing agreement in 2000 this sales force collected 96 of torchmark’s total annuity collections effective april 30 2001 torchmark terminated the marketing agreement providing for the sale of torchmark’s variable annuities by the waddell  reed sales force waddell  reed was a former subsidiary of torchmark which was spun off in 1998 but is no longer affiliated in addition to no longer marketing united investors’ products waddell  reed has been replacing united investors’ products with those of another carrier as a result torchmark has experienced declines in annuity sales and deposit balances 

  

on march 19 2002 an alabama jury awarded united investors 50 million in compensatory damages against waddell  reed the dispute resulting in the litigation arose regarding certain compensation on united investors’ inforce block of variable annuities and alleged a scheme by waddell  reed to improperly replace united investors’ variable annuities with those of another company on june 25 2002 an order was issued by the jefferson county alabama circuit court entering the jury verdict interest on the 50 million award will accrue at an annual rate of 12 from june 25 2002 until the date paid waddell  reed has appealed the circuit court’s decision to the alabama supreme court in october 2002 the alabama supreme court affirmed the dismissal of counterclaims against torchmark and an individual defendant but waddell  reed’s appeal from the jury verdict and trial court judgment remains pending united investors will not record the award or the related accrued interest as income until it is received which will not occur until all appeals are completed in addition united investors’ request for injunctive relief to prohibit future improper policy replacements by waddell  reed was denied by the circuit court which specified that united investors has the right to bring additional litigation against waddell  reed 

  

torchmark is now marketing the variable annuities of united investors through other brokerdealers in addition a small amount of fixed annuities are sold by the united american independent agency and the liberty national agency while torchmark continues to sell annuity products it does not expect to emphasize this product line in the future 

  

annuity premium is added to the annuity account balance as a deposit and is not reflected in income revenues on both fixed and variable annuities are derived from charges to the annuity account balances for insurance risk administration and surrender depending on the structure of the contract variable accounts are also charged an investment fee and a sales charge torchmark benefits to the extent these policy charges exceed actual costs and on fixed annuity policies to the extent actual investment income exceeds the investment income which is credited to the policy 

  

the following table presents the annuity account balance at each year end and the annuity collections for each year for both fixed and variable annuities 

  

   

  

collections of fixed annuity premium almost doubled in 2002 at 65 million compared with 33 million in 2001 fixed annuity premium collections declined 20 in 2001 from 42 million in 2000 the fixed annuity deposit balance rose 3 to 628 million at yearend 2002 from 610 million at yearend 2001 this increase reversed the decline of 8 in 2001 to 610 million at year end from 662 million at yearend 2000 during 2000 and 2001 torchmark had experienced weaker sales as a result of the reduced sales force and its reduced emphasis of annuity products in 2002 weaker financial markets caused increased customer interest in fixed annuities and resulted in some transfers of variable annuity customers to fixed products 

  

variable annuity collections declined 77 in 2002 to 26 million from 112 million in 2001 variable collections had previously declined 82 from 608 million in 2000 the variable annuity account balance declined 35 in 2002 to 15 billion at december 31 2002 from 24 billion at december 31 2001 it declined 34 in 2001 from 36 billion at december 31 2000 the loss of the waddell  reed sales force the replacement activity by waddell  reed and the weaker financial markets have been major factors in the declines in variable annuity sales and the variable annuity deposit balance in both 2002 and 2001 variable accounts are valued based on the market values of the underlying securities

annuity underwriting income before other income and administrative expense declined from 26 million in 2001 to 15 million in 2002 it declined 17 from 31 million in 2000 the declines in annuity underwriting income resulted from the declines in the annuity account balance in each period policy charges rose 13 in 2001 to 60 million before dropping 35 in 2002 to 39 million policy charges are generally based on the size of the annuity account balance in 2001 policy charges increased despite declining account balances because of surrender charges generated by the waddell  reed replacement activity however the replacements caused an increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs which reduced 2001 underwriting income the reduced variable annuity sales and replacement activity continued in 2002 and along with the weaker financial markets resulted in the lower variable annuity account size and overall lower annuity underwriting income 

  

  

investments the following table summarizes torchmark’s investment income and excess investment income 

  

analysis of excess investment income 

dollar amounts in thousands except for per share data 

  

   

excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations and cash flow management it is the measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the investment segment it is defined as net investment income on a taxequivalent basis reduced by the interest cost credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or “financing costs” 

  

net investment income rose 5 to 519 million in 2002 in 2001 net investment income increased 4 to 492 million after having increased 6 in 2000 on a taxequivalent basis in which the yield on taxexempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities investment income rose 5 in 2002 taxequivalent investment income rose 3 in 2001 and increased 5 in 2000 the increase in both 2002 and 2001 was caused by the growth in mean invested assets which rose 5 during each year to 69 billion in 2001 and 73 billion in 2002 mean invested assets are computed on the basis of book value the average taxequivalent yield on the portfolio stabilized in 2002 at 716 the average yield declined approximately 14 basis points during 2001 to 717 from 731 since rates have generally declined on investments acquired during this period this decline in yield partially offset the benefit to net investment income from the larger asset base in 2001 the growth in mean invested assets was achieved in both 2002 and 2001 even though 182 million and 159 million were used to buy back torchmark stock under its ongoing share repurchase program in 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

new cash flow was invested primarily in taxable fixedmaturity securities in both 2002 and 2001 these securities consisted primarily of investmentgrade corporate bonds and trust preferred securities as a result the mean taxable fixedmaturity balance has grown in each year rising 8 in 2001 to 61 billion and 7 in 2002 to 66 billion 

  

excess investment income grew 15 in 2002 to 295 million it previously increased 13 in 2001 and 5 in 2000 because excess investment income is a measure of the efficient use of cash flow and cash has been used for share purchases excess investment income should be viewed on a per share basis excess investment income per diluted share increased 20 in 2002 to 244 per share it increased 15 in 2001 and 10 in 2000 the growth in excess investment income in both 2002 and 2001 resulted in large part from the reductions in financing costs through the lower interest rate environment and the redemption of the mips during 2001 in 2002 torchmark reduced financing costs by 23 million through the swap agreements on its debt and preferred security instruments accounting for the majority of the growth in excess investment income these agreements reduced financing costs by 8 million in 2001 

  

  

it is torchmark’s investment strategy to maintain a positive spread between yields on new investments and the company’s required yield on policy and financing costs to accomplish this the company invests new cash primarily in corporate investmentgrade quality fixedmaturity bonds in periods of lower than historically normal interest rates such as experienced in recent years torchmark maintained its yield spread by purchasing longer maturities because the majority of torchmark’s liabilities are its policy liabilities which have fixed interest rates and are very longterm torchmark does not experience negative asset and liability matching by extending investment maturities torchmark’s 2002 investment results indicate this strategy is effective even in periods of low rates but the company expects to benefit as rates eventually rebound funds generated annually from insurance operations as well as those from the investment portfolio exceed the total of floating rate liabilities and reinvestment at higher rates should result in a positive benefit to excess investment income 

  

in 2002 new investments in fixed maturities totaled 12 billion compared with 15 billion in 2001 and 11 billion in 2000 while principal and interest available for commitment are rather stable investments from year to year can fluctuate due to the extent of tax driven sales or infrequently from portfolio restructurings acquisitions in 2002 were made at an effective compounded yield of 753 compared with an effective compounded yield of 749 in 2001 and 807 in 2000 these yields equate to nominal yields on acquisition of 739 735 and 787 in those years respectively acquisitions in 2002 had an average life of 137 years little changed from 114 years in 2001 and higher than 76 years in 2000 

  

at the close of 2002 the fixedmaturity portfolio had a taxequivalent book yield of 743 virtually the same as the 744 portfolio yield of the previous year and slightly less than 750 at the end of 2000 the portfolio average life increased to 96 years at yearend 2002 compared with 94 years at the end of 2001 both yield and average life calculations are based on the maturity date or for callable bonds the call or the maturity date whichever produces the lowest yield yield to worst 

  

at december 31 2002 approximately 92 of invested assets were held in fixedmaturity securities the major rating agencies considered approximately 92 of the portfolio to be investment grade the average quality of the portfolio continues to be “a” the investment strategy of the company is to purchase only investmentgrade obligations the increase in below investmentgrade issues were the result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

  

during 2002 torchmark wrote down several individual holdings to estimated fair value as a result of otherthantemporary impairment the impaired securities met some or all of torchmark’s criteria for otherthantemporary impairment as discussed in its critical accounting policies on page 41 of this report in total eleven individual issues with combined book values of 121 million were written down to 32 million creating a pretax charge of 89 million bonds of eight of the issuers were held at year end five of these issuers were delinquent in interest payments the writedown was partially offset by net realized gains of 13 million on other investments an analysis of the 2002 writedowns by industry sector at the date of writedown is as follows 

  

   

  

at the end of 2002 the fixedmaturity portfolio had a book value of 69 billion and fair market value of 72 billion for an unrealized gain of 306 million this compares with an unrealized loss of 18 million at the end of 2001 the increase in unrealized gain in 2002 resulted primarily from the decline in rates in financial markets however gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities were 177 million at december 31 2002 compared with 195 million a year earlier the following tables disclose selected information about the gross unrealized losses of torchmark’s fixed maturities at december 31 2002 

  

   

the distribution of expected maturities at december 31 of the indicated year is as follows 

  

   

  

with emphasis on bond investments over investments in equities mortgages or real estate the relative percentage of torchmark’s investments by type continues to vary from industry data the following table presents torchmark’s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december 31 2002 with the latest industry data 

  

    

during 2001 torchmark adopted a new accounting principle recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitized financial assets eitf 9920  which changed the method of accounting for certain of its assetbacked securities as a result of the requirements of the new principle torchmark wrote these investments down 41 million or 27 million net of tax which has been reported as a change in accounting principle subsequent to adoption impairments of these assets have been and will be reported as realized investment losses in 2001 after the adoption of the new rule an additional impairment loss of 16 million after tax was recorded additionally certain of the assetbased securities were sold during both 2002 and 2001 these sales resulted in proceeds of 40 million at an aftertax loss of 170 thousand in 2001 and proceeds of 13 million at an aftertax loss of 3 million in 2002 at yearend 2002 torchmark held less than 300 thousand at fair value of assetbacked securities considered impaired by eitf 9920 for more information on the effects of this accounting rule see note 11—change in accounting principle in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 65 of this report 

  

credit risk sensitivity  credit risk is the level of certainty that a security’s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity in the past two years due to the economic downturn and other factors the securities of many industry sectors especially affected have suffered increased credit risk as a result many securities have been downgraded by creditrating agencies to belowinvestment grade status thus the likelihood the issuers will honor their securities’ terms has been reduced and the securities’ market values have been impaired as torchmark continues to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities credit risk is a concern torchmark mitigates this ongoing risk in part by only acquiring investmentgrade bonds and also by investigating the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer the table below demonstrates the credit rankings of torchmark’s fixed income portfolio 

  

   

  

torchmark reduces credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors the following table presents the highest ten percentage holdings of torchmark’s corporate fixed maturities by industry sector at december 31 2002 

  

   

otherwise no individual industry represented 19 or more of torchmark’s corporate fixed maturities 

  

market risk sensitivity market risk is the risk that the value of a security will change because of a change in market conditions torchmark’s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk which is the risk that a change in a security’s value could occur because of a change in interest rates this risk is significant to torchmark’s investment portfolio because its fixedmaturity holdings amount to 92 of total investments the effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixed investments are reflected on an aftertax basis in torchmark’s shareholders’ equity because these investments are marked to market value under sfas 115 

  

the actual interest rate risk to torchmark is reduced because the effect that changes in rates have on assets is offset by the effect they have on insurance liabilities and on debt interest assumptions are used to compute the majority of torchmark’s insurance liabilities these insurance liabilities net of deferred acquisition costs were 38 billion and debt and preferred securities were 9 billion at december 31 2002 compared with fixedmaturity investments of 69 billion at amortized cost at the same date because of the longterm nature of insurance liabilities temporary changes in value caused by rate fluctuations have little bearing on ultimate obligations in accordance with gaap insurance liabilities and debt are generally not marked to market 

  

market risk is managed in a manner consistent with torchmark’s investment objectives torchmark seeks to maintain a portfolio of highquality fixedmaturity assets that may be sold in response to changing market conditions however it is torchmark’s primary objective to hold securities to maturity torchmark’s strong operating cash flow and stable longterm policy liabilities decrease the likelihood of needing to sell fixed investments for operating liquidity some sales may be made to preserve capital due to changes in credit quality of individual securities or for tax purposes potential volatility in the value of torchmark’s longerterm fixedmaturity holdings is reduced by the company’s practice of holding securities to maturity which has resulted in 33 of the fixed portfolio being expected to repay within five years and 68 within ten years also the portfolio and market conditions are constantly evaluated for appropriate action 

  

no derivative instruments are used to manage torchmark’s exposure to market risk in the investment portfolio interestrate swap instruments have been entered into by torchmark in connection with its preferred stock and certain debt issues as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 70 of this report and in capital resources beginning on page 34 of this report 

  

the liability for torchmark’s insurance policy obligations is computed using interest assumptions some of which are contractually guaranteed a reduction in market interest rates of a permanent nature could cause investment return to fall below guaranteed amounts torchmark’s insurance companies participate in the cash flow testing procedures imposed by statutory insurance regulations the purpose of which is to insure that such liabilities are adequate to meet the company’s obligations under a variety of 

  

interest rate scenarios those procedures indicate that torchmark’s insurance policy liabilities when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such liabilities and the investment income expected to be received on such assets are adequate to meet the obligations and expenses of torchmark’s insurance activities in all but the most extreme circumstances 

  

the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark’s interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark’s fixedmaturity portfolio the data is prepared through a model which incorporates various assumptions and estimates to measure the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options put options and unscheduled repayments could have on the portfolio given the changes in rates the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 

  

   

  

financial condition 

  

liquidity liquidity provides an institution such as torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations torchmark’s liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations portfolio of marketable securities and a line of credit facility 

  

torchmark’s insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs cash flows provided from operations increased in each of the three years ended december 31 2002 over their respective prior year they were 651 million in 2002 compared with 618 million in 2001 and 523 million in 2000 in addition to operating cash flows torchmark received 304 million in investment maturities and repayments during 2002 adding to available cash flows such repayments were 263 million in 2001 and 226 million in 2000 cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are used to build an investment base to fund future requirements available cash flows are also used to repay debt to buy back torchmark shares to pay shareholder dividends and for other corporate uses while torchmark’s cash flows have historically been positive and very strong a reduction in cash flow could negatively affect its liquidity 

  

torchmark’s cash and shortterm investments were 80 million at yearend 2002 and 138 million at yearend 2001 in addition to these highly liquid assets torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale should the need arise these securities had a value of 72 billion at december 31 2002 

  

torchmark has in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and standby letters of credit up to 625 million the facility is split into two parts a 325 million 364day tranche maturing november 27 2003 and a 300 million fiveyear tranche maturing november 30 2006 the company has the ability to request up to 200 million in letters of credit to be issued against the 300 million fiveyear tranche under either tranche interest is charged at variable rates the line of credit is further designated as a backup credit line for a commercial paper program not to exceed 600 million whereby torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial paper at any time commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit on a combined basis may not exceed 625 million at december 31 2002 202 million face amount of commercial paper was outstanding 170 million letters of credit were issued and there were no borrowings under the line of credit a facility fee is charged on the entire 625 million facility the facility does not contain any ratingsbased acceleration triggers which would require early repayment in accordance with the agreements torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization and earnings at december 31 2002 torchmark was in full compliance with these covenants 

  

liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet dividend payments on common and preferred stock interest and principal repayment requirements on parentcompany debt and operating expenses of the parent company dividends from insurance subsidiaries of torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations excluding capital gains and losses on an annual noncumulative basis or 10 of surplus in the absence of special approval distributions are not permitted in excess of statutory net worth subsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements although these restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been and is expected to be more than adequate to meet the cash flow needs for parent company operations during the year 2003 a maximum amount of 283 million is expected to be available to torchmark from insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval 

  

capital resources  in the use of financial measures and ratios to evaluate its use of capital resources torchmark’s management adjusts shareholders’ equity to remove the effect caused by changes in the interest rates in the financial markets torchmark has a large availableforsale fixed maturity portfolio and is required by an accounting rule sfas 115 to revalue the portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period these changes in value net of tax are reflected directly in shareholders’ equity because the size of torchmark’s fixed maturity portfolio is very large relative to shareholders’ equity and because small changes in interest rates can cause huge swings in market value torchmark’s shareholders’ equity as reported in accordance with gaap can be volatile this volatility can distort the measure of torchmark’s capital structure as the shortterm changes in the value of its fixedmaturity investment portfolio have little bearing on its longterm ongoing insurance business for this reason this interestbased market adjustment is removed from shareholders’ equity and related 

  

ratios to provide management and investors a clearer picture of torchmark’s shareholders’ equity a reconciliation of shareholders’ equity excluding sfas 115 with shareholders’ equity is as follows 

  

   

torchmark’s capital structure consists of long and shortterm debt preferred securities and shareholders’ equity torchmark’s debt consists of its funded debt and its commercial paper facility an analysis of torchmark’s funded debt outstanding at yearends 2002 and 2001 at par value is as follows 

  

   

the carrying value of the funded debt was 552 million at december 31 2002 compared with 536 million a year earlier in accordance with accounting rules torchmark carries the 2006 senior notes at fair value since they are backed by derivatives that qualify as a hedge this market value increase accounted for 15 million of the 2002 increase in the carrying value of total funded debt 

  

torchmark issued 180 million principal amount of 6 1  4  senior notes in december 2001 these notes will mature on december 15 2006 and may not be redeemed prior to maturity there is no sinking fund requirement interest is payable semiannually on june 15 and december 15 these notes are unsecured and rank equally with torchmark’s other unsecured indebtedness proceeds from the issuance after underwriters’ discount and expenses of the offering were approximately 178 million proceeds were used initially to pay down shortterm debt 

  

in connection with this issuance torchmark entered into a fiveyear swap agreement with an unaffiliated party to swap the 6 1  4  fixed rate payment obligation for a floating rate obligation the floating rate is based on the sixmonth libor and resets every six months at december 31 2002 the floating rate was 263 the swap arrangement added 36 million net of tax to torchmark’s 2002 net operating income this swap derivative qualifies as a hedge under accounting rules therefore changes in its market value are substantially offset by changes in the value of the debt security torchmark’s derivative instruments are classified as other invested assets 

  

in 2002 torchmark acquired 75 thousand principal amount of its 7 7  8  notes due 2023 at a cost of 76 thousand resulting in a 2 thousand loss on debt redemption after tax in 2001 81 million par value of the 7 7  8  notes was acquired by torchmark at a cost of 83 million resulting in an aftertax loss of 277 thousand in 2000 46 million principal amount of torchmark 7 7  8  notes and 20 million principal amount of the 7 3  8  notes were acquired at a cost of 42 million and 19 million respectively the redemption of this debt in 2000 resulted in an aftertax gain of 202 thousand 

  

in november 2001 torchmark established two capital trusts which in turn sold trust preferred securities in a public offering capital trust i sold 5 million shares and capital trust ii sold 1 million shares the trust preferreds sold in the two offerings have identical terms each offering consisted of 7 3  4  trust preferreds at a liquidation amount of 25 per security resulting in an aggregate liquidation amount of 150 million they are redeemable at torchmark’s option in part or whole at any time on or 

  

after november 2 2006 they are subject to a mandatory redemption on november 1 2041 distributions are cumulative and are paid quarterly at an annual rate of 7 3  4  or at a rate of 19375 per share all payments by the trusts regarding the trust preferreds are guaranteed by torchmark the capital trusts are whollyowned consolidated subsidiaries of torchmark 

  

the two offerings resulted in proceeds to the capital trusts of 145 million after underwriters’ discount and issue expenses the capital trusts used the proceeds to buy 7 3  4  junior subordinated debentures from torchmark in like amount torchmark used these proceeds to redeem the remaining 110 million of outstanding 918 mips and to pay down shortterm debt 

  

in conjunction with the offering of the trust preferred securities torchmark entered into a tenyear swap agreement to replace the 7 3  4  fixeddistribution obligation with a floating rate payment the floating rate is based on the threemonth libor and resets each quarter when the distributions are made the trust preferred swap rate is set in arrears each quarter therefore it is estimated at the end of each accounting period at december 31 2002 the variable rate was 36 this swap derivative does not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair market value at december 31 2002 this swap was valued at a gain of 16 million before tax torchmark’s net operating income was increased 37 million in 2002 as a result of the swap 

  

the mips were originally issued in 1994 at a redemption amount of 200 million with a monthly dividend based on an annual rate of 918 the mips were redeemable at torchmark’s option at any time after september 30 1999 at the full redemption amount of 25 per share torchmark elected to redeem the mips in full during 2001 in three transactions which resulted in an aftertax loss on redemption of 43 million funds to repay 110 million of the principal amount were derived from the issuance of the trust preferred securities in november 2001 while the remaining 90 million balance was redeemed using corporate cash flow or by shortterm borrowings earlier in the year 

  

torchmark has a swap agreement originally entered into when the mips were issued to exchange a monthly fixed payment based on an annual rate of 918 for a floating rate based on the onemonth libor rate on a notional amount of 200 million while the mips have been redeemed the swap is still in place and does not expire until september 30 2004 at december 31 2002 torchmark was obligated to pay at a floating rate of 283 on this agreement while collecting at a rate of 918 torchmark’s net operating income benefited 77 million in 2002 46 million in 2001 and 16 million in 2000 because of this swap agreement at december 31 2002 this swap was carried at its fair market value of 21 million 

  

shortterm debt consists of torchmark’s commercial paper outstanding the commercial paper balance outstanding at december 31 2002 was 201 million at carrying value compared with a balance of 204 million a year earlier the commercial paper borrowing balance fluctuates based on torchmark’s current needs 

  

the following table presents information about torchmark’s debttocapitalization as discussed on page 34  torchmark removes the effect of fluctuations in shareholders’ equity resulting from changes in interest rates caused by accounting rule sfas 115 management believes the debttocapitalization ratio excluding sfas 115 provides a more meaningful presentation of torchmark’s capitalization in addition lending banks require that the capitalization ratios specified in the debt covenants concerning torchmark’s shortterm debt agreements be computed on the basis excluding sfas 115 debttocapitalization is also presented whereby preferred securities are included as either equity or debt 

  

   

torchmark’s ratio of earnings before interest taxes and discontinued operations to interest requirements was 214 times in 2002 compared with 145 times in 2001 and 113 times in 2000 if realized 

  

investment losses were excluded this coverage ratio would have been 236 in 2002 and 146 in 2001 torchmark’s interest expense declined 36 in 2002 to 29 million and 18 to 445 million in 2001 the 2002 decline in interest expense was caused primarily by the lower rates in financial markets that resulted in a benefit from the three interest rate swaps and in reduced interest cost on shortterm debt the 2001 decline also resulted from much lower interest rates in financial markets and a reduction in average debt outstanding 

  

under its share repurchase program torchmark continues to make share purchases in the open market when market conditions are favorable in 2002 torchmark acquired 48 million shares at a cost of 182 million purchases of 78 million shares at a cost of 303 million were made in 2001 and 61 million shares were acquired at a cost of 147 million in 2000 torchmark plans to continue to make share purchases when prices are attractive 

  

in each of the years 2001 and 2000 torchmark executed stock option exercise and restoration programs whereby torchmark employees and directors exercised vested stock options and received a reduced number of new options at the current market price while these programs resulted in the issuance of new shares a substantial portion of the new shares were sold immediately by the participants in the open market to cover the cost of the purchased shares and the related minimum taxes as a result of these restoration programs management’s ownership interest increased and torchmark received a current tax benefit from the exercise of the options the following table presents key information about the programs 

  

   

the following table presents book value per share information on a basis in which the effect of accounting rule sfas 115 has been removed from common shareholder’s equity which is the numerator in this ratio as discussed on page 34 the removal of sfas 115 eliminates the volatility in book value caused by interest rate fluctuations in financial markets that have little bearing on torchmark’s ongoing operations the increases in book value excluding sfas 115 and book value per diluted share excluding sfas 115 in each period resulted primarily from the addition of earnings and were achieved in spite of the torchmark share purchases of 303 million in 2001 and 182 million in 2002

other items 

  

litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined additionally it should be noted that torchmark subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently

new accounting rules 

  

rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections fasb statement no 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after may 15 2002 this statement supersedes previous accounting rules regarding debt extinguishments and certain lease modifications it prohibits reporting gains and losses from debt extinguishments as extraordinary on the income statement unless it is material infrequent and unusual it requires reclassification of such amounts previously classified as extraordinary into continuing operations as a result torchmark’s gains and losses from the purchase of its debt and preferred securities will be included upon adoption as a component of realized gains and losses on the income statement with prior periods reclassified torchmark had pretax losses of 425 thousand on debt redemptions and 66 million from the redemption of its mips in 2001 in 2002 the loss from debt redemptions was 26 thousand pretax the provisions regarding leases are immaterial to torchmark 

  

accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fasb statement no 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 with early application encouraged statement 146 amends previous accounting standards to require the recognition of a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity at the time the liability is incurred previously this liability was recognized at the time of commitment to an exit plan the provisions of this statement should have no material impact on torchmark 

  

  

critical accounting policies 

  

future policy benefits  because of the longterm nature of insurance contracts torchmark’s insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future the liability for future policy benefits represents estimates of the present value of torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries’ expected benefit payments net of the related present value of future net premium collections it is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry using assumptions as to mortality life expectancy morbidity health expectancy persistency and interest rates which are based on torchmark’s previous experience with similar products for the majority of torchmark’s insurance products the assumptions used were those considered to be appropriate at the time the policies were issued an additional provision is made on most products to allow for possible adverse deviation from the assumptions assumed for insurance products considered to be interestsensitive or depositbalance type products the assumptions are monitored on a regular basis and modified when it is determined that actual experience is different from that previously assumed while management and company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents torchmark’s ultimate obligation additionally significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts a complete list of the assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note 7—future policy benefits reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements found on page 62 of this report 

  

deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased  the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset on the balance sheet deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales additionally the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption “value of insurance purchased” deferred acquisition costs are amortized in a systematic manner which matches these costs with the associated revenues the assumptions used to amortize acquisition costs with regard to interest mortality morbidity and persistency are consistent with those used to estimate the liability for future policy benefits for interestsensitive and depositbalance type products these assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and are revised if actual experience differs significantly from original expectations deferred acquisition costs are subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing these tests ensure that the present value of future contractrelated cash flows will support the capitalized deferred acquisition cost asset these cash flows consist primarily of premium income less benefits and expenses taking inflation into account the present value of these cash flows less the benefit reserve is then compared with the unamortized deferred acquisition cost balance in the event the estimated present value of net cash flows is less this deficiency would be charged to expense as a component of amortization and the asset balance is reduced by a like amount different assumptions with regard to deferred acquisition costs could produce materially different amounts of amortization for more information about accounting for deferred acquisition costs see note 1—significant accounting policies and note 5—deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 53 and 61 of this report respectively 

  

policy claims and other benefits payable this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience torchmark management makes an estimate after careful evaluation of all information available to the company however there is no certainty the stated liability for claims and other benefits including the estimate of unsubmitted claims will be torchmark’s ultimate obligation 

  

revenue recognition premium income for torchmark’s subsidiaries’ insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected however in accordance with gaap revenue on limitedpayment contracts and universal lifetype contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently revenues on limitedpayment contracts are recognized over the contract period premium for deposit balance products such as torchmark’s annuity and interestsensitive life policies is added to the policy account value the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance administration surrender and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder in each 

  

case benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 

  

investment income is reported as revenue by torchmark when it is earned less investment expenses the investment activities of torchmark are integral to its insurance operations because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates contract liabilities and other product contract features these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on torchmark’s net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products torchmark benefits to the extent actual net investment income exceeds the required interest on net insurance liabilities and the interest on its debt during 2002 the yield on the investment portfolio exceeded the weightedaverage contractual interest requirement by 187 basis points regardless of the level of investment yield it is torchmark’s responsibility to provide for all future contractual obligations for more information concerning revenue recognition investment accounting and interest sensitivity please refer to note 1—significant accounting policies on page 53 note 3—investments beginning on page 59 in the notes to consolidated financial statements and discussions under the captions annuities on page 26 investments on page 28 and market risk sensitivity on page 32 of this report 

  

impairment of investments  torchmark continually monitors its investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value while the values of the investments in torchmark’s portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions an investment is considered to be impaired only when it has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary “permanent” in accordance with gaap a permanently impaired investment is written down to fair value 

  

the determination that a security is permanently impaired is highly subjective many factors are taken into account including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

these and other factors are analyzed and if a security is considered to be permanently impaired it is written down to the fair value the writedown is recognized as a realized investment loss while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available it is difficult to predict the ultimate recoverable amount of a distressed or impaired security 

  

defined benefit pension plans torchmark maintains funded defined benefit plans covering most fulltime employees it also has unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees torchmark’s obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions in accordance with gaap an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time these obligations are offset by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans torchmark’s pension cost for the defined benefit plans was 23 million 25 million and 26 million in each of the years 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  

the actuarial assumptions used in determining torchmark’s obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover retirement age the expected return on plan assets projected salary increases and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in torchmark’s pension obligation a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation these assumptions are subjective in many cases and small changes 

  

in certain assumptions may cause material differences in reported results while management has used its best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions given the information available from company experience economic data independent consultants and other sources no assurance can be given that actual results will be the same as expected torchmark’s discount rate rate of return on assets and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed in note 12—postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 66 of this report 

  

in order to remove volatility in the changes in the market values of plan investments from year to year gaap permits and torchmark utilizes a “marketrelated value” whereby changes in the market values of investments are recognized systematically over a moving fiveyear period additionally the difference in the pension obligation arising from actual results versus the expected results using actuarial assumptions is generally not recognized in the current period pension cost in future periods is affected by the amount of unrecognized gain or loss in market value and actuarial estimates an unrecognized gain will reduce future cost and an unrecognized loss will increase future costs at december 31 2002 torchmark had an unrecognized actuarial loss of 3 million 

  

torchmark makes cash contributions to the funded plans from time to time subject to mandatory required minimums and internal revenue service allowed maximums for tax deductibility these contributions were 72 million 10 million and 6 million in each of the years 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively assets in the funded plans are placed in a diversified mix of investments at december 31 2002 the composition of investments at fair value was as follows 

  

   

at december 31 2002 torchmark’s qualified pension plans were underfunded by 82 million an analysis of the funded status of torchmark’s pension plans is also disclosed in the abovementioned postretirement benefits note

or surrendered at the election of the insured at any time generally for the
full cash value specified in the policy specific surrender procedures vary
with the type of policy for certain policies this cash value is based upon a
fund less a surrender charge which decreases with the length of time the
policy has been in force this surrender charge is either based upon a
percentage of the fund or a charge per 1000 of face amount of insurance the
schedule of charges may vary by plan of insurance and for some plans by age
of the insured at issue the ratio of aggregate face amount voluntary
terminations to the mean amount of life insurance in force was 178 in 2000

   securities are exempt for valuation reserve purposes and consist of us
   government guaranteed securities

  securities are assigned ratings when acquired all ratings are reviewed and
updated at least annually specific security ratings are updated as
information becomes available during the year

pricing

  premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using
assumptions as to future mortality morbidity persistency and expenses all
of which are generally based on the experience of each insurance subsidiary
and on projected investment earnings revenues for individual life and health
insurance products are primarily derived from premium income and to a lesser
extent through policy charges to the policyholder account values on certain
individual life products profitability is affected to the extent actual
experience deviates from that which has been assumed in premium pricing and to
the extent investment income exceeds that which is required for policy
reserves

  collections for annuity products and certain life products are not
recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values revenues
from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for
insurance risk and administrative costs profits are earned to the extent
these revenues exceed actual costs profits are also earned from investment
income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policy
accounts

underwriting

  the underwriting standards of each torchmark insurance subsidiary are
established by management each company uses information from the application
and in some cases telephone interviews with applicants inspection reports
doctors statements andor medical examinations to determine whether a policy
should be issued in accordance with the application with a different rating
with a rider with reduced coverage or rejected

  for life insurance in excess of certain prescribed amounts each insurance
company requires medical information or examinations of applicants these are
graduated according to the age of the applicant and may vary with the kind of
insurance the maximum amount of insurance issued without additional medical
information is 200000 through age 35 additional medical information is
requested of all applicants regardless of age or amount if information
obtained from the application or other sources indicates that such information
is warranted

  in recent years there has been considerable concern regarding the impact of
the hiv virus associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids
the insurance companies have implemented certain underwriting tests to detect
the presence of the hiv virus and continue to assess the utility of other
appropriate underwriting tests to detect aids in light of medical developments
in this field to date aids claims have not had a material impact on claims
experience

reinsurance

  as is customary among insurance companies torchmark insurance subsidiaries
cede insurance to other unaffiliated insurance companies on policies they
issue in excess of retention limits reinsurance is an effective method for
keeping insurance risk within acceptable limits in the event insurance
business is ceded the torchmark insurance subsidiaries remain contingently
liable with respect to ceded insurance should any reinsurer be unable to meet
the obligations it assumes see note 18commitments and contingencies in the
notes to consolidated financial statements and schedule ivreinsurance
consolidated

reserves

  the life insurance policy reserves reflected in torchmarks financial
statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally
accepted accounting principles these reserves with premiums to be received
in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates
must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature
generally the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations
of reserves are based on company experience similar reserves are held on most
of the health policies written by torchmarks insurance subsidiaries since
these policies generally are issued on a guaranteedrenewable basis a list of
the assumptions used in the calculation of torchmarks reserves are reported

                                  competition

  the insurance industry is highly competitive torchmark competes with other
insurance carriers through policyholder service price product design and
sales efforts in addition to competition with other insurance companies
torchmark faces competition from other financial services organizations while
there are insurance companies competing with torchmark no individual company
dominates any of torchmarks life or health markets

  torchmarks health insurance products compete with in addition to the
products of other health insurance carriers health maintenance organizations
preferred provider organizations and other health care related institutions
which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements

  generally torchmark companies operate at lower administrative expense
levels than their peer companies allowing torchmark to have competitive rates
while maintaining underwriting margins in the case of medicare supplement
business having low expense levels is necessary in order to meet federally
mandated loss ratios and achieve the desired underwriting margins torchmarks
years of experience in the direct response business are a valuable asset in
implementing direct response marketing operations

                                  regulation

  insurance insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in
the states in which they do business the laws of the various states establish
agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include among
other things granting and revoking licenses to transact business regulating
trade practices licensing agents approving policy forms approving certain
premium rates setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements
determining the form and content of required financial statements and
prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted insurance companies
can also be required under the solvency or guaranty laws of most states in
which they do business to pay assessments up to prescribed limits to fund
policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies they are
also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies and
records of their business are subject to examination at any time under the
rules of the naic insurance companies are examined periodically by one or
more of the supervisory agencies the most recent examinations of torchmarks
insurance subsidiaries were american income as of december 31 1995 globe
as of december 31 1997 liberty as of december 31 1996 united american as
of december 31 1996 and uilic as of december 31 1996

  naic ratios the naic developed the insurance regulatory information system
iris which is intended to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring
the financial condition of insurance companies iris identifies twelve
insurance industry ratios from the statutory financial statements of insurance
companies which are based on regulatory accounting principles and are not
based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap iris specifies a
standard or usual value range for each ratio and a companys variation from
this range may be either favorable or unfavorable the following table
presents the iris ratios as determined by the naic for torchmarks five
largest insurance subsidiaries which varied unfavorably from the usual
value range for the years 1999 and 1998



                                                               usual   reported

                         gross change in capital and surplus 50 to 10    60


explanation of ratios

  nonadmitted assets to admitted assetsthis ratio measures the degree to
which a company has acquired assets which cannot be carried on its statutory
balance sheet american incomes ratio of 10 in 1998 was due to a large
amount of agent balances that arose from commissions that are advanced to
agents when a policy is submitted due to the growth of american incomes
business these advances have grown and caused a variance in this particular
ratio agents balances due to american income are recognized as assets in
torchmarks consolidated financial statements a significant amount of these
balances was sold to an unaffiliated financial institution in 1999

  change in capital and surplusthese ratios calculated on both a gross and
net basis are a measure of improvement or deterioration in a companys
financial position during the year the naic considers ratios less than or
equal to minus 10 and greater than or equal to 50 to be unusual globes
ratio of 60 in 1998 was caused by the establishment of american income as a
subsidiary of globe previously american income was a direct subsidiary of
torchmark american incomes ratio of 114 in 1999 was caused by the sale in
that year of its agents balances to an unaffiliated financial institution
these transactions did not affect the consolidated equity of torchmark at
december 31 1998 or december 31 1999 also these transactions did not
affect globes or american incomes ability to conduct business

                                       8

  risk based capital the naic requires a risk based capital formula be
applied to all life and health insurers the risk based capital formula is a
threshold formula rather than a target capital formula it is designed only to
identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to
rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized all of the insurance
subsidiaries of torchmark are adequately capitalized under the risk based
capital formula

  guaranty assessments state solvency or guaranty laws provide for
assessments from insurance companies into a fund which is used in the event
of failure or insolvency of an insurance company to fulfill the obligations
of that company to its policyholders the amount which a company is assessed
for these state funds is determined according to the extent of these
unsatisfied obligations in each state these assessments are recoverable to a
great extent as offsets against state premium taxes

  holding company states have enacted legislation requiring registration and
periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective
jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to
constitute a holding company system torchmark and its subsidiaries have
registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in
alabama delaware missouri new york texas and indiana

  insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various
limitations on investments in subsidiaries and may require prior regulatory
approval for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions in
excess of statutory net gain from operations on an annual noncumulative basis
by the registered insurer to the holding company or its affiliates

                                   personnel

                           item 3 legal proceedings

  torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or
threatened legal proceedings these lawsuits involve tax matters alleged
breaches of contract torts including bad faith and fraud claims based on
alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of torchmarks subsidiaries
employment discrimination and miscellaneous other causes of action many of
these lawsuits involve claims for punitive damages in state courts of alabama
a jurisdiction particularly recognized for its large punitive damage verdicts
a number of such actions involving liberty also name torchmark as a defendant
in 1999 alabama enacted legislation limiting punitive damages in nonphysical
injury cases to the greater of 500000 or three times compensatory damages
since this legislation has not undergone scrutiny by appellate courts
regarding its constitutionality and a jurys discretion regarding the amount
of compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded in any given case
is not precisely defined the effect of this legislation on torchmarks
litigation remains unclear bespeaking caution is the fact that the likelihood
or extent of a punitive damage award in any given case is currently impossible
to predict as of december 31 2000 liberty was a party to approximately 80
active lawsuits including 10 employment related cases and excluding
interpleaders and stayed cases 71 of which were alabama proceedings in which
punitive damages were sought liberty faces trial settings in these cases on
an ongoing basis

  based upon information presently available and in light of legal and other
factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent
liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently
considered by management to be material it should be noted however that
large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages
awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which torchmark has substantial
business particularly in alabama continue to occur creating the potential
for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage
suit

  as previously reported dismukes v torchmark corporation case no cv94
1006pm which was filed on december 30 1994 in the us district court for
the northern district of alabama was the only remaining purported class

globe united american and certain officers of these companies in the united
states district court for the western district of missouri on behalf of all

                             results of operations

  the following is a discussion of torchmarks operations for the three years
ended december 31 2000 in the analysis and comparison of torchmarks
operating results for 1999 and 2000 with 1998 two divestitures that occurred
in 1998 should be taken into account

  a the divestiture of waddell  reed

  b the sale of family service

  divestiture of waddell  reed in march 1998 waddell  reed torchmarks
asset management subsidiary completed an initial public offering of
approximately 24 million shares of its common stock the offering represented
approximately 36 of waddell  reeds shares net proceeds from the offering
were approximately 516 million after underwriters fees and expenses waddell
 reed used 481 million of the proceeds to repay existing notes owed to
torchmark and other torchmark subsidiaries and retained the remaining 35
million torchmarks 481 million proceeds from the note repayments were
invested or used to pay down debt see the discussion on investments on page
29 liquidity on page 33 and capital resources on page 33 of this report
the initial public offering resulted in a 426 million gain which was added to
torchmarks additional paidin capital torchmark retained the remaining 64
of the waddell  reed stock

  on november 6 1998 torchmark distributed its remaining 64 investment in
waddell  reed through a taxfree spinoff to torchmark shareholders each
torchmark shareholder of record on october 23 1998 received a total of 3018
waddell  reed shares per torchmark share after the spinoff torchmark
retained no further ownership interest in waddell  reed as a result of the
transaction torchmark incurred 54 million in expenses related to the spin
off the majority of which was 50 million of corporate federal income tax
resulting from the distribution of a portion of the policyholder surplus
account of a torchmark life subsidiary

  torchmark has accounted for the spinoff of waddell  reed as a disposal of
a segment accordingly torchmarks financial statements for 1998 and all
prior periods were modified to present the net assets and operating results of
waddell  reed as discontinued operations of the disposed segment the 54
million expense of the spinoff is included in discontinued operations under
the caption loss on disposal the distribution of the waddell  reed shares
resulted in a reduction in torchmarks shareholders equity in the approximate
amount of 174 million consisting of the equity in waddell  reed net of the
36 minority interest torchmarks share of waddell  reeds earnings for 1998
was 48 million after reduction for the minority interest during the period
subsequent to the initial public offering but before the spinoff

  sale of family service on june 1 1998 torchmark sold family service a
preneed funeral insurer to an unaffiliated insurance carrier consideration
for the sale was 140 million in cash torchmark recorded a pretax realized
loss on the sale of approximately 14 million but incurred a tax expense on
the transaction of 9 million for a total aftertax loss of 23 million in
connection with the sale torchmark agreed to continue to service the policies
in force of family service for five years from the sale date for a fee of 2
million per year plus certain variable processing costs through may 1998
family service contributed 25 million in revenues and 58 million in pretax
income invested assets were 778 million and total assets were 828 million
at the date of the sale

  summary of operating results torchmarks management computes a
classification of income called net operating income torchmarks management
focuses on net operating income in evaluating the operating performance of the
company it differs from net income as reported in the financial statements in
that it excludes unusual and nonrecurring income or loss items and
nonoperating items which distort operating trends it also excludes
discontinued operations

  the following items were excluded from net income as reported in torchmarks
financial statements in order to compute net operating income

  1  realized investment gains and losses and the related adjustment to
      deferred acquisition costs net of tax

                                      17
page

  2 net income or loss from the discontinued operations of waddell  reed
     including the 54 million nonrecurring expenses of the spinoff

  3 torchmarks pro rata share of the income or losses related to vesta in
     1998

  4 the nonrecurring loss from the redemption by torchmark of its debt in
     1998 in the amount of 5 million net of tax and the gain from redemption
     of debt in 2000 of 2 million net of tax

  5 a onetime gain on the sale of equipment included in other income in
     the aftertax amount of 33 million in 1999 and

  6 the effect of a change in accounting principle which modified the
     accounting for an interest rate swap instrument increasing net income
     in the aftertax amount of 161 million in 1999

  additionally in 1999 torchmark entered into a life insurance marketing
arrangement with a third party discussed more fully under the caption life
insurance on page 21 of this report this agreement contained certain cash
guarantees to the third party which would not be recoverable by torchmark
based on test marketing results accordingly torchmark recorded a
nonrecurring aftertax operating charge of 13 million or 10 per diluted
share in 1999 because this was an unusual onetime charge net operating
income has been presented before the charge for comparability

  a reconciliation of net operating income to net income on a per diluted
share basis is as follows

                        income to reported net income

average premium per policy issued sales in 1999 rose 3 over 1998 sales of
94 million sales growth in 1999 had declined from 1998 due in part to the
withdrawal from the underage 40 adult direct mail market because of
unfavorable financial results from that market direct mail sales to ages 40
to 50 were interrupted for part of the year while those products were repriced
to improve their financial results the annualized life premium issued by the

response operation has promoted growth in some of torchmarks agentbased
distribution channels through marketing support this support includes
providing sales leads and assisting in agent recruiting this assistance has

exclusive agency through its assistance in the agent recruiting process and by
providing leads to the agents

in terms of annualized premium issued grew 4 during 2000 to 54 million
compared with 13 growth in 1999 sales growth in the liberty agency is

an increase of 5 they further increased 4 to 1902 at yearend 1999 and 7
to 2032 at year end 2000 ongoing agent recruitment efforts and training

which were also 37 million in each year

  in the third quarter of 1999 readers digest association and torchmark
entered into an agreement to market torchmark life insurance products to
certain readers digest customers these products were marketed through
torchmarks direct response operation and required torchmark to guarantee
specified compensation to readers digest regardless of marketing success
test marketing began in the fourth quarter of 1999 the less than favorable
results from these tests indicated that it would be unlikely that torchmark
would recover the full amount of compensation guaranteed to readers digest
under the terms of the agreement as a result torchmark recorded a
nonrecurring operating charge of 21 million in the fourth quarter of 1999
this charge represented 13 million after tax or 10 per diluted share
torchmark has maintained its relationship with readers digest and has used
its subscriber lists in selective marketing of torchmark insurance products
and intends to continue to do so however torchmark will only incur its
normal solicitation costs on future business and will have no further costs
related to the guaranteed compensation

  life insurance gross margins have been presented in the above table to
remove the effect of family service underwriting income in 1998 and the 1999
nonrecurring charge which distort comparisons excluding these items gross
margins as indicated by insurance underwriting income before other income and
administrative expense increased 3 in 2000 to 271 million after having
risen 4 in 1999 to 263 million as a percentage of life insurance premium
life insurance gross margins were 26 in both 1999 and 1998 but were 25 in
2000 one factor in the 1 decline in 2000 is the reduction in underwriting
income margins for direct response as a percentage of premium direct
response underwriting income was 263 in 2000 compared with 279 a year
earlier additionally an increase in policy obligation ratios was experienced
in the other category in the first half of 2000 which appears to have been a
shortterm aberration fluctuations in obligation ratios are normal in the
life insurance industry

which the federal medicare program does not pay during the last few years
torchmark has focused on developing its united american exclusive agency to
serve this market use of targeted marketing support and increased agent
recruiting have led to increased sales because of loss ratio regulation
underwriting margins on medicare supplements are less than on torchmarks life
business however due to united americans low cost serviceoriented
customer service and claims administration as well as its economies of scale
it is a profitable line of business

  until recently the primary competition for medicare supplement sales had
come from medicare health maintenance organizations hmos the managed care
alternative to traditional feeforservice medicare which eliminated the need
for a supplemental policy however in the last few years growing public
dissatisfaction with managed care increased medical cost inflation and
increased federal government regulatory pressures on medicare hmos have
caused an increasing number of hmos to withdraw from the market reducing
that competition other regulatory issues continue to affect the medicare
supplement market medical cost inflation and changes to the medicare program
cause the need for annual rate increases which generally require state
insurance department approval in addition congress and the federal
administration have begun studying ways to restructure the medicare program
therefore it is likely that changes will be made to the medicare program at
sometime in the future however it appears that there will continue to be an
important role for private insurers in helping senior citizens cover their
healthcare costs as a result medicare supplements should continue as a
popular product for seniorage consumers

from 11 million in sales in 1999 sales in 1998 were also 10 million a
portion of the growth in cancer annualized premium in force has been

as a percentage of premium underwriting income before other income and
administrative expense remained steady at approximately 18 throughout the
threeyear period ending in 2000 medicare supplement margins are restrained
by the federally mandated minimum loss ratio of 65 and by competition cancer
product obligation ratios have increased in recent years primarily due to
higher loss ratios experienced on a closed block of business management has
actively sought timely and adequate premium rate increases from regulatory
authorities to offset these cost increases as a result margins on cancer
business improved slightly in 2000 torchmark continues to seek such rate
increases to maintain margins on this business

  annuities annuity products are marketed by torchmark to service a variety
of needs including retirement income and longterm taxdeferred growth
opportunities torchmarks annuities are sold almost entirely by the united
investors agency a component of torchmarks other distribution category this
agency consists of the waddell  reed sales force which markets united
investors annuities and other products under a marketing agreement in 2000
this agency collected 622 million of torchmarks total 650 million in
annuity collections or 96 the united investors agency accounted for almost
99 of total annuity policy charges in 2000 annuities are also marketed by
the united american independent agency which collected 24 million in annuity
deposits in 2000 compared with 56 million in 1999

  annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis fixed annuity
deposits are held and invested by torchmark and are obligations of the
company variable annuity deposits are invested at the policyholders
direction into his choice among a variety of mutual funds which vary in
degree of investment risk and return a fixed annuity investment account is
also available as a variable annuity investment option investments pertaining
to variable annuity deposits are reported as separate account assets and the
corresponding deposit balances for variable annuities are reported as
separate account liabilities

  annuity premium is added to the annuity account balance as a deposit and is
not reflected in income revenues on both fixed and variable annuities are
derived from charges to the annuity account balances for insurance risk
administration and surrender depending on the structure of the contract
variable accounts are also charged an investment fee and a sales charge
torchmark benefits to the extent these policy charges exceed actual costs and
to the extent actual investment income exceeds the investment income which is
credited to fixed annuity policyholders

  the following table presents the annuity account balance at each year end
and the annuity collections for each year for both fixed and variable
annuities excluding family service

  collections of fixed annuity premium were 42 million in 2000 compared with
72 million in 1999 a 42 decrease fixed annuity premium collections rose
11 in 1999 from 65 million in 1998 management believes that the interest
rate environment is one factor in the sales of fixed annuities as rates fall
alternative investments including variable annuities become more attractive
in 1999 as interest rates increased fixed annuities became more desirable
relative to alternative investments even though rates continued to rise in
2000 a decline in fixed annuity sales resulted from the loss of a key
independent agent from the united american independent agency this decline is
expected to be temporary as management is in the process of redirecting
annuity sales efforts in this agency the fixed annuity deposit balance
declined 2 in 2000 to 662 million at year end it rose 5 in the prior year
from 647 million at yearend 1998 to 677 million at the end of 1999

  variable annuity collections rose 55 to 608 million in 2000 from 393
million in the prior year variable collections rose 31 from 299 million in
1998 the strength in financial markets throughout most of 2000 and the two
preceding years has had a positive influence on sales of variable annuities in
each period the variable annuity account balance continues to grow this
balance increased 9 in 2000 from 33 billion at december 31 1999 to 36
billion at yearend 2000 this balance had previously increased 40 in 1999
and 29 in 1998 strong financial markets in all of these periods contributed
greatly to the growth although some weakening in markets was experienced in
the latter part of 2000 variable accounts are valued based on the market
values of the underlying securities the additional collections in each year
also added to the balances

and administrative expense has grown steadily throughout each of the years
1998 through 2000 this underwriting income was 31 million in 2000 and 27
million in 1999 each representing a 15 increase over the prior year policy
charges have also grown in each period rising 29 in 2000 and 22 in 1999
growth in policy charges is primarily related to the growth in the size of the
account balance but is also attributable to the increase in the number of
annuity contracts in force and the cumulative effect of the growth in sales
over the past few years upon which the sales charge is based

  excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to
investment operations and cash flow management it is defined as net
investment income on a taxequivalent basis reduced by the interest cost
credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with
capital funding or financing costs excess investment income is increased in
a number of ways an increase in investment yields over the rates credited to
policyholders liabilities or in relationship to the rates applicable to
torchmark debt growth in invested assets in relation to policy liabilities
and debt and the efficient use of capital resources and cash flow

  net investment income increased 6 to 472 million in 2000 in 1999 net
investment income declined 3 to 447 million after rising 7 to 460 million
in 1998 on a taxequivalent basis in which the yield on taxexempt
securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on
taxable securities investment income gained 5 in 2000 after declining 3 in
1999 and rising 7 in 1998 the 2000 increase in investment income resulted
from a combination of the growth in mean invested assets and an increase in
yield mean invested assets computed based on book value rose 4 to 66
billion in 2000 over the prior year as new cash flow was invested primarily
in taxable fixed maturities the mean fixed maturity balance rose 381 million
or 7 to 61 billion for 2000 the 2000 growth in mean invested assets was
achieved even though 147 million was used to buy torchmark stock and 95
million was used to pay down long and shortterm debt higher interest rates
in financial markets caused yields on the fixed maturity portfolio to rise 8
basis points in 2000 to 747 the 1999 decline in investment income was a
result of the sale of family service in the second quarter of 1998 and
repurchases of torchmark stock since late 1998 the family service sale
resulted in the investment of approximately 140 million proceeds producing
an additional 10 million of investment income in 1999 compared with
incremental investment income of 6 million in 1998 however the 1998 tax
equivalent net investment income also included 22 million earned on family
service assets which were not included in 1999 mean invested assets were flat
in 1999 as the growth in 1999 invested assets from reinvested cash flows was
essentially offset by the loss of family services 778 million in invested
assets when compared with the prior year

  excess investment income increased 5 in both 2000 and 1999 because of the
effect of repurchases of torchmark stock excess investment income on a per
share basis increased 10 in both 2000 and 1999 the 5 increase in 2000
correlated closely with the change in taxequivalent investment income for the
same period while the 1998 sale of family service caused a reduction in 1999
investment income when compared with 1998 it had little effect on the excess
investment income comparison in 1999 with 1998 the reduction in required
interest on family services policy liabilities offset the loss in investment
income the 1999 increase in excess investment income resulted primarily from
decreased financing costs due to debt paydowns

  during 1999 torchmark entered into two transactions to dispose of the
majority of its investment real estate total consideration for the combined
transactions was 123 million of which 111 million was cash the real estate
dispositions resulted in an aftertax loss of 41 million after the sales
torchmark retained 16 million in investment real estate of which 8 million
was represented by properties partially occupied by torchmark subsidiaries at
december 31 2000 torchmark held 15 million in investment real estate

  portfolio adjustments resulting in 8 million in aftertax capital losses
were taken in 2000 these losses were partially offset however by a 5
million aftertax gain from the increase in market value of the interestrate
swap associated with torchmarks mips discussed in more depth under the
caption capital resources found on page 34 of this discussion in 1999 in
addition to the real estate capital losses torchmark also generated 19
million in aftertax losses during 1999 from the planned sale of fixed
maturities these losses allowed torchmark to carry back and recover capital
gains taxes paid in prior years realized losses in 1999 also included a 12
million aftertax loss from the interestrate swap on torchmarks mips

  while yields as measured by returns on us treasury securities fell
substantially during 2000 corporate spreads widened and afforded investors
the opportunity to increase nominal and effective returns new investments in
fixedmaturity securities which totaled 11 billion in 2000 21 billion in
1999 and 18 billion in 1998 were made at an effective compounded yield of
807 in 2000 compared with an effective compounded yield of 754 in 1999
and 726 in 1998 these yields equate to nominal yields on acquisition of
787 738 and 713 respectively for 2000 1999 and 1998 the size of
acquisitions in the current year is not comparable with the prior year since
1999 included proceeds from tax motivated bond sales and from the sale of real
estate

  with the flat yield curve available much of the year higher returns were
possible in spite of a shortening of maturities the average life of 2000
acquisitions was 77 years compared with 149 years in 1999 and 207 years in
1998 purchases of fixedmaturity investments with shorter maturities caused
the average life of the portfolio to decline to 118 years at year end 2000
compared with 127 years at yearend 1999 but above the yearend 1998 level of
88 years

  with 2000 acquisitions made at yields in excess of the portfolio average
the nominal portfolio yield increased to 747 compared with 739 during
1999 and 742 in 1998 emphasis continues to be on marketable medium quality
investments approximately 92 of invested assets are fixedmaturity
securities and 94 of these holdings are classified as investment grade by
the rating agencies the naic considers 95 of the portfolio investment grade
the portfolio is highly marketable although its value fluctuates with changes
in interest rates at year end 2000 the unrealized loss of 236 million
compares with an unrealized loss of 275 million at the end of 1999 and an
unrealized gain of 249 million at the end of 1998 distribution of maturities
is as follows

  market risk sensitivity market risk is the risk that the value of a
security will change because of a change in market conditions torchmarks
primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk which is the risk that
a change in a securitys value could occur because of a change in interest
rates this risk is significant to torchmarks investment portfolio because
its fixedmaturity holdings amount to 92 of total investments the effects of
interest rate fluctuations on fixed investments are reflected on an aftertax
basis in torchmarks shareholders equity because these investments are marked
to market

  the actual interest rate risk to torchmark is reduced because the effect
that changes in rates have on assets is offset by the effect they have on
insurance liabilities and on debt interest assumptions are used to compute
the majority of torchmarks insurance liabilities these insurance
liabilities net of deferred acquisition costs were 32 billion and debt was
7 million at december 31 2000 compared with fixedmaturity investments of
62 billion at amortized cost at the same date because of the longterm
nature of insurance liabilities temporary changes in value caused by rate
fluctuations have little bearing on ultimate obligations insurance
liabilities and debt are not marked to market

  market risk is managed in a manner consistent with torchmarks investment
objectives torchmark seeks to maintain a portfolio of highquality fixed
maturity assets that may be sold in response to changing market conditions a
significant change in the level of interest rates changes in credit quality
of individual securities or changes in the relative values of a security or
asset sector are the primary factors that influence such sales occasionally
the need to raise cash for various operating commitments may also necessitate
the sale of a security volatility in the value of torchmarks fixedmaturity
holdings is reduced by maintaining a relatively shortterm portfolio 20 of
which matures within five years and 64 of which matures within ten years
also the portfolio and market conditions are constantly evaluated for
appropriate action

  no derivative instruments are used to manage torchmarks exposure to market
risk in the investment portfolio an interestrate swap instrument was entered
into by torchmark in connection with its mips as discussed in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements on page 65 of this report and in capital
resources on page 34 of this report a cap instrument was also previously
entered into to protect torchmark from the market risk on an increase in rates
associated with the swap on this security this cap expired during 1999

  the liability for torchmarks insurance policy obligations is computed using
interest assumptions some of which are contractually guaranteed a reduction
in market interest rates of a permanent nature could cause investment return
to fall below amounts guaranteed torchmarks insurance companies participate
in the cash flow testing procedures imposed by statutory insurance
regulations the purpose of which is to insure that such liabilities are
adequate to meet the companys obligations under a variety of interest rate
scenarios those procedures indicate that torchmarks insurance policy
liabilities when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such
liabilities and the investment income expected to be received on such assets
are adequate to meet the obligations and expenses of torchmarks insurance
activities in all but the most extreme circumstances

  the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmarks
interestrate sensitive fixedmaturity portfolio at december 31 2000 and
december 31 1999 this table measures the effect of a change in interest
rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of
torchmarks fixedmaturity portfolio the data is prepared through a model
that measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained
change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points it takes into
account the effect that special option features such as call options put
options and unscheduled repayments would have on the portfolio given the
changes in rates the valuation of these option features is dependent upon
assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past
performance

                              financial condition

  liquidity liquidity pertains to an institutions ability to meet on demand
the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial
obligations torchmark has very strong liquidity as evidenced by its three
sources of liquidity its positive cash flow from operations its portfolio of
marketable securities and its line of credit facility

  torchmarks insurance operations generate positive cash flows in excess of
its immediate needs cash flows provided from operations were 533 million in
2000 compared with 512 million in 1999 and 389 million in 1998 in addition
to operating cash flows torchmark received 226 million in investment
maturities and repayments during 2000 adding to available cash flows such
repayments were 413 million in 1999 and 474 million in 1998 cash flows in
excess of immediate requirements are used to build an investment base to fund
future requirements

  torchmarks cash and shortterm investments were 136 million at december
31 2000 compared with 115 million at yearend 1999 in addition to these
highly liquid assets torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity
securities which are available for sale should the need arise these
securities had a value of 60 billion at december 31 2000

  torchmark has a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows
unsecured borrowings up to a specified maximum amount the maximum amount on
this facility was 600 million at december 31 2000 interest is charged at
variable rates for borrowings this line of credit is further designated as a
backup credit line for a commercial paper program not to exceed 600 million
whereby torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial
paper at any time but may not borrow in excess of a total of 600 million on
the combined facilities at december 31 2000 331 million in face amount of
commercial paper was outstanding and there were no borrowings on the line of
credit a fee is charged on the entire 600 million facility in accordance
with the agreements torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding
capitalization and earnings at december 31 2000 torchmark was in full
compliance with these covenants

  liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the
subsidiaries to pay dividends dividends are paid by subsidiaries to the
parent in order to meet its dividend payments on common and preferred stock
interest and principal repayment requirements on parentcompany debt and
operating expenses of the parent company these requirements have declined in
both 2000 and 1999 from the respective prior year dividends from insurance
subsidiaries of torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain
from operations excluding capital gains and losses on an annual
noncumulative basis or 10 of surplus in the absence of special approval
distributions are not permitted in excess of statutory net worth subsidiaries
are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements although these
restrictions exist dividend availability from subsidiaries has been and is
expected to be more than adequate for parent company operations during the
year 2001 a maximum amount of 240 million is expected to be available to
torchmark from insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval

  capital resources torchmarks capital structure consists of long and short
term debt mips and shareholders equity torchmarks debt is primarily its
funded debt and its commercial paper facility an analysis of torchmarks
funded debt outstanding at yearends 2000 and 1999 on the basis of par value
was as follows

  the carrying value of the funded debt was 366 million at december 31 2000
compared with 372 million a year earlier

  during 1998 and 1999 torchmark acquired a portion of its funded debt in the
open market through its insurance subsidiaries in 1999 75 million
principal amount of its 7 78 notes due 2023 was acquired at a cost of 79
million also in 1999 40 million principal amount of its 7 38 notes due
2013 was purchased for 41 million in 1998 torchmark bought 108 million
of its 7 78 notes at a price of 106 million insurance company holdings in
the funded debt reduce consolidated debt outstanding

  in 2000 all of the debt previously acquired by insurance subsidiaries was
acquired from those subsidiaries by the parent company additionally another
46 million principal amount of the 7 78 notes and 20 million principal
amount of the 7 38 notes were acquired by torchmark in 2000 at a cost of
42 million and 19 million respectively the redemption of this debt in
2000 resulted in an aftertax gain of 202 thousand

  during 1998 torchmark received approximately 481 million in intercompany
note repayments from waddell  reed as a result of their initial public
offering torchmark utilized a portion of these funds to pay down funded debt
it also took advantage of the lower interest rate environment in 1998 to
refinance existing funded debt at lower shortterm rates in early 1998
torchmark repaid 20 million principal amount on its 8 58 sinking fund
debentures due in 2017 of which 8 million was a mandatory redemption and 12
million was an optional repayment under the terms of the agreement on april
1 1998 torchmark called the remaining 160 million principal balance of this
debt at the prevailing call price of 10376 or 166 million a loss on the
redemption of debt was recorded in the second quarter of 1998 in the aftertax
amount of 5 million representing the difference between the total call price
and the carrying value of 158 million in addition to the call torchmarks 9
58 senior notes principal amount 200 million matured on may 1 1998
torchmark borrowed on its commercial paper facility to repay the sinking fund
debentures that were called and to repay its senior notes upon maturity with
accrued interest in the combined amount of 377 million

  the mips were issued in november 1994 at a redemption amount of 200
million with an annual dividend rate of 918 they are subject to a mandatory
redemption in full at september 30 2024 although torchmark may elect to
extend the mips for up to an additional 20 years if certain conditions are
met they are currently redeemable at torchmarks option at any time while
torchmark is obligated to pay dividends at a fixed rate of 918 torchmark
has in place a tenyear interestrate swap agreement with an unaffiliated
party the swap agreement calls for torchmark to pay a variable rate on the
200 million face amount in exchange for payment of the fixed dividend by the
other party the swap expires in 2004 torchmark is at risk on this instrument
for higher financing costs to the extent interest rates rise during the
remaining term at december 31 2000 the variable rate was 80 during 2000
torchmarks aftertax dividend cost for the mips was 103 million compared
with 119 million that would have been incurred without the swap torchmarks
aftertax cost in 1999 was 92 million and in 1998 was 98 million saving
27 million and 21 million in each of those years respectively

  effective january 1 1999 torchmark changed its method of accounting for
the swap agreement to recognize changes in its fair value net of tax as
realized investment gains or losses this method of accounting for such
instruments was believed to be preferable under the guidance established by
statement of financial accounting standards no 80 accounting for futures
contracts sfas 80 and the securities and exchange commission previously
torchmark accounted for the swap using hedge accounting under sfas 80 the
aftertax cumulative effect of the change at january 1 1999 was 161 million
net of income taxes of 87 million the effect of the change on the twelve
months ended december 31 1999 was to increase realized losses by 117
million 09 per diluted share excluding the cumulative effect of the
change in accounting principle market value of the swap which is included as
a component of other invested assets was 143 million and 67 million at
december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively

  during july 1999 torchmark filed a form s3 registration statement with
the securities and exchange commission for the shelf registration of capital
securities in an aggregate face amount of 300 million proceeds from the
issuance of any such capital securities could be used for the possible
purchase of torchmark securities for working capital for the repayment of
debt for acquisitions or for any other general corporate purpose or business
opportunity as of december 31 2000 no capital securities have been issued
under this registration statement

  shortterm debt consists of torchmarks commercial paper outstanding the
commercial paper balance outstanding at december 31 2000 was 329 million at
carrying value compared with a balance of 418 million a year earlier the
commercial paper borrowing balance fluctuates based on torchmarks current
cash needs

  total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 215 at december 31
2000 in the computation of this ratio the mips are counted as equity and the
effect of fluctuations in security values based on changes in interest rates
in financial markets are excluded this debttocapitalization ratio was 252
at yearend 1999 and 243 at yearend 1998 the decline in the debtto
capitalization ratio at yearend 2000 was caused primarily by shortterm debt
paydowns the 1999 increase in this ratio resulted from the increase in short
term borrowings torchmarks ratio of earnings before interest taxes and
discontinued operations to interest requirements was 113 in 2000 compared
with 87 in 1999 and 89 in 1998 torchmarks interest expense rose 4 to 54
million in 2000 after having declined 7 to 52 million in 1999 the increase
in 2000 was due primarily to an increase in shortterm borrowing costs which
offset the lower amount of average debt outstanding the 1999 decrease was
caused by a larger portion of total debt being shortterm debt that carries a
lower borrowing cost

  torchmark has made share purchases from time to time under its share
repurchase program on the open market when market conditions were favorable
torchmark purchased 61 million shares on the open market at a cost of 147
million in 2000 and 67 million shares at a cost of 222 million in 1999
purchases of 34 million shares were made in 1998 at a cost of 126 million
subsequent to the waddell  reed spin off torchmark will continue to make
share purchases under its share repurchase program when prices are attractive
share purchases could have a favorable impact on earnings per share and return
on equity

  on november 15 1999 torchmark executed a stock option exercise and
restoration program through which 80 torchmark directors and employees
exercised vested stock options and received a reduced number of replacement
options at the current market price this program resulted in the issuance of
18 million shares but over 13 million of the new shares were immediately
sold by the directors and employees through the open market to cover the cost
of the purchased shares and the related taxes a similar option exercise and
restoration program was conducted on december 20 2000 for two executives not
able to participate in the 1999 program under the 2000 program 433 thousand
shares were issued but 283 thousand shares were sold to pay the exercise price
and taxes as a result of both of these restoration programs managements
ownership interest increased and torchmark received a significant current tax
benefit from the exercise of the options

  shareholders equity rose 10 to 220 billion at december 31 2000
shareholders equity declined 12 in 1999 from 226 billion at yearend 1998
to 199 billion at yearend 1999 the 2000 increase of 209 million in
shareholders equity resulted primarily from the addition of earnings less
the payment of dividends and 147 million of share purchases during the year
the 1999 decrease was impacted by the decrease in the value of the fixed
maturity portfolio due to increases in interest rates in the financial
markets book value per share was 1743 at 2000 year end compared with
1510 at yearend 1999 after adjusting for the impact on shareholders
equity for security value fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in
financial markets shareholders equity rose from 215 billion at yearend
1999 to 234 billion at yearend 2000 book value per share was 1853 at
yearend 2000 an increase of 14 over 1632 at yearend 1999 return on
common shareholders equity was 163 in 2000 compared with 162 in 1999
the returnonequity ratios exclude the mark up or down of shareholders
equity for changes in security values caused by fluctuations in market
interest rates they are also computed on a basis of net operating income
before nonrecurring charge as defined on page 17 through 18 of this report

2000 torchmark held a passive investment in vesta a property insurance
carrier torchmark held 51 million shares of vesta stock or approximately
28 of the outstanding shares of vesta until december 1998 torchmark
carried its investment in vesta during this period on the equity method of
accounting in june 1998 vesta announced that a an investigation of
accounting irregularities that occurred during the fourth quarter of 1997 and
the first quarter of 1998 would result in an aggregate 14 million net after
tax reduction in previously reported net income and in addition that b it
would restate its historical financial statements for the period of 1993
through the first quarter of 1998 reflecting reductions in reported net
aftertax earnings of 49 million for the period of 1993 through 1997 and 10
million for the first quarter of 1998 to reflect its pro rata share of
vestas cumulative reported financial corrections torchmark recorded a pre
tax charge of 20 million 13 million after tax or 09 per diluted share in
the second quarter of 1998 as a result of the announcements relating to vesta
and the decline in value of vesta stock vesta is currently subject to
numerous class action lawsuits in state and federal courts filed subsequent to
such announcements

  in the fourth quarter of 1998 torchmark announced its intention to dispose
of its holdings in vesta and to sell vesta shares under satisfactory terms in
december 1998 torchmark sold 680 thousand vesta shares at a price of 475
per share recording a loss of 3 million after tax in 1999 vesta filed a
registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the
public offering of its shares held by torchmark to facilitate the
registration of vesta shares torchmark reacquired the previously sold 680
thousand shares at a price of 5 per share on november 5 1999 the
registration statement was filed by vesta to offer all of torchmarks holdings
in vesta

  because of its intention to dispose of vesta torchmark wrote its carrying
value of vesta down to net realizable amount effective september 30 1998 the
adjustment produced an aftertax realized loss of 24 million or 17 per
diluted torchmark share net realizable value was 32 million at december 31
1998 during 1998 torchmark recorded a pretax loss of 27 million 18
million after tax or 13 per diluted share on vesta operations including
its pro rata share of vestas cumulative accounting corrections

seats on the vesta board of directors resigned from those vesta seats due to
the vacating of the vesta board seats and the absence of significant influence
regarding vesta torchmark discontinued the equity method of accounting for
vesta and has included vesta in equity securities at market value subsequent
to december 31 1998 torchmark carried vesta at a value of 20 million at
december 31 1999

  torchmark sold 375 million shares of vesta during the second quarter of

  litigation torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties
to pending or threatened litigation most of which involves punitive damage
claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama such
punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive
damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results
bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the extent of
punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case
since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages
including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding
compensatory damages is not precisely defined it is thus difficult to predict
with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given
case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation based
upon information presently available and in light of legal and other factual
defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries contingent liabilities
arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by
management to be material

                             new accounting rules

  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb statement
no 133 as amended by fasb statements no 137 and 138 is effective for all
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000 with
earlier application of all of the provisions of this statement encouraged for
torchmark the statement is effective as of january 1 2001 early adoption of
selective provisions is prohibited prior periods may not be restated for
comparability

  this statement establishes standards for the accounting and reporting of
derivative instruments it requires that all derivatives be recognized as
assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and be measured at fair value
changes in the values of derivatives for the reporting period are reflected as
adjustments to earnings through realized gains and losses if certain
conditions are met a derivative may be designated as a hedge against exposure
to market risks of other instruments or commitments cash flow risks or
foreign currency risks if a derivative is classified as a hedge the
adjustment to earnings is offset by a corresponding change in the value of the
item hedged hedging relationships may be designated anew upon adoption of
this statement

  management believes that statement 133 will have an immaterial impact on
torchmarks financial statements other than the interest rate swap on its
mips which is a freestanding derivative currently carried at fair market
value torchmarks use of derivatives is limited

  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities fasb statement no 140 provides accounting
and reporting standards for transfer and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities it replaces fasb statement no 125 accounting
for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of
liabilities while it revises certain of the provisions of that statement it
carries over most of statement no 125s provisions without reconsideration
statement no 140 also requires certain disclosures

  statement no 140 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial
assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march 31 2001 it
is to be applied prospectively with certain exceptions other than those
exceptions earlier or retroactive application is not permitted the adoption
of statement no 140 should have an immaterial impact on torchmark
