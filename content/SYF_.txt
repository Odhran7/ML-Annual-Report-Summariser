retail card program agreements 

our retail card programs are governed by program agreements that are each negotiated separately with our partners although the terms of the agreements are partnerspecific and may be amended from time to time under a typical program agreement our partner agrees to support and promote the program to its customers but we control credit criteria and issue credit cards to customers who qualify under those criteria we own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination other key provisions in the retail card program agreements include 

term

exclusivity 

the program agreements typically are exclusive for the products we offer and limit our partners’ ability to originate or promote other private label or cobranded credit cards during the term of the agreement 

retailer share arrangements 

most of our retail card program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractuallydefined threshold economic performance for the purposes of these arrangements is typically measured based on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses we may also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements for example on our cobranded credit cards all of these arrangements align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products 

other economic terms 

in addition to the retailer share arrangements the program agreements typically provide that the parties will develop a marketing plan to support the program and they set the terms by which a joint marketing budget is funded the basic terms of the rewards program linked to the use of our product such as opportunities to receive double rewards points for purchases made on a retail card product and the allocation of costs related to the rewards program

buying groups and industry associations 

the programs we have established with buying groups and industry associations such as the home furnishings association jewelers of america and nationwide marketing group are governed by program agreements under which we make our credit products available to their respective members or dealers but these agreements generally do not require the members or dealers to offer our products to their customers under the terms of the program agreements buying groups and industry associations generally agree to support and promote the respective programs these arrangements may include signup fees and volumebased incentives paid by us to the groups and their members 

individuallybranded programs 

our individuallybranded programs are focused on specific industries where we create either companybranded or company and partnerbranded private label credit cards that are usable across all participating locations within the industryspecific network for example our synchrony car care program comprised of merchants selling automotive parts repair services and tires covers over 30000  locations across the united states and cards issued may be dual branded with synchrony car care and partners such as midas michelin tires or pep boys under the terms of these programs we establish merchant discounts applicable to each financing offer and in some cases the fees we charge partners for their membership in the network in addition the synchrony car care program allows for expanded use outside of the program network at certain related merchants such as gas stations similarly we launched the synchrony home credit card network accepted by retailers at more than 10000  locations in industries such as home furnishing flooring and electronics 

dealer agreements 

for the programs we have established with manufacturers buying groups industry associations and individuallybranded programs described above we enter into individual agreements with the merchants and dealers that offer our credit products under these programs these agreements generally are not exclusive and some parties who offer our financing products also offer financing from our competitors our agreements generally continue until terminated by either party with termination typically available to either party at will upon 15 days’ written notice our dealer agreements set forth the economic terms associated with the program including the fees charged to dealers to offer promotional financing and in some cases allow us to periodically change the fees we charge

we enter into provider agreements with individual healthcare providers who become part of our carecredit network these provider agreements are similar to the dealer agreements that govern our relationships with the merchants and dealers offering our payment solutions products in that the agreements are not exclusive and typically may be terminated at will upon 15 days’ notice multiyear agreements are in place for larger multilocation relationships across all markets there are typically no retailer share arrangements with partners in carecredit 

at december 31 2017  we had relationships with over 110  professional and other associations including the american dental association and the american animal hospital association manufacturers and buying groups which endorse and promote our credit products to their members of these relationships over 65  were paid endorsements linked to member enrollment in and volume under the relevant program

our customers

we work directly with our partners using their distribution network communication channels and customer interactions to market our products to their customers and potential customers we believe our presence at our partners’ points of sale instore online and mobile and our ability to make credit decisions instantly for a customer that is already predisposed to make a purchase enables us to acquire new customer accounts at a lower cost than general purpose card issuers 

to acquire new customers we collaborate with our partners and leverage our marketing expertise to create marketing programs that promote our products to creditworthy customers frequently our partners market the availability of credit as part of and with little incremental cost to the advertising for their goods and services our marketing programs include marketing offers eg 10 off the customer’s first purchase and consumer communications that are delivered through a variety of channels including instore signage online advertising retailer website placement associate communication emails text messages direct mail campaigns advertising circulars and outside marketing via television radio print along with digital marketing search engine optimization and paid search we also employ our proprietary quickscreen acquisition method to make targeted preapproved credit offers at the pointofsale our quickscreen technology allows us to run customer information that we have obtained from our partners through our risk models in advance so that when these customers seek to make payment for goods and services at our partners pointsofsale we can make a credit offer instantly if appropriate based on our experience due to the personalized and immediate nature of the offer quickscreen significantly outperforms traditional directtoconsumer preapproved channels such as direct mail or email in response rate and dollar spending 

acquiring and marketing to carecredit customers 

we market our products through our provider network by training our network providers on the advantages of carecredit products and by making marketing materials available for providers to use to promote the program and educate customers our training helps our providers learn to discuss payment options during the pretreatment consultation phase including the option to apply for a carecredit credit card and the offer of promotional credit according to a 2017 survey of our carecredit customers 51  indicated that they would have postponed or reduced the scope of treatment if financing was not offered by their provider consumers can apply for our carecredit products in the provider’s office or online via the web or mobile device 

we also market our products to potential and existing customers directly through our webbased provider locator which allows customers to search for healthcare service providers that accept the carecredit credit card by desired geography and provider type according to our records our carecredit provider locator averaged over 975000  searches per month during the year ended december 31 2017  we believe our partners recognize the locator as an important source of new customer acquisition 

enterprise customer engagement ece  analytics 

after a customer obtains one of our products our marketing programs encourage ongoing card usage by communicating the benefits of our products’ value propositions examples of such programs include promotional financing offers cardholder events product discounts dollaroff certificates account holder sales reward points and offers new product announcements and previews and free or reduced cost gift wrapping alteration or delivery services these programs are executed through our partners’ and our own direct to consumer distribution channels 

through our ece and data analytics teams we optimize these programs through detailed testandlearn tracking of cardholder responsiveness and subsequent behavior this data is leveraged by applying machine learning and other analytic techniques to create tools that allow for customized marketing messages and promotional offers to cardholders for example if a cardholder consistently responds to a coupon sent by text message versus other channels we will tailor future marketing messages to be delivered by text message and use such insight to identify other populations that are likely to behave in similar ways our dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card programs are further enhanced by the collection and analysis of data on customers spend patterns at both our partners and at other retailers the objective of these efforts is to drive incremental volume for our programs while maximizing return on investment 

our extensive marketing activities targeted to existing customers have yielded high levels of reuse across both our payment solutions and carecredit sales platforms during the year ended december 31 2017  27  and 53  of purchase volume across our payment solutions platform and carecredit network respectively resulted from repeat use at one or more retailers or providers

credit under a private label credit card typically is extended either on standard terms only in our retail card sales platform which means accounts are assessed periodic interest charges using an agreed nonpromotional fixed andor variable interest rate or pursuant to a promotional financing offer in our payment solutions and carecredit sales platforms involving deferred interest no interest or reduced interest during a set promotional period promotional periods typically range between six and 48 months but we may agree to longer terms with the partner in almost all cases we receive a merchant discount from our partners to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing the terms of these promotions vary by partner but generally the longer the deferred interest reduced interest or interestfree period the greater the partner’s merchant discount some offers permit customers to pay for a purchase in equal monthly payments with no interest or at a reduced interest rate rather than deferring or delaying interest charges for our deferred interest products approximately 75  to 80  of customer transactions are typically paid off before interest is assessed in carecredit standard rate financing generally applies to charges under 200 

we typically do not charge interchange or other fees to our partners when a customer uses a private label credit card to purchase our partners’ goods and services through our payment system 

most of our private label credit card business is in the united states for some of our partners who have locations in canada we also support the issuance and acceptance of private label credit cards at their locations in canada and from customers in canada 

dual cards   and general purpose cobrand cards 

our patented dual cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to make purchases of goods or services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used to make purchases from other retailers wherever cards from those card networks are accepted or for cash advance transactions we currently issue dual cards for use on the mastercard and visa networks and we currently have the ability to issue dual cards for use on the american express and discover networks 

we have been granted two us patents relating to the process by which our dual cards function as a private label credit card when used to make purchases from our partners and function as a general purpose credit card when used on the systems of other credit card associations 

we also offer general purpose cobranded credit cards that do not function as private label credit cards 

credit extended under our dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards are primarily offered through our retail card platform at december 31 2017  we offered dual card or general purpose cobranded credit cards through 21  of our 29  ongoing retail card programs of which the majority are dual cards we expect to continue to increase the number of partner programs that offer dual cards or general purpose cobranded credit cards and seek to increase the portion of our loan receivables attributable to these products 

charges using a dual card or general purpose cobranded credit card generate interchange income for us in connection with purchases made by cardholders other than instore or online from that partner 

we currently do not issue dual cards or general purpose cobranded credit cards in canada

customer account acquisition 

we have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and have developed varying credit decision guidelines for the different partners we originate credit accounts through several different channels including instore mail internet mobile telephone and preapproved solicitations in addition we have and may in the future acquire accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners 

regardless of the channel in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit we follow a series of credit risk and underwriting procedures in most cases when applications are made instore or by internet or mobile the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately we generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus the credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to calculate a credit score the risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio and product type we periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance and adjust the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage risk different scoring models may be used depending upon bureau type and account source 

we also apply additional application screens based on various inputs including credit bureau information to help identify potential fraud and prior bankruptcies before qualifying the application for approval we compare applicants’ names against the specially designated nationals list maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury “ofac” as well as screens that account for adherence to usa patriot act of 2001 the “patriot act” and credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 the “card act” requirements including ability to pay requirements 

we also use preapproved account solicitations for certain programs potential applicants are prescreened using information provided by our partner or obtained from outside lists and qualified individuals receive a preapproved credit offer by mail or email 

acquired portfolio evaluation 

our risk management team evaluates each portfolio that we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our credit risk guidelines as part of this review we receive data on the thirdparty accounts and loans which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information in addition we benchmark potential portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks finally our risk management team must approve the acquisition taking into account the results of our risk assessment process once assets are migrated to our systems our account management protocols will apply immediately as described below under “ —customer account management ” “ —credit authorizations of individual transactions ” and “ —collections ” 

customer account management 

we regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts this ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customer’s performance with respect to its account with us as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer’s broader credit performance to monitor and control the quality of our loan portfolio including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active account on its monthly cycle date proprietary risk models together with the fico scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly are an integral part of our credit decisionmaking process depending on the duration of the customer’s account risk profile and other performance metrics the account may be subject to a range of account actions including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits 

credit authorizations of individual transactions 

once an account has been opened when a credit card is used to make a purchase instore at one of our partners’ locations or online pointofsale terminals or online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system which allows for realtime updating of accounts each potential sales transaction is passed through a transaction authorization system which takes into account a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved or declined and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted 

fraud investigation 

we provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings new account fraud and transactional fraud we have developed a proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customer’s established pattern our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers we also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud such as utilizing embedded security chips emv for our active dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card products with all of our retail partners 

collections 

all monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts collections personnel generally initiate contact with customers within 30 days after any portion of their balance becomes past due the nature and the timing of the initial contact typically a personal call email text message or letter are determined by a review of the customer’s prior account activity and payment habits 

we reevaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques including internal collection activities use of external vendors and the sale of debt to thirdparty buyers as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent we limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the transaction authorization processes the imposition of credit limits and criteriabased account suspension and revocation processes in certain situations we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules decrease interest rates andor waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us 

customer service 

 

customer service is an important feature of our relationship with our partners our customers can contact us via phone mail email eservice and echat during the year ended december 31 2017  we handled approximately 285 million  calls

technology and data security 

 

products and services 

we leverage information technology and deliver products and services that meet the needs of our partners and enable us to operate our business efficiently the integration of our technology with our partners is at the core of our value proposition enabling among other things customers to “apply and buy” at the point of sale and many of our partners to settle transactions directly with us without an interchange fee a key part of our strategic focus is the continued development of innovative efficient flexible technology and operational platforms to support marketing risk management account acquisition and account management customer service and new product development we believe that the continued investment in and development of these platforms is an important part of our efforts to increase our competitive capabilities reduce costs improve quality and provide faster more flexible technology services therefore we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems processes and competencies to meet our business needs 

as part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technologies we may either develop these capabilities internally or in partnership with thirdparty providers we rely on thirdparty providers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and in some cases architecture designed by us these relationships include first data for our credit card transaction processing and production and fiserv for retail banking 

data security 

the protection and security of financial and personal information of our consumers is one of our highest priorities we have implemented a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards and provides an appropriate level of protection to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our companys and our customers information this includes protecting against any known or evolving threats to the security or integrity of customer records and information and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information 

our information security program is intelligenceled focused on continuously adapting to an evolving landscape of emerging threats and available technology through data gathering and evaluation of emerging threats from internal and external incidents and technology investment security controls are adjusted on a continuous basis we work directly with our partners on an ongoing basis to expand our intelligence ecosystem and facilitate awareness and communications of events outside of the company 

we have developed a security strategy and implemented multiple layers of controls embedded throughout our technology environment that establish multiple control points between threats and our assets our security program is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store process or have access to sensitive data and we require the same level of protection from such thirdparty service providers we evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls through ongoing assessment and measurement 

in addition we identify risks that may threaten customer information and perform a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms systems and applications used to provide our products and services we employ backup and disaster recovery procedures for all the systems that are used for storing processing and transferring customer information and we periodically test and validate our disaster recovery plans we are compliant with the payment card industry pci program 

competition 

 

our industry is highly competitive and is becoming more competitive we compete for relationships with partners in connection with retaining existing or establishing new consumer credit programs our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as alliance data systems american express capital one jpmorgan chase citibank td bank and wells fargo and to a lesser extent potential partners’ own inhouse financing capabilities we compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors including program financial and other terms underwriting standards marketing expertise service levels product and service offerings including incentive and loyalty programs technological capabilities and integration brand and reputation in addition some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting eg new account approval customer service and collections and other core banking responsibilities that we retain 

we also compete for customer usage of our credit products consumer credit provided and credit card payments made using our cards constitute only a small percentage of overall consumer credit provided and credit card payments in the united states consumers have numerous financing and payment options available to them as a form of payment our products compete with cash checks debit cards visa and mastercard credit cards as well as american express discover card other privatelabel card brands and to a certain extent prepaid cards we also compete with nontraditional providers such as financial technology companies in the future we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies such as apple pay chase pay samsung pay and square to the extent that our products are not accepted in or compatible with such technologies we may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry we compete for customers and their usage of our deposit products and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances based on a number of factors including pricing interest rates and fees product offerings credit limits incentives including loyalty programs and customer service some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services including home and automobile loans debit cards and bank branch atm access which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs in addition some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are may have substantially greater resources than we do or may offer a broader range of products and services than we do moreover some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage 

in our retail deposits business we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other directbanking competitors we compete for deposits with traditional banks and in seeking to grow our directbanking business we compete with other banks that have directbanking models similar to ours such as ally financial american express capital one 360 ing discover goldman sachs nationwide sallie mae and united services automobile association “usaa competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to quickly and easily deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors 

intellectual property 

 

we use a variety of methods such as trademarks patents copyrights and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property including our brand synchrony we also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures our brands are important assets and we take steps to protect the value of these assets and our reputation

we operate in accordance with a risk appetite statement setting forth objectives plans and limits and expressing preferences with respect to risktaking activities in the context of overall business goals the risk appetite statement is approved annually by the ermc and the board of directors with delegated authority to the cro for implementation throughout the company the risk appetite statement serves as a tool to preclude activities that are inconsistent with the business and risk strategy the risk appetite statement will be reviewed and approved at least annually as part of the business planning process and will be modified as necessary to include updated risk tolerances by risk category enabling us to meet prescribed goals while continuing to operate within established risk boundaries 

regulation 

 

general 

our business including our relationships with our customers is subject to regulation supervision and examination under us federal state and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices treatment of our customers safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure liquidity dividends and other capital distributions transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel 

as a savings and loan holding company and financial holding company synchrony is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as a large provider of consumer financial services we are also subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb 

the bank is a federally chartered savings association as such the bank is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ which is its primary regulator and by the cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the united states as discussed further throughout this section certain aspects of the doddfrank act are subject to rules that are taking effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us or across the industry see also “ item 1a  risk factors—risks relating to regulation—the doddfrank act has had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations ” 

savings and loan holding company regulation 

overview 

as a savings and loan holding company we are required to register and file periodic reports with and are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board the federal reserve board has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as liquidity risk management securitizations operational risk management internal controls and audit systems business continuity and compensation and other employee benefits we are regularly reviewed and examined by the federal reserve board which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require our response and attention 

the federal reserve board has broad enforcement authority over us and our subsidiaries other than the bank and the its subsidiaries under the doddfrank act we are required to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution that we control such as the bank 

capital 

as a standalone savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to capital requirements 

the following are the minimum capital ratios to which synchrony is subject 

 for a discussion of our capital ratios see “ item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—capital ” 

we are also required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the federal reserve board’s stress test regulations we are required to utilize stresstesting methodologies providing for results under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress although as a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company we currently are not subject to the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” rule the federal reserve board may in the future require us to comply with the ccar process or some modified version of the ccar process under this process the federal reserve board would measure our regulatory capital levels under various stress scenarios further while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the federal reserve board’s capital planning rule we prepare and submit a form of capital plan to the federal reserve board for its review 

liquidity 

as a savings and loan holding company with total consolidated assets in excess of 50 billion we are required to comply with the modified liquidity coverage ratio rule “modified lcr rule” approved by the federal reserve board in 2014 the modified lcr rule requires us to calculate on a monthly basis the ratio of the amount of our high quality liquid assets to our expected total net cash outflows over a 30day stress period “modified lcr ratio” and to maintain a modified lcr ratio above 10 under a rule adopted by the federal reserve board in december 2016 we will be required to disclose our modified lcr ratio and other associated liquidity data on a quarterly basis commencing with the fourth quarter of 2018 

in addition to the modified lcr rule we may in the future be required to comply with rules adopted by the federal reserve board to implement the basel iii net stable funding ratio “nsfr” in the united states which would require us to maintain a minimum acceptable amount of stable funding based on our liquidity characteristics over a oneyear period in june 2016 the federal reserve board proposed a rule to implement the nsfr in the united states under the proposed rule we would be subject to a modified nsfr which would be calibrated at 70 percent of the amount of stable funding that would be required of depository institution holding companies with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or 10 billion or more in total onbalance sheet foreign exposure 

finally the federal reserve board requires bank holding companies of a similar size to us to comply with certain enhanced prudential standards with respect to liquidity management among other things such bank holding companies must maintain diversified liquidity buffers and must regularly conduct liquidity stress tests while as a savings and loan holding company we are not subject to the same enhanced prudential standards that apply to comparable size bank holding companies we currently comply with many aspects of the liquidity management requirements in those enhanced prudential standards including the diversified buffer and stress testing requirements 

dividends and stock repurchases 

we are limited in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock by the federal reserve board including on the basis that doing so would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice where we intend to declare or pay a dividend we generally will be required to inform and consult with the federal reserve board in advance to ensure that such dividend does not raise supervisory concerns it is the policy of the federal reserve board that a savings and loan holding company like us should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition 

according to guidance from the federal reserve board our dividend policies will be assessed against among other things our ability to achieve applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements if we do not achieve applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements we may not be able to pay dividends although we currently expect to meet applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements inclusive of the capital conservation buffer when it is fully phased in by the federal reserve board we cannot be sure that we will meet those requirements or that even if we do if we will be able to pay dividends 

in evaluating the appropriateness of a proposed redemption or repurchase of stock the federal reserve board will consider among other things the potential loss that we may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets as a result of continued asset deterioration and our ability to raise additional common equity and other capital to replace the stock that will be redeemed or repurchased the federal reserve board also will consider the potential negative effects on our capital structure of replacing common stock with any lowertier form of regulatory capital issued moreover the approval process for any capital plan we are required to submit could result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us ” and “ —we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness ” 

activities 

in general savings and loan holding companies may only conduct or acquire control of companies engaged in financial activities as permitted under the relevant provisions of the bank holding company act and the home owners loan act hola savings and loan holding companies that have elected financial holding company status generally can engage in a broader range of financial activities than are otherwise permissible for savings and loan holding companies including securities underwriting dealing and making markets in securities and making merchant banking investments in nonfinancial companies synchrony made an election for financial holding company status in june 2017 

the federal reserve has the authority to limit a financial holding company’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the financial   holding company or any of its depositary institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements   including requirements that the financial holding company and each of its us depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as “wellcapitalized” and “wellmanaged” the federal reserve may also impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may for example require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions if the deficiencies persist federal regulations additionally provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain at least a “satisfactory” rating under the community reinvestment act “cra” the financial holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in additional activities that are permissible only for financial holding companies  

in addition we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit in certain respects the types of acquisitions and investments that we can make for example certain acquisitions of and investments in depository institutions or their holding companies that we may undertake are subject to the prior review and approval of our banking regulators including the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic our banking regulators have broad discretion on whether to approve such acquisitions and investments in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition or investment federal bank regulators may consider among other factors i the effect of the acquisition or investment on competition ii our financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels iii the competence experience and integrity of our management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations iv the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including our record of compliance under the cra v our effectiveness in combating money laundering and vi any risks that the proposed acquisition poses to the us banking or financial system 

certain acquisitions of our voting stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal law investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not directly or indirectly acquire shares of our stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval under the change in bank control act and the hola which prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us without in most cases the prior written approval of the federal reserve board

as an insured depository institution the bank is also subject to the federal deposit insurance act the “fdia” which requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements the fdia sets forth the following five capital tiers “wellcapitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation to be wellcapitalized for purposes of the fdia the bank must maintain a common equity tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets ratio of 65 a tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets ratio of 8 a total capital to riskweighted assets ratio of 10 and a leverage ratio of tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 5 and not be subject to any written agreement order or capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued by the occ to meet or maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure at december 31 2017  the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized for purposes of the fdia 

in addition the bank is required to comply with prudential regulation in connection with liquidity in particular under occ guidelines establishing heightened standards for governance and risk management the heightened standards the bank is required to establish liquidity stress testing and planning processes which the bank has done for a discussion of the heightened standards see “ —heightened standards for risk management governance ” below 

dividends and stock repurchases 

occ regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital including payment of dividends stock redemptions and repurchases cashout mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account the bank must obtain the occ’s approval or give the occ prior notice before making a capital distribution in certain circumstances including if the bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements or will not do so as a result of the proposed capital distribution or certain net income requirements in addition the bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared dividend or other distribution with the federal reserve board the occ or the federal reserve board may object to a capital distribution if among other things i the bank is or as a result of such distribution would be undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized ii the regulators have safety and soundness concerns or iii the distribution violates a prohibition in a statute regulation agreement between us and the occ or the federal reserve board or a condition imposed on us in an application or notice approved by the occ or the federal reserve board additional restrictions on dividends apply if the bank fails the qtl test described below under “ —activities ” 

the fdia also prohibits any insured depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized” if a depository institution is less than adequately capitalized it must prepare and submit a capital restoration plan to its primary federal regulator for approval for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable among other things the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized” a “significantly undercapitalized” depository institution may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized” elect a new board of directors reduce total assets or cease taking deposits from correspondent banks a “critically undercapitalized” institution may be subject to the appointment of a conservator or receiver which could sell or liquidate the institution be required to refrain from making payments on its subordinated debt or be subject to additional restrictions on its activities 

activities 

under hola the occ requires the bank to comply with the qualified thrift lender or “qtl” test under the qtl test the bank is required to maintain at least 6500  of its “portfolio assets” total assets less i specified liquid assets up to 2000  of total assets ii intangibles including goodwill and iii the value of property used to conduct business in certain “qualified thrift investments” primarily residential mortgages and related investments including certain mortgagebacked securities credit card loans student loans and small business loans in at least nine months of the most recent 12month period the bank currently meets that test a savings association that fails to meet the qtl test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter 

savings associations including the bank are subject as well to limitations on their lending and investments these limitations include percentage of asset limitations on various types of loans the bank may make in addition there are similar limitations on the types and amounts of investments the bank may make 

insured depository institutions including the bank are subject to restrictions under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act as implemented by federal reserve board regulation w which govern transactions between an insured depository institution and an affiliate including an entity that is the institution’s direct or indirect holding company and a nonbank subsidiary of such a holding company restrictions in sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act apply to “covered transactions” such as extensions of credit issuances of guarantees or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit made by the insured depository institution to an affiliate must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and that the aggregate amount of covered transactions is limited as to any one affiliate of the bank to 10 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to all of the bank’s affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus in addition transactions between the bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered by the bank to nonaffiliated companies ie at arm’s length 

the cra is a federal law that generally requires an insured depository institution to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments offer products and provide services in each case designed to meet the credit needs of these communities the cra also requires an institution to maintain comprehensive records of cra activities to demonstrate how it is meeting the credit needs of communities these records are subject to periodic examination by the responsible federal banking agency of the institution based on these examinations the agency rates the institution’s compliance with cra as “outstanding” “satisfactory” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance” the cra requires the agency to take into account the record of an institution in meeting the credit needs of the entire communities served including low and moderate income neighborhoods in determining such rating failure of an institution to receive at least a “satisfactory” rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities including acquisitions the bank received a cra rating of “satisfactory” as of its most recent cra examination 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates there are no such restrictions under the fdia on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” further “undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations at december 31 2017  the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized for purposes of the fdia an inability to accept brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity 

deposit insurance 

the fdia requires the bank to pay deposit insurance assessments deposit insurance assessments are affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the federal deposit insurance fund the “dif” the doddfrank act increased the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the dif to 135  and removed the statutory cap on the reserve ratio the fdic subsequently adopted a designated ratio of 2  and may increase that ratio in the future under the fdic’s current deposit insurance assessment methodology the bank is required to pay deposit insurance assessments based on its average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity and various other regulatory factors included in an fdic assessment scorecard 

in march 2016 the board of directors of the fdic approved a final rule to increase the dif reserve ratio to the statutorily required minimum level of 135 percent under a rule adopted by the fdic in 2011 regular assessment rates for all banks decrease after the reserve ratio first reaches 115 percent under the final rule adopted in march 2016 banks with at least 10 billion in assets are subject to a surcharge of 45 cents per 100 of the assessment base after making certain adjustments also after the reserve ratio reaches 115 percent the fdic expects the reserve ratio will likely reach 135 percent after approximately two years of payments of these surcharges the decrease in regular assessment rates and the surcharge for banks with 10 billion in assets both became effective beginning the third quarter of 2016 which is the first quarter after the reserve ratio reached 115 percent 

the fdia creates a depositor preference regime for the resolution of all insured depository institutions including the bank if any such institution is placed into receivership the fdic will pay out of the remaining net assets of the failed institution and only to the extent of such assets first secured creditors to the extent of their security second the administrative expenses of the receivership third all deposits liabilities both insured and uninsured fourth any other general or senior liabilities fifth any obligations subordinated to depositors or general creditors and finally any remaining net assets to shareholders in that capacity 

resolution and recovery planning 

the bank is required annually to submit to the fdic a plan for the bank’s resolution in the event of its failure the plan is designed to enable the fdic if appointed receiver for the bank to resolve the bank under sections 11 and 13 of the fdia in a manner that ensures that its depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the banks failure two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than friday maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of the bank’s assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution the resolution plan requirement is intended to ensure that the fdic has access to all of the material information it needs to resolve the bank efficiently in the event of its failure 

in september 2016 the occ issued final guidance that will require the bank to develop and maintain a recovery plan that identifies triggers and options for responding to a wide range of severe internal and external stress scenarios and for restoring the bank to the extent it is experiencing or is likely to experience considerable financial or operational stress to financial strength and viability in a timely manner the bank will be required to have in place its recovery plan under this guidance by july 1 2018 

heightened standards for risk management governance 

the occ’s heightened standards establish guidelines for the governance and risk management practices of large occregulated institutions including the bank these heightened standards require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risktaking activities provide standards for covered banks’ boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework and describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units independent risk management and internal audit functions the bank believes it complies with the heightened standards 

consumer financial services regulation 

the relationship between us and our us customers is regulated under federal and state consumer protection laws federal laws include the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act hola the fair credit reporting act the “fcra” the grammleachbliley act the “glba” the card act and the doddfrank act these and other federal laws among other things require disclosures of the cost of credit provide substantive consumer rights prohibit discrimination in credit transactions regulate the use of credit report information provide financial privacy protections require safe and sound banking operations prohibit unfair deceptive and abusive practices restrict our ability to raise interest rates on certain credit card balances and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight state and in some cases local laws also may regulate the relationship between us and our us customers in these areas as well as in the areas of collection practices and may provide additional consumer protections moreover we are subject to the servicemembers civil relief act which protects persons called to active military service and their dependents from undue hardship resulting from their military service and the military lending act the “mla” which extends specific protections if an accountholder at the time of account opening is a covered active duty member of the military or certain family members thereof collectively the “covered borrowers” the servicemembers civil relief act applies to all debts incurred prior to the commencement of active duty including credit card and other openend debt and limits the amount of interest including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges other than bona fide insurance that are related to the obligation or liability the mla became effective with respect to our credit card programs on october 3 2017 the mla applies to certain consumer loans including credit extended pursuant to a credit card account and extends specific protections if an accountholder at the time of account opening is a covered active duty member of the military or certain family members thereof collectively the “covered borrowers” these protections include but are not limited to a limit on the military annual percentage rate that can be charged to 36 delivery of certain required disclosures and a prohibition on mandatory arbitration agreements if we were to extend credit to a covered borrower without complying with certain mla provisions the credit card agreement could be void from its inception 

violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers including actual damages restitution and attorneys’ fees federal banking regulators as well as state attorneys general and other state and local consumer protection agencies also may seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies including civil money penalties and fines 

the card act was enacted in 2009 and most of the requirements became effective in 2010 the card act made numerous amendments to the truth in lending act requiring us to make significant changes to many of our business practices including marketing underwriting pricing and billing the card act’s restrictions on our ability to increase interest rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and credit risk ultimately limits our ability to extend credit to new customers and provide additional credit to current customers other card act restrictions such as limitations on late fees have resulted and will continue to result in reduced interest income and loan fee income 

the fcra regulates our use of credit reports and the reporting of information to credit reporting agencies and also provides a standard for lenders to share information with affiliates and certain third parties and to provide firm offers of credit to consumers the fcra also places further restrictions on the use of information shared between affiliates for marketing purposes requires the provision of disclosures to consumers when riskbased pricing is used in a credit decision and requires safeguards to help protect consumers from identity theft 

under hola the bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers in general the bank may not extend credit lease or sell property or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that i the customer obtain or provide some additional credit property or services from or to the bank or synchrony or their subsidiaries or ii the customer may not obtain some other credit property or services from a competitor except in each case to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended certain arrangements are permissible for example the bank may offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products 

the doddfrank act established the cfpb which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair transparent and competitive the cfpb has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the doddfrank act and other federal consumer financial services laws as well as broad supervisory examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services such as us in addition the cfpb has an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the products we offer the system could inform future agency decisions with respect to regulatory enforcement or examination focus there continues to be uncertainty as to how the cfpb’s strategies and priorities will impact our business and our results of operations going forward see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureau’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business ” 

if predispute arbitration provisions are not enforceable or eliminated for whatever reason our exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to our business—litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses ” 

privacy 

we are subject to various privacy information security and data protection laws including requirements concerning security breach notification for example in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the glba and implementing regulations and guidance among other things the glba i imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties ii requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties with certain exceptions and iii requires financial institutions to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches federal and state laws also require us to respond appropriately to data security breaches we have a program to comply with applicable privacy information security and data protection requirements imposed by federal state and foreign laws including the glba see also “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—regulations relating to privacy information security and data protection could increase our costs affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities ” 

money laundering and terrorist financing prevention program 

we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including but not limited to the bank secrecy act and the patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale these controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments the program is coordinated by a compliance officer undergoes an annual independent audit to assess its effectiveness and requires training of employees 

in may 2016 the financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” promulgated a final rule under the bank secrecy act that requires the bank to adopt due diligence procedures to identify and verify a legal entity customer’s beneficial owners at the time a new account is opened and to understand the nature and purpose of the customer relationship the bank will be required to comply with the final rule by may 11 2018 and is currently working on changes to its product and channel strategies application and servicing processes and systems to ensure compliance see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—failure to comply with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us ” 

sanctions programs 

we have a program designed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs including those administered and enforced by ofac these sanctions are usually targeted against foreign countries terrorists international narcotics traffickers and those believed to be involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction these regulations generally require either the blocking of accounts or other property of specified entities or individuals but they may also require the rejection of certain transactions involving specified entities or individuals we maintain policies procedures and other internal controls designed to comply with these sanctions programs 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in “ cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements ” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in “ item 8 financial statements and supplementary data ” of this form 10k report 

our business routinely encounters and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we anticipate discussion about important operational risks that our business encounters can be found in the business descriptions in “ item 1 business ” and the mda section of this form 10k report below we describe certain important strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will affect our future results 

risks relating to our business 

 

macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

key macroeconomic conditions historically have affected our business results of operations and financial condition and are likely to affect them in the future consumer confidence unemployment and housing indicators are among the factors that often impact consumer spending behavior and demand for credit poor economic conditions reduce the usage of our credit cards and other financing products and the average purchase amount of transactions on our credit cards and through our other products which in each case reduces our interest and fee income we rely primarily on interest and fees on our loan receivables to generate our net earnings our interest and fees on our loan receivables was 162 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017  poor economic conditions also adversely affect the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us increasing delinquencies bankruptcies chargeoffs and allowances for loan losses and decreasing recoveries for example our over30 day delinquency rate as a percentage of periodend loan receivables was 825  at december 31 2009 during the financial crisis compared to 467  at december 31 2017  and our fullyear net chargeoff rate was 1126  for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 537  for the year ended december 31 2017  the assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix account maturation as well as broader consumer trends such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness during 2017 these factors contributed to increases in our delinquent accounts and our forecasted net chargeoff rate over the next twelve months we believe the delinquency rate and net chargeoff rate in our portfolio will continue to increase modestly from the credit trends we have experienced in recent years and are likely to increase materially if economic conditions deteriorate 

economic growth in the united states since the recession has been slow and uneven as consumers continue to recover from previously high unemployment rates lower housing values concerns about the level of us government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address this as well as economic and political conditions in the us and global markets a prolonged period of slow economic growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions or broader consumer trends including consumer indebtedness would likely affect consumer spending levels and the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

macroeconomic conditions may also cause net earnings to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of securities analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding the impact of these conditions on our business and this may adversely impact our stock price 

our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners 

substantially all of our revenue is generated from the credit products we provide to customers of our partners pursuant to program agreements we enter into with our partners as a result our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners historically there has been turnover in our partners and we expect this will continue in the future for example during the year ended december 31 2015 we sold certain credit card portfolios associated with retail partners whose program agreements with us were not extended beyond their contractual expiration dates 

program agreements with our retail card partners and national and regional retailer and manufacturer payment solutions partners typically are for multiyear terms these program agreements generally permit our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons including in some cases if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria we fail to achieve certain targets with respect to approvals of new customers as a result of the credit criteria we use we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds or we are not adequately capitalized or certain force majeure events or changes in our ownership occur or a material adverse change in our financial condition occurs a few payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer and manufacturer partners also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us eg several months in addition programs with manufacturers buying groups and industry associations generally are made available to payment solutions partners such as individual retail outlets dealers and merchants under dealer agreements which typically may be terminated at will by the partner on short notice to us eg 15 days 

there is significant competition for our existing partners and our failure to retain our existing larger partner relationships upon the expiration or our earlier loss of a relationship upon the exercise of a partner’s early termination rights or the expiration or termination of a substantial number of smaller partner relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including growth rates and financial condition to the extent we do not acquire new partners of similar size and profitability or otherwise grow our business in addition existing relationships may be renewed with less favorable terms to the company in response to increased competition for such relationships the competition for new partners is also significant and our failure to attract new partners could adversely affect our ability to grow 

a significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our five largest programs gap jcpenney lowe’s sam’s club and walmart accounted in aggregate for 53  of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended december 31 2017  and 49  of loan receivables at december 31 2017  our programs with jcpenney lowes and walmart each accounted for more than 10 of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended december 31 2017 sam’s club is a subsidiary of walmart that is a separate contracting entity with its own program agreement with us which we report separately from the walmart program we expect to have significant concentration in our largest relationships for the foreseeable future see  item 1 business—our sales platforms—retail card partners  

the program agreements generally permit us or our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date under various circumstances as described in the preceding risk factor some of our program agreements also provide that upon expiration or termination our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loans generated with respect to its program and all related customer data the loss of any of our largest partners or a material reduction in the interest and fees we receive from their customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results depend to a significant extent on the active and effective promotion and support of our products by our partners 

our partners generally accept most major credit cards and various other forms of payment and therefore our success depends on their active and effective promotion of our products to their customers we depend on our partners to integrate the use of our credit products into their store culture by training their sales associates about our products having their sales associates encourage their customers to apply for and use our products and otherwise effectively marketing our products in addition although our retail card programs and our payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer partners typically are exclusive with respect to the credit products we offer at that partner some payment solutions programs and most carecredit provider relationships are not exclusive to us and therefore a partner may choose to promote a competitor’s financing over ours depending upon cost availability or attractiveness to consumers or other factors typically we do not have or utilize any recourse against these nonexclusive partners when they do not sufficiently promote our products partners may also implement or fail to implement changes in their systems and technologies that may disrupt the integration between their systems and technologies and ours which could disrupt the use of our products the failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as changes they may make in their business models that negatively impact card usage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition if our partners engage in improper business practices do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements or other contractual arrangements or standards or otherwise diminish the value of our brand we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our results are impacted to a significant extent by the financial performance of our partners 

our ability to generate new loans and the interest and fees and other income associated with them is dependent upon sales of merchandise and services by our partners the retail and healthcare industries in which our partners operate are intensely competitive our partners compete with retailers and department stores in their own geographic areas as well as catalog and internet sales businesses our partners in the healthcare industry compete with other healthcare providers our partners’ sales may decrease or may not increase as we anticipate for various reasons some of which are in the partners’ control and some of which are not for example partner sales may be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions having a national regional or more local effect on consumer spending business conditions affecting a particular partner or industry or catastrophes affecting broad or more discrete geographic areas if our partners’ sales decline for any reason it generally results in lower credit sales and therefore lower loan volume and associated interest and fees and other income for us from their customers in addition if a partner closes some or all of its stores or becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding or if there is a perception that it may become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding its customers who have used our financing products may have less incentive to pay their outstanding balances to us which could result in higher chargeoff rates than anticipated and our costs for servicing its customers’ accounts may increase this risk is particularly acute with respect to our largest partners that account for a significant amount of our interest and fees on loans see “ —a significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations ” moreover if the financial condition of a partner deteriorates significantly or a partner becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding we may not be able to recover for customer returns customer payments made in partner stores or other amounts due to us from the partner a decrease in sales by our partners for any reason or a bankruptcy proceeding involving any of them could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

cyberattacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our partners and our customers we also have arrangements in place with our partners and other third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business continuity programs our facilities and systems and those of our partners and thirdparty service providers are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events we and our partners and thirdparty service providers have experienced all of these events in the past and expect to continue to experience them in the future these events could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services although the impact to date from these events has not had a material adverse effect on us we cannot be sure this will be the case in the future 

information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies including mobile and other connected devices to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime perpetrators of fraud hackers terrorists and others in addition to cyberattacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions that are designed to disrupt key business services such as consumerfacing web sites our successful business performance and marketing efforts may increase our profile and therefore our risk of being targeted for cyberattacks and other security breaches including attacks targeting our key business services and websites we are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources we employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection 

we also face risks related to cyberattacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various thirdparties including our partners retailers that are not our partners where our dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards are used merchant acquiring banks payment processors card networks eg visa and mastercard and our processors eg first data and fiserv some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyberattacks and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure future security breaches or cyberattacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them we also rely on numerous other thirdparty service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them while we regularly conduct security assessments of significant thirdparty service providers we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach 

the access by unauthorized persons to or the improper disclosure by us of confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information software methodologies and business secrets could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition there have been a number of wellpublicized attacks or breaches directed at others in our industry that have heightened concern by consumers generally about the security of using credit cards which have caused some consumers including our customers to use our credit cards less in favor of alternative methods of payment and has led to increased regulatory focus on and potentially new regulations relating to these matters further cyberattacks or other breaches in the future whether affecting us or others could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of our cards and increased costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

adverse financial market conditions or our inability to effectively manage our funding and liquidity risk could have a material adverse effect on our funding liquidity and ability to meet our obligations 

we need to effectively manage our funding and liquidity in order to meet our cash requirements such as daytoday operating expenses extensions of credit to our customers payments of principal and interest on our borrowings and payments on our other obligations our primary sources of funding and liquidity are collections from our customers deposits funds from securitized financings and proceeds from unsecured borrowings if we do not have sufficient liquidity we may not be able to meet our obligations particularly during a liquidity stress event if we maintain or are required to maintain too much liquidity it could be costly and reduce our financial flexibility 

we will need additional financing in the future to refinance any existing debt and finance growth of our business the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as financial market conditions generally including the availability of credit to the financial services industry consumers’ willingness to place money on deposit in the bank our performance and credit ratings and the performance of our securitized portfolios disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital credit or deposit markets such as the uncertainty and volatility experienced in the capital and credit markets during the last financial crisis and more recently arising from the sovereign debt crisis in europe and other economic and political conditions in the global markets and concerning the level of us government debt and fiscal measures that may be taken over the longer term to address these matters may limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance maturing liabilities on desired terms including funding costs in a timely manner or at all as a result we may be forced to delay obtaining funding or be forced to issue or raise funding on undesirable terms which could significantly reduce our financial flexibility and cause us to contract or not grow our business all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions 

in addition at december 31 2017 we had an aggregate of 60 billion  of undrawn credit facilities subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under our securitization programs and an unsecured revolving credit facility our ability to draw on such commitments is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including the applicable securitization trust having sufficient collateral to support the draw and the absence of an early amortization event moreover there are regulatory reforms that have recently been proposed or adopted in the united states and internationally that are intended to address certain issues that affected banks in the last financial crisis these reforms generally referred to as “basel iii” subject banks to more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements to the extent that the basel iii requirements result in increased costs to the banks providing undrawn committed capacity under our securitization programs these costs are likely to be passed on to us in addition in response to basel iii some banks in the market including certain of the private lenders in our securitization programs have added provisions to their credit agreements permitting them to delay disbursement of funding requests for 30 days or more if our bank lenders require delayed disbursements of funding andor higher pricing for committing undrawn capacity to us our cost of funding and access to liquidity could be adversely affected 

while financial market conditions have generally stabilized and improved since the financial crisis there can be no assurance that significant disruptions uncertainties and volatility will not occur in the future if we are unable to continue to finance our business access capital markets and attract deposits on favorable terms and in a timely manner or if we experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

our inability to grow our deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to grow our business 

we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers or through brokerage firms that offer our deposit products to their customers at december 31 2017  we had 427 billion  in direct deposits and 138 billion  in deposits originated through brokerage firms including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger who channels brokerage account deposits to us a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to fund our growth through direct deposits 

the deposit business is highly competitive with intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits we compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits features and benefits of our products the quality of our customer service and the competitiveness of our digital banking capabilities our ability to originate and maintain retail deposits is also highly dependent on the strength of the bank and the perceptions of consumers and others of our business practices and our financial health adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to difficulties in attracting and retaining deposits accounts negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas including lending practices regulatory compliance inadequate protection of customer information or sales and marketing activities and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct 

the demand for the deposit products we offer may also be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns changes in customer preferences reductions in consumers’ disposable income regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products competition from other financial services firms and others that use deposit funding products may affect deposit renewal rates costs or availability changes we make to the rates offered on our deposit products may affect our profitability and liquidity 

the fdia prohibits an insured bank from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “well capitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates there are no such restrictions under the fdia on a bank that is “well capitalized” and at december 31 2017 the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed “well capitalized” for purposes of the fdia however there can be no assurance that the bank will continue to meet those requirements limitations on the bank’s ability to accept brokered deposits for any reason including regulatory limitations on the amount of brokered deposits in total or as a percentage of total assets in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity any limitation on the interest rates the bank can pay on deposits could competitively disadvantage us in attracting and retaining deposits and have a material adverse effect on our business 

a reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

synchronys senior unsecured debt currently is rated bbb stable outlook by fitch ratings inc “fitch” and bbb stable outlook by standard  poor’s “sp” the bank’s senior unsecured debt currently is rated bbb stable outlook by fitch and bbb stable outlook by sp although we have not requested that moody’s investor services inc “moody’s” provide a rating for our senior unsecured debt we believe that if moody’s were to issue a rating on our unsecured debt its rating would be lower than the comparable ratings issued by fitch and sp the ratings for our unsecured debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors that may not be within our control such as macroeconomic conditions and the rating agencies’ perception of the industries in which we operate and the products we offer the ratings of our assetbacked securities are and will continue to be based on a number of factors including the quality of the underlying loan receivables and the credit enhancement structure with respect to each series of assetbacked securities as well as our credit rating as sponsor and servicer of our publicly registered securitization trust these ratings also reflect the various methodologies and assumptions used by the rating agencies which are subject to change and could adversely affect our ratings the rating agencies regularly evaluate our credit ratings as well as the credit ratings of our assetbacked securities a downgrade in our unsecured debt or assetbacked securities credit ratings or investor concerns that a downgrade may occur could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

if the ratings on our assetbacked securities are reduced put on negative watch or withdrawn it may have an adverse effect on the liquidity or the market price of our assetbacked securities and on the cost of or our ability to continue using securitized financings to the extent anticipated 

our inability to securitize our loan receivables would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition 

we use the securitization of loan receivables which involves the transfer of loan receivables to a trust and the issuance by the trust of assetbacked securities to thirdparty investors as a significant source of funding our average level of securitized financings from third parties was 122 billion  and 124 billion  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively for a discussion of our securitization activities see “ item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—funding liquidity and capital resources—funding sources—securitized financings ” and note 5 variable interest entities  to our consolidated financial statements 

although the securitization market for credit cards has been reestablished since the financial crisis that began in 2008 there can be no assurance that the market will not experience future disruptions the extent to which we securitize our loan receivables in the future will depend in part upon the conditions in the securities markets in general and the credit card assetbacked securities market in particular the overall credit quality of our loan receivables and the conformity of the loan receivables and our securitization program to rating agency requirements the costs of securitizing our loan receivables and the legal regulatory accounting and tax requirements governing securitization transactions in the event we are unable to refinance existing assetbacked securities from our publicly registered securitization trust with new securities from the same trust there are structural and regulatory constraints on our ability to refinance these assetbacked securities with bank deposits or other funding at the bank and therefore we would be required to rely on sources outside of the bank which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost a prolonged inability to securitize our loan receivables on favorable terms or at all or to refinance our assetbacked securities would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition 

the occurrence of an early amortization of our securitization facilities would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds 

our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events resulting in the early amortization of our existing securitized financings during an early amortization period principal collections from the loan receivables in our assetbacked securitization trust in which the early amortization event occurred would be applied to repay principal of the trusts assetbacked securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund purchases of newly originated loan receivables this would negatively impact our liquidity including our ability to originate new loan receivables under existing accounts and require us to rely on alternative funding sources which might increase our funding costs or might not be available when needed 

our loss of the right to service or subservice our securitized loan receivables would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds 

synchrony currently acts as servicer with respect to our publicly registered securitization trust  and the bank acts as servicer with respect to our other two securitization trusts if synchrony or the bank as applicable defaults in its servicing obligations an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant assetbacked securities andor synchrony or the bank as applicable could be replaced as servicer servicer defaults include for example the failure of the servicer to make any payment transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents a breach of representations warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents the delegation of the servicer’s duties contrary to the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer such an amortization event would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor 

if either synchrony or the bank defaults in its servicing obligations with respect to any of our three securitization trusts a third party could be appointed as servicer of such trust if a thirdparty servicer is appointed there is no assurance that the third party will engage us as subservicer in which event we would no longer be able to control the manner in which the related trust’s assets are serviced and the failure of a third party to appropriately service such assets could lead to an early amortization event in the affected securitization trust which would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor 

lower payment rates on our securitized loan receivables could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

certain collections from our securitized loan receivables come back to us through our subsidiaries and we use these collections to fund our purchase of newly originated loan receivables to collateralize our securitized financings if payment rates on our securitized loan receivables are lower than they have historically been fewer collections will be remitted to us on an ongoing basis further certain series of our assetbacked securities include a requirement that we accumulate principal collections in a restricted account for a specified number of months prior to the applicable security’s maturity date we are required under the program documents to lengthen this accumulation period to the extent we expect the payment rates to be low enough that the current length of the accumulation period is inadequate to fully fund the restricted account by the applicable security’s maturity date lower payment rates and in particular payment rates that are low enough that we are required to lengthen our accumulation periods could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings funding and liquidity 

changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks at december 31 2017  564  of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer with the remaining 436  at a floating interest rate we fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits assetbacked securities and unsecured debt the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is the prime rate and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the federal funds rate the prime rate and libor or the federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities to the extent we are unable to position the balance sheet naturally or using derivatives to effectively match the interest rates on our assets and liabilities our net earnings could be materially adversely affected 

competitive and regulatory factors may limit our ability to raise interest rates on our loans in addition some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers if interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner or at all our net interest margin could be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay amounts owed to us our floating rate credit products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies bankruptcies chargeoffs allowances for loan losses and decreasing recoveries all of which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity 

we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the net interest income impact of various interest rate scenarios we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our net earnings and could also increase our funding costs and reduce our liquidity especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different from our assumptions for a discussion of interest rate risk sensitivities see “ item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective in mitigating our risks 

our risk management processes and procedures seek to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate risks we have established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor and control the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk including compliance risk and strategic risk credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation we are exposed to both consumer credit risk from our customer loans and institutional credit risk principally from our partners market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet obligations and support business growth operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes people or systems external events ie natural disasters or compliance reputational or legal matters and includes those risks as they relate directly to us as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business strategic risk is the risk from changes in the business environment improper implementation of decisions or inadequate responsiveness to changes in the business environment see “ item 1 business—credit risk management ” and “ risk management ” for additional information on the types of risks affecting our business 

we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework that includes our risk appetite statement era process risk policies procedures and controls reporting requirements and corporate culture and values in conjunction with the risk management accountability incorporated into our integrated risk management framework which includes our governance structure and three distinct lines of defense management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models if the models that we use to manage these risks are ineffective at predicting future losses or are otherwise inadequate we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected in addition the information we use in managing our credit and other risk may be inaccurate or incomplete as a result of error or fraud both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid there may also be risks that exist or that develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated including when processes are changed or new products and services are introduced if our risk management framework does not effectively identify and control our risks we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected and that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business and if they are not accurate or are misinterpreted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business including liquidity and capital planning including stress testing customer selection credit and other risk management pricing reserving and collections management the models may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect for a variety of reasons including as a result of errors in constructing interpreting or using the models or the use of inaccurate assumptions including failures to update assumptions appropriately or in a timely manner our assumptions may be inaccurate for many reasons including that they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and beyond our control eg macroeconomic conditions and their impact on partner and customer behaviors and they often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables factors and other assumptions the errors or inaccuracies in our models may be material and could lead us to make wrong or suboptimal decisions in managing our business and this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and failing to do so may result in high chargeoff rates 

our success depends on our ability to manage our credit risk while attracting new customers with profitable usage patterns we select our customers manage their accounts and establish terms and credit limits using proprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques that are designed to set terms and credit limits to appropriately compensate us for the credit risk we accept while encouraging customers to use their available credit the models and approaches we use to manage our credit risk may not accurately predict future chargeoffs for various reasons discussed in the preceding risk factor 

our ability to manage credit risk and avoid high chargeoff rates also may be adversely affected by economic conditions that may be difficult to predict such as the last financial crisis the assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix account maturation as well as broader consumer trends such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness during 2017 these factors contributed to increases in our delinquent accounts and our forecasted net chargeoff rate over the next twelve months we believe the delinquency rate and net chargeoff rate in our portfolio will continue to increase modestly from the low credit trends we have experienced in recent years and are likely to increase materially if economic conditions deteriorate in addition we remain subject to conditions in the consumer credit environment our credit underwriting and risk management strategies are used to manage our credit exposures however there can be no assurance that those will enable us to avoid high chargeoff levels or delinquencies or that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover actual losses 

a customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders under mortgage credit card and other loans including student loans these changes can result from increases in base lending rates or structured increases in payment obligations and could reduce the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations to other lenders and to us in addition a customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by the restricted availability of credit to consumers generally including reduced and closed lines of credit customers with insufficient cash flow to fund daily living expenses and lack of access to other sources of credit may be more likely to increase their card usage and ultimately default on their payment obligations to us resulting in higher credit losses in our portfolio our collection operations may not compete effectively to secure more of customers’ diminished cash flow than our competitors we may not identify customers who are likely to default on their payment obligations to us and reduce our exposure by closing credit lines and restricting authorizations quickly enough which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition our collection strategy depends in part on the sale of debt to thirdparty buyers regulatory or other factors may adversely affect the pricing of our debt sales or the performance of our thirdparty buyers which may result in higher credit losses in our portfolio at december 31 2017  26  of our portfolio’s loan receivables were from customers with a fico score of 660 or less excluding unrated accounts who typically have higher delinquency and credits losses than consumers with higher fico scores 

our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations and collection regulations competitors’ actions and consumer behavior as well as inadequate collections staffing techniques models and performance of vendors such as collection agencies 

our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to cover losses on our loans 

we maintain an allowance for loan losses a reserve established through a provision for losses charged to expense that we believe is appropriate to provide for incurred losses in our loan portfolio in addition for portfolios we may acquire when we enter into new partner program agreements any deterioration in the performance of the purchased portfolios after acquisition results in incremental loss reserves growth in our loan portfolio generally would lead to an increase in the allowance for loan losses 

the process for establishing an allowance for loan losses is critical to our results of operations and financial condition and requires complex models and judgments including forecasts of economic conditions changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding our loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses we may underestimate our incurred losses and fail to maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to account for these losses in cases where we modify a loan if the modified loans do not perform as anticipated we may be required to establish additional allowances on these loans 

we periodically review and update our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to establish our allowance for loan losses to reflect our view of current conditions moreover our regulators as part of their supervisory function periodically review the methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use for calculating and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses our regulators based on their judgment may conclude that we should modify our methodology models or the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments increase our allowance for loan losses andor recognize further losses we continue to review and evaluate our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use and we will implement further enhancements or changes to them as needed we cannot assure you that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses future increases in the allowance for loan losses or recognized losses as a result of any review update regulatory guidance or otherwise will result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements are incorrect or are required to change our reported results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are required to make various assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements under gaap including for purposes of determining allowances for loan losses asset impairment reserves related to litigation and other legal matters valuation of income and other taxes and regulatory exposures and the amounts recorded for certain contractual payments to be paid to or received from partners and others under contractual arrangements in addition significant assumptions and estimates are involved in determining certain disclosures required under gaap including those involving the fair value of our financial instruments if the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect the actual amounts realized on transactions and balances subject to those estimates will be different and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the financial accounting standards board “fasb” has recently proposed changes to several financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of our financial statements and other areas where assumptions or estimates are required including asu 201613 the standard on accounting for credit losses which is effective for annual and interim reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 as a result of changes to financial accounting or reporting standards whether promulgated or required by the fasb or other regulators we could be required to change certain of the assumptions or estimates we previously used in preparing our financial statements which could materially impact how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition generally for additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements see “ item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting estimates ” and note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 

we may not be able to offset increases in our costs with decreased payments under our retailer share arrangements which could reduce our profitability 

most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the relevant program exceeds a contractually defined threshold although the share arrangements vary by partner these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program based typically on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold however because the threshold and the economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on among other things agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses we may not be able to pass on increases in our actual expenses such as funding costs or operating expenses in the form of reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements and our economic return on a program could be adversely affected while most of our agreements contain retailer share arrangements in some cases where we instead provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts for example on our cobranded credit cards our ability to offset increases in our costs is limited 

competition in the consumer finance industry is intense 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners the competition for partners is intense and becoming more competitive our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as alliance data systems american express capital one jpmorgan chase citibank td bank and wells fargo and to a lesser extent potential partners’ own inhouse financing capabilities some of our competitors are substantially larger have substantially greater resources and may offer a broader range of products and services we compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors including program financial and other terms underwriting standards marketing expertise service levels product and service offerings including incentive and loyalty programs technological capabilities and integration brand and reputation in addition some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting eg new account approval customer service and collections and other core banking responsibilities that we retain but some partners may prefer to handle as a result of competition we may be unable to acquire new partners lose existing relationships to competing companies or find it more costly to maintain our existing relationships 

our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain customers and generate usage of our products by them the consumer credit and payments industry is highly competitive and we face an increasingly dynamic industry as emerging technologies enter the marketplace as a form of payment our products compete with cash checks debit cards general purpose credit cards including visa and mastercard american express and discover card other private label card brands and to a certain extent prepaid cards we also compete with nontraditional providers such as financial technology companies in the future we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies such as apple pay android pay chase pay samsung pay and square to the extent that our products are not accepted in or compatible with such technologies we may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry we compete for customers and their usage of our products and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances based on a number of factors including pricing interest rates and fees product offerings credit limits incentives including loyalty programs and customer service although we offer a variety of consumer credit products some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services including home and automobile loans debit cards and bank branch atm access which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitors advantages including a more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers operational efficiencies more versatile technology platforms broadbased local distribution capabilities and lowercost funding in addition some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage customer attrition from any or all of our credit products or any lowering of the pricing of our products by reducing interest rates or fees in order to retain customers could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings 

in our retail deposits business we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct banking competitors we compete for deposits with traditional banks and in seeking to grow our direct banking business we compete with other banks that have direct banking models similar to ours such as ally financial american express capital one 360 ing discover goldman sachs nationwide sallie mae and usaa competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors 

if we are unable to compete effectively for partners customer usage or deposits our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in that market than a more diversified company 

our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit as a result we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular to us consumer credit than a more diversified company for example our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the us economy consumer spending and consumer credit we are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at consumer credit or the specific consumer credit products that we offer including promotional financing due to our carecredit platform we are also more susceptible to increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions targeted at healthcare related procedures or services in contrast to other industries our business concentration could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services 

our industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technologies products services and consumer preferences a key part of our financial success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services including with respect to loyalty programs mobile and point of sale technologies and new synchronybranded bank deposit and credit products realizing the benefits of those products and services is uncertain we may not assign the appropriate level of resources priority or expertise to the development and commercialization of these new products services or enhancements our ability to develop acquire or commercialize competitive technologies products or services on acceptable terms or at all may be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert in addition success is dependent on factors such as partner and customer acceptance adoption and usage competition the effectiveness of marketing programs the availability of appropriate technologies and business processes and regulatory approvals success of a new product service or enhancement also may depend upon our ability to deliver it on a large scale which may require a significant investment 

we also may select utilize and invest in technologies products and services that ultimately do not achieve widespread adoption and therefore are not as attractive or useful to our partners customers and service partners as we anticipate or partners may not recognize the value of our new products and services or believe they justify any potential costs or disruptions associated with implementing them in addition because our products and services typically are marketed through our partners if our partners are unwilling or unable to effectively implement our new technologies products services or enhancements we may be unable to grow our business competitors may also develop or adopt technologies or introduce innovations that change the markets we operate in and make our products less competitive and attractive to our partners and customers 

in any event we may not realize the benefit of new technologies products services or enhancements for many years or competitors may introduce more compelling products services or enhancements our failure to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products services or enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may not realize the value of acquisitions and strategic investments that we pursue and such investments could divert resources or introduce unforeseen risks to our business 

we will acquire new partners and may execute strategic acquisitions or partnerships or make other strategic investments in businesses products technologies or platforms to enhance or grow our business these acquisitions and strategic investments may introduce new costs or liabilities which could impact our ability to grow or maintain acceptable performance 

we may be unable to integrate systems personnel or technologies from our acquisitions and strategic investments these acquisitions and strategic investments may also present unforeseen legal regulatory or other challenges that we may not be able to manage effectively the planning and integration of an acquisition including of a new partner or credit card portfolio partnership or investment may shift employee time and other resources which could impair our ability to focus on our core business 

acquisitions and strategic investments may not perform as expected due to lack of acceptance by partners customers or employees higher than forecasted costs or losses lengthy transition periods synergies or savings not being realized and a variety of other factors this may result in a delay or unrealized benefit or in some cases increased costs or other unforeseen risks to our business 

reductions in interchange fees may reduce the competitive advantages our private label credit card products currently have by virtue of not charging interchange fees and would reduce our income from those fees 

interchange is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the network’s infrastructure and payment facilitation and which are paid to credit card issuers to compensate them for the risk they bear in lending money to customers we earn interchange fees on dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card transactions but we typically do not charge or earn interchange fees from our partners or customers on our private label credit card products 

merchants trying to decrease their operating expenses have sought to and have had some success at lowering interchange rates several recent events and actions indicate a continuing increase in focus on interchange by both regulators and merchants beyond pursuing litigation legislation and regulation merchants are also pursuing alternate payment platforms as a means to lower payment processing costs to the extent interchange fees are reduced one of our current competitive advantages with our partners — that we typically do not charge interchange fees when our private label credit card products are used to purchase our partners’ goods and services — may be reduced moreover to the extent interchange fees are reduced our income from those fees will be lower we received 653 million  of interchange fees for the year ended december 31 2017  as a result a reduction in interchange fees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition for our dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards we are subject to the operating regulations and procedures set forth by the interchange network and our failure to comply with these operating regulations which may change from time to time could subject us to various penalties or fees or the termination of our license to use the interchange network all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

fraudulent activity associated with our products and services could negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and cause the use of our products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase 

we are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with partners customers and third parties handling customer information our fraudrelated operational losses increased in 2017 and were 313 million  203 million  and 219 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively our fraudrelated losses have shifted away from counterfeit fraud losses with the implementation of the emv chip in dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards and towards application fraud and mailphone fraud including as a result of wellpublicized security breaches at retailers unrelated to us our products are susceptible to application fraud because among other things we provide immediate access to the credit line at the time of approval in addition sales on the internet and through mobile channels are becoming a larger part of our business and fraudulent activity is higher as a percentage of sales in those channels than in stores dual cards general purpose cobranded credit cards and private label credit cards are susceptible to different types of fraud and depending on our product channel mix including as a result of the introduction if any of a synchronybranded general purpose credit card we may continue to experience variations in or levels of fraudrelated expense that are different from or higher than that experienced by some of our competitors or the industry generally 

the risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry in general and credit card fraud identity theft and related crimes are likely to continue to be prevalent and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated our resources technologies and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud high profile fraudulent activity also could negatively impact our brand and reputation which could negatively impact the use of our cards and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention such as increased customer notification requirements which could increase our costs and also negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and could lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk which could increase our costs 

the failure of third parties to provide various services that are important to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

some services important to our business are outsourced to thirdparty vendors for example our credit card transaction processing production and related services including the printing and mailing of customer statements are handled by first data and the technology platform for our online retail deposits is managed by fiserv first data fiserv and in some cases other thirdparty vendors are the sole source or one of a limited number of sources of the services they provide for us it would be difficult and disruptive for us to replace some of our thirdparty vendors particularly first data and fiserv in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future as a result of their financial or business conditions or otherwise and our business and operations likely would be materially adversely affected first data has publicly disclosed that it is highly leveraged our principal agreement with first data expires in november 2026 unless it is terminated earlier or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof our principal agreement with fiserv expires in march 26 2020 unless it is terminated earlier or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof in addition if a thirdparty provider fails to provide the services we require fails to meet contractual requirements such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations or suffers a cyberattack or other security breach our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

disruptions in the operation of our computer systems and data centers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ability to deliver products and services to our partners and our customers service our loans and otherwise operate our business and comply with applicable laws depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems and data centers as well as those of our partners and thirdparty service providers these computer systems and data centers may encounter service interruptions at any time due to system or software failure natural disaster or other reasons in addition the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain current and integrate new systems may also cause service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause our failure to comply with applicable laws all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer credit industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies and business processes may be better than those we currently use the pace of technology change is high and our industry is intensely competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete and better ones become available a failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less competitive all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have international operations that subject us to various international risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs 

we have international operations primarily in india the philippines and canada and some of our thirdparty service providers provide services to us from other countries all of which subject us to a number of international risks including among other things sovereign volatility and sociopolitical instability for example the philippines has in the past experienced severe political and social instability any future political or social instability in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 

us regulations also govern various aspects of the international activities of domestic corporations and increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs any failure on our part or the part of our service providers to comply with applicable us regulations as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in which we or they operate could result in fines penalties injunctions or other similar restrictions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are alleged to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights owned by others or are not able to protect our intellectual property our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competitors or other third parties may allege that we or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us infringe on their intellectual property rights we also may face allegations that our employees have misappropriated intellectual property of their former employers or other third parties given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation an assertion of an infringement claim against us may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim even if we ultimately prevail pay significant money damages lose significant revenues be prohibited from using the relevant systems processes technologies or other intellectual property cease offering certain products or services or incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses moreover it has become common in recent years for individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees in addition although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs such indemnifying party may refuse or be unable to uphold its contractual obligations 

moreover we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information including copyrights trademarks patents trade secrets and controls on access and distribution these measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage and in any event we may be required to litigate to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information from misappropriation or infringement by others which is expensive could cause a diversion of resources and may not be successful third parties may challenge invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property or our intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages our competitors or other third parties may independently design around or develop similar technology or otherwise duplicate our services or products such that we could not assert our intellectual property rights against them in addition our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure 

we have launched our brand “synchrony” and expect to spend significant amounts over the next few years promoting the brand we recently filed trademark applications to protect our name in the united states and certain other countries but the registrations of some of these trademarks are not complete and they may ultimately not become registered our use of our name for our existing or any new products in the united states or other countries may be challenged by third parties and we may become involved in legal proceedings to protect or defend our rights with respect to our name all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses 

our business is subject to increased risks of litigation and regulatory actions as a result of a number of factors and from various sources including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry 

in the normal course of business from time to time we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business activities certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in addition while historically the arbitration provision in our customer agreements generally has limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future there may also be legislative administrative or regulatory efforts to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of predispute arbitration clauses or we may be compelled as a result of competitive pressure or reputational concerns to voluntarily eliminate predispute arbitration clauses if the arbitration provision is not enforceable or eliminated for whatever reason our exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly 

we are also involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business collectively “regulatory matters” which could subject us to significant fines penalties obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses diminished earnings and damage to our reputation the current environment of additional regulation increased regulatory compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may prevent or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services there is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will not in the future affect how we conduct our business and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we contest liability andor the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter the outcome of pending and future matters could be material to our results of operations financial condition and cash flows depending on among other factors the level of our earnings for that period and could adversely affect our business and reputation for a discussion of certain legal proceedings see “ item 1   business—regulation—consumer financial services regulation ” note 16 legal proceedings and regulatory matters  to our consolidated financial statements and “ item 3   legal proceedings ” 

in addition to litigation and regulatory matters from time to time through our operational and compliance controls we identify compliance issues that require us to make operational changes and depending on the nature of the issue result in financial remediation to impacted cardholders these selfidentified issues and voluntary remediation payments could be significant depending on the issue and the number of cardholders impacted they also could generate litigation or regulatory investigations that subject us to additional adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business 

recently financial services companies have been experiencing increased reputational risk as consumers take issue with certain of their practices or judgments maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining customers partners investors and employees in particular adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could also make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy of increasing retail deposits at the bank and may lead to decreases in deposits harm to our reputation can arise from many sources including employee misconduct misconduct by our partners outsourced service providers or other counterparties litigation or regulatory actions failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality inadequate protection of customer information and compliance failures negative publicity regarding us or others engaged in a similar business or activities whether or not accurate may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and motivate key officers and employees 

our success depends in large part on our ability to retain recruit and motivate key officers and employees our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for senior executives in the financial services and payment industry is intense we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel guidelines issued by the federal banking regulators prohibits our payment of excessive compensation or compensation that could lead to our material financial loss to our executives employees and directors in addition proposed rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the doddfrank act would limit the type and structure of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our senior executives and persons deemed significant risktakers these restrictions could negatively impact our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting retaining and motivating key personnel failure to retain talented senior leadership could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions and we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives may be proposed such as the recent tax reform in the united states which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our deferred tax assets tax positions andor our tax liabilities in addition us federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our historical tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in defending our positions in connection with any such challenge 

in addition there is some uncertainty around the interpretation of certain provisions of the recent us tax reform on december 22 2017 the tax act was signed into law the tax act includes numerous changes to existing tax law including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 while the tax act is expected to have a significant positive impact on our aftertax results technical corrections or other forthcoming guidance could change how we interpret provisions of the tax act which may impact our effective tax rate and could affect our deferred tax assets tax positions andor our tax liabilities 

state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could change and adversely affect our results of operations 

state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could adversely affect our results of operations retailers collect sales tax from retail customers and remit those collections to the applicable states when customers fail to repay their loans including the amount of sales tax advanced by us to the merchant on their behalf we are entitled in some cases to seek a refund of the amount of sales tax from the applicable state sales tax laws and regulations enacted by the various states are subject to interpretation and our compliance with such laws is routinely subject to audit and review by the states audit risk is concentrated in several states and these states are conducting ongoing audits the outcomes of ongoing and any future audits and changes in the states’ interpretation of the sales tax laws and regulations involving the recovery of tax on bad debts could materially adversely impact our results of operations 

we could have a material indemnification obligation to ge under the tssa if we cause the splitoff from ge or certain preliminary transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment or in the case of certain significant transfers of our stock following the splitoff from ge 

ge completed its exit from its investment in us in an exchange offer that concluded in november 2015 resulting in our splitoff from ge the splitoff was designed to qualify for tax­free treatment to ge and its shareholders under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” ge obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service “irs” regarding certain issues relating to the tax­free treatment of the splitoff and a series of preliminary transactions that occurred prior to implementing the exchange offer although the irs private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the irs private letter ruling the irs private letter ruling addresses only certain aspects of the transaction as a result ge obtained an opinion from tax counsel confirming the taxfree treatment of the splitoff the opinion is based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by us and ge if any of those factual representations or assumptions in the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion are untrue or incomplete in any material respect any undertaking is not complied with or the facts upon which the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion was based are materially different from the facts at the time of the distribution the splitoff may not qualify for tax­free treatment opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs as a result the conclusions expressed in the opinion of counsel could be challenged by the irs and if the irs prevails in such challenge the tax consequences of the splitoff could be materially less favorable if the splitoff or any of the preliminary transactions is determined to be taxable ge and its shareholders could incur significant tax liabilities and under the tssa we entered into with ge we may be required to indemnify ge for any liabilities incurred by ge if the liabilities are caused by any action or inaction undertaken by us following the initial public offering of our common stock “ipo” in 2014 or as a result of any direct or indirect transfers of our stock following the exchange offer 

in order to preserve the tax­free status of the splitoff and the preliminary transactions to ge the tssa includes a provision generally prohibiting us from taking any action or inaction that is within our control other than actions or inactions that implemented the splitoff or certain preliminary transactions or actions or inactions that are consented to by ge or are at the direction of ge that would cause the splitoff or the preliminary transactions to become taxable and providing for an indemnity obligation from us to ge for tax liabilities incurred by ge as a result of a breach of these provisions by us or as a result of any direct or indirect transfers of our stock following the exchange offer as a result we may not as part of a plan that includes the exchange offer enter into certain mergers or other change of control transactions 

risks relating to regulation 

 

our business is subject to government regulation supervision examination and enforcement which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business including our relationships with our customers is subject to regulation supervision and examination under us federal state and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending and collection practices treatment of our customers safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure liquidity dividends and other capital distributions transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel as a savings and loan holding company and financial holding company synchrony is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as a large provider of consumer financial services we are also subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb the bank is a federally chartered savings association as such the bank is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ which is its primary regulator and by the cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic we including the bank are regularly reviewed and examined by our respective regulators which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require response and attention see “ item 1   business—regulation ” for more information about the regulations applicable to us 

banking laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect federally insured deposits the dif and the banking system as a whole and not intended to protect our stockholders noteholders or creditors if we fail to satisfy applicable laws and regulations our respective regulators have broad discretion to enforce those laws and regulations including with respect to the operation of our business required capital levels payment of dividends and other capital distributions engaging in certain activities and making acquisitions and investments our regulators also have broad discretion with respect to the enforcement of applicable laws and regulations including through enforcement actions that could subject us to civil money penalties customer remediation programs increased compliance costs and limits or prohibitions on our ability to offer certain products and services or to engage in certain activities in addition to the extent we undertake actions requiring regulatory approval or nonobjection our regulators may make their approval or nonobjection subject to conditions or restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition any other actions taken by our regulators could also have a material adverse impact on our business reputation and brand results of operations and financial condition moreover some of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less restrictive statutory andor regulatory regimes which may have the effect of providing them with a competitive advantage over us 

new laws regulations policies or practical changes in enforcement of existing laws regulations or policies applicable to our business or our own reexamination of our current practices could adversely impact our profitability limit our ability to continue existing or pursue new business activities require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with customers affect retention of our key personnel or expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs andor customer remediation these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for example the cfpb has broad authority over our business see “ —there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureau’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business ” 

we are also subject to potential enforcement and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties and fines customer remediation programs and increased compliance costs as well as damage our reputation and brand and limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices for a discussion of risks related to actions or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies see “ —risks relating to our business—litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses ” 

the doddfrank act has had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the doddfrank act was enacted on july 21 2010 while certain provisions in the act were effective immediately many of the provisions require implementing regulations to be effective the doddfrank act and regulations promulgated thereunder have had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition for example the doddfrank act and related regulations restrict certain business practices impose more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements as well as additional costs including increased compliance costs and increased costs of funding raised through the issuance of assetbacked securities on us and impact the value of our assets in addition the doddfrank act requires us to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution we control such as the bank such support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interest of synchrony or its stockholders noteholders or creditors we describe certain provisions of the doddfrank act and other legislative and regulatory developments in “ item 1   business—regulation ” federal agencies continue to promulgate regulations to implement the doddfrank act and these regulations may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some provisions of the doddfrank act still require the adoption of additional rules to implement in addition the doddfrank act mandates multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action as a result the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations remains unclear and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureau’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business 

the cfpb which commenced operations in july 2011 has broad authority over our business this includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions such as us for compliance the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory supervisory and enforcement authority the federal reserve board and the occ and state government agencies may also invoke their supervisory and enforcement authorities to prevent unfair and deceptive acts or practices these federal and state agencies are authorized to remediate violations of consumer protection laws in a number of ways including collecting civil money penalties and fines and providing for customer restitution the cfpb also engages in consumer financial education requests data and promotes the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities in addition the cfpb maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the products we offer this system could inform future cfpb decisions with respect to its regulatory enforcement or examination focus 

there continues to be uncertainty as to how the cfpb’s strategies and priorities including in both its examination and enforcement processes will impact our business and our results of operations going forward actions by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services including deferred interest products making them less attractive to consumers and less profitable to us and also restricting our ability to offer them for example on may 9 2017 the bank received a civil investigative demand from the cfpb seeking information related to the marketing and servicing of deferred interest promotions in addition since 2013 the bank has entered into two consent orders with the cfpb  one in 2013 the 2013 cfpb consent order” which required us to provide remediation to certain customers and to make a number of changes to our carecredit training sales marketing and servicing practices and another in 2014 together with the 2013 consent order the consent orders with respect to a debt cancellation product and sales practices and an unrelated issue that arose from the bank’s selfidentified omission of certain spanishspeaking customers and customers residing in puerto rico from two offers that were made to certain delinquent customers the bank’s resolutions with the cfpb does not preclude other regulators or state attorneys general from seeking additional monetary or injunctive relief with respect to carecredit and any such relief could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

although we have committed significant resources to enhancing our compliance programs changes by the cfpb in regulatory expectations interpretations or practices or interpretations that are different or stricter than ours or those adopted in the past by other regulators could increase the risk of additional enforcement actions fines and penalties for example in december 2015 the cfpb published its second biennial report reviewing the consumer credit card market in the report the cfpb identified areas of concern for consumers including deferred interest products subprime specialist credit card issuers and unexpected rate increases with respect to variable interest rate products in addition the report analyzed issues regarding debt sales and debt collection practices the adequacy and availability of online disclosures as well as of the disclosures associated with rewards products and grace periods the biennial report published in december 2017 also discussed these areas actions by the cfpb with respect to any of these areas could result in requirements to alter our products and services that may make them less attractive to consumers or less profitable to us 

future actions by the cfpb or other regulators against us or our competitors that discourage the use of products we offer or suggest to consumers the desirability of other products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of customers if the cfpb changes regulations which it adopted in the past or which were adopted in the past by other regulators and transferred to the cfpb by the doddfrank act or modifies through supervision or enforcement past related regulatory guidance or interprets existing regulations in a different or stricter manner than they have been interpreted in the past by us the industry or other regulators our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if future regulatory or legislative restrictions or prohibitions are imposed that affect our ability to offer promotional financing including deferred interest for certain of our products or require us to make significant changes to our business practices and we are unable to develop compliant alternatives with acceptable returns these restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the doddfrank act authorizes state officials to enforce regulations issued by the cfpb and to enforce the act’s general prohibition against unfair deceptive or abusive practices this could make it more difficult than in the past for federal financial regulators to declare state laws that differ from federal standards to be preempted to the extent that states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or state officials and courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer laws that differ from those adopted by the cfpb we may be required to alter or cease offering products or services in some jurisdictions which would increase compliance costs and reduce our ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide and we may be subject to a higher risk of state enforcement actions 

failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

synchrony and the bank must meet rules for capital adequacy as discussed in “ item 1 business—regulation ” as a standalone savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to capital requirements similar to those that apply to the bank we cannot predict the effects of these capital requirements on synchrony in addition synchrony and the bank may be subject to increasingly stringent capital adequacy standards in the future 

synchrony and the bank must also comply with regulatory requirements related to the maintenance management monitoring and reporting of liquidity as discussed in “ item 1 business—regulation ” these liquidity requirements are new and synchrony and the bank may become subject to additional liquidity requirements in the future we cannot predict the effects of such liquidity requirements on synchrony synchrony and the bank are required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the occ’s and the federal reserve board’s stress test regulations the bank and synchrony are required to use stresstesting methodologies providing for results under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress in addition although as a savings and loan holding company synchrony currently is not subject to the federal reserve board’s ccar rule the federal reserve board may in the future require synchrony to comply with the ccar process or some modified version of the ccar process under such process   the federal reserve board would measure synchronys regulatory capital levels under various stress scenarios further while as a savings and loan holding company synchrony currently is not subject to the federal reserve board’s capital planning rule synchrony prepares and submits a form of capital plan to the federal reserve board for its review and synchrony may in the future be required to seek the federal reserve board’s review and approval of its capital plan consistent with the capital planning rule to the extent synchrony is made subject to the ccar process or the capital planning rule synchronys ability to return capital to shareholders or to reinvest capital in its business may be curtailed 

if synchrony or the bank fails to meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements its operations results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected among other things failure by synchrony or the bank to maintain its status as “well capitalized” or otherwise meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements could compromise our competitive position and result in restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board or the occ including potentially on the bank’s ability to engage in certain activities these could include restrictions on the bank’s ability to enter into transactions with affiliates accept brokered deposits grow its assets engage in material transactions extend credit in certain highly leveraged transactions amend or change its charter bylaws or accounting methods pay interest on its liabilities without regard to regulatory caps on the rates that may be paid on deposits and pay dividends or repurchase stock in addition failure to maintain the well capitalized status of the bank could result in our having to invest additional capital in the bank which could in turn require us to raise additional capital the market and demand for and cost of our assetbacked securities also could be adversely affected by failure to meet current or future capital requirements 

we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness 

we are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock by the federal reserve board which has broad authority to review our capital planning and risk management processes and our current projected and stressed capital levels and to object to any capital action that the federal reserve board considers to be unsafe or unsound in addition the declaration and amount of any future dividends to holders of our common stock or stock repurchases will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on many factors including the financial condition earnings capital and liquidity requirements of us and the bank applicable regulatory requirements corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant if we are unable to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of synchrony financial see “ item 1   businessregulation—savings and loan holding company regulationdividends and stock repurchases ” 

we rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity including to pay our obligations under our indebtedness and other indebtedness as they become due and federal law limits the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us for example occ regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital including payment of dividends stock redemptions and repurchases cashout mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account the bank must obtain the occ’s approval prior to making a capital distribution in certain circumstances including if the bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements or will not do so as a result of the proposed capital distribution or certain net income requirements in addition the bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared dividend or other distribution with the federal reserve board the federal reserve board or the occ may object to a capital distribution if among other things the bank is or as a result of such dividend or distribution would be undercapitalized or the federal reserve board or occ has safety and soundness concerns additional restrictions on bank dividends may apply if the bank fails the qtl test the application of these restrictions on the bank’s ability to pay dividends involves broad discretion on the part of our regulators limitations on the bank’s payments of dividends and other distributions and payments that we receive from the bank could reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to pay dividends or our obligations under our indebtedness see “ item 1   business—regulation—savings association regulation—dividends and stock repurchases ” and “ —activities ” 

regulations relating to privacy information security and data protection could increase our costs affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities 

we are subject to various privacy information security and data protection laws including requirements concerning security breach notification and we could be negatively impacted by them for example in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the glba and implementing regulations and guidance among other things the glba i imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties ii requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties with certain exceptions and iii requires financial institutions to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches 

moreover various united states federal banking regulatory agencies states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual consumer regulatory andor law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach many of these requirements also apply broadly to our partners that accept our cards in many countries that have yet to impose data security breach notification requirements regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data security breaches 

furthermore legislators andor regulators in the united states and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy data protection and information securityrelated practices our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer andor employee information and some of our current or planned business activities this could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives in the united states this includes increased privacyrelated enforcement activity at the federal level by the federal trade commission as well as at the state level such as with regard to mobile applications in the european union this includes the general data protection regulation effective may 2018 

compliance with current or future privacy data protection and information security laws including those regarding security breach notification affecting customer andor employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services such as products or services that involve us sharing information with third parties or storing sensitive credit card information which could materially and adversely affect our profitability our failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory investigations and government actions litigation fines or sanctions consumer or partner actions and damage to our reputation and our brand all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our use of thirdparty vendors and our other ongoing thirdparty business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention 

we regularly use thirdparty vendors and subcontractors as part of our business we also have substantial ongoing business relationships with our partners and other third parties these types of thirdparty relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic and our consumer financial services regulator the cfpb regulatory guidance requires us to enhance our due diligence ongoing monitoring and control over our thirdparty vendors and subcontractors and other ongoing thirdparty business relationships including with our partners in certain cases we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors andor their subcontractors to meet these enhanced requirements which could increase our costs we expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our thirdparty relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships as a result if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our thirdparty vendors and subcontractors or other ongoing thirdparty business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately we could be subject to enforcement actions including the imposition of civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation 

failure to comply with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us 

we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including but not limited to the bank secrecy act and the patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale these controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments we cannot be sure our programs and controls will be effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in may 2016 the fincen promulgated a final rule under the bank secrecy act that requires the bank to adopt due diligence procedures to identify and verify a legal entity customer’s beneficial owners at the time a new account is opened and to understand the nature and purpose of the customer relationship the bank will be required to comply with the final rule by may 11 2018 and is currently working on changes to its product and channel strategies application and servicing processes and systems to ensure compliance

as a savings and loan holding company our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or to repurchase our stock is subject to regulation by the federal reserve board in addition as a holding company we rely significantly on dividends distributions and other payments from the bank to fund dividends to our stockholders the ability of the bank to make dividends and other distributions and payments to us is subject to regulation by the occ and the federal reserve board see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us ” and “ —we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness ”

introduction and business overview 

 

we   are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the united states we provide a range of credit products through programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers local merchants manufacturers buying groups industry associations and healthcare service providers which we refer to as our “partners” during 2017  we financed 1318  billion of purchase volume and at december 31 2017  we had 819  billion of loan receivables and 745 million active accounts 

we offer our credit products primarily through our whollyowned subsidiary synchrony bank the bank in addition through the bank we offer directly to retail and commercial customers a range of deposit products insured by the fdic we have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities at december 31 2017  we had 565  billion in deposits which represented 73  of our total funding sources 

in november 2015 synchrony financial became a standalone savings and loan holding company following the completion of ges exchange offer in which ge exchanged shares of ge common stock for all of the shares of our common stock it owned the “separation” 

our sales platforms 

 

we conduct our operations through a single business segment profitability and expenses including funding costs loan losses and operating expenses are managed for the business as a whole substantially all of our operations are within the united states we offer our credit products through three sales platforms retail card payment solutions and carecredit those platforms are organized by the types of products we offer and the partners we work with and are measured on interest and fees on loans loan receivables new accounts and other sales metrics see “ item 1 business—our sales platforms ”   

retail card 

retail card is a leading provider of private label credit cards and also provides dual cards general purpose cobranded credit cards and small and mediumsized business credit products we offer one or more of these products primarily through 29  national and regional retailers with which we have ongoing program agreements the average length of our relationship with these retail card partners is 20  years retail card’s revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned when our dual card or general purpose cobranded credit cards are used outside of our partners sales channels and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products less loyalty program payments in addition the majority of our retailer share arrangements which generally provide for payment to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractuallydefined threshold are with partners in the retail card sales platform substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard terms 

payment solutions 

payment solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans payment solutions offers these products through participating partners consisting of national and regional retailers local merchants manufacturers buying groups and industry associations substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing payment solutions’ revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables including “merchant discounts” which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of foregone interest income associated with promotional financing 

carecredit 

carecredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for health and personal care procedures products or services at december 31 2017  we had a network of carecredit providers and healthfocused retailers that collectively have over 210000  locations the vast majority of which are individual or small groups of independent healthcare providers through which we offer a carecredit branded private label credit card in october 2017 we also announced the launch of our carecredit dual card offering substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing carecredit’s revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables including merchant discounts 

our credit products 

 

through our platforms we offer three principal types of credit products credit cards commercial credit products and consumer installment loans see “ item 1 business  our credit products ” 

credit cards 

we offer the following principal types of credit cards 

 commercial credit products 

we offer private label cards and dual cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings we also offer a commercial payinfull accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers we offer our commercial credit products primarily through our retail card platform to the commercial customers of our retail card partners 

installment loans 

in payment solutions we originate installment loans to consumers and a limited number of commercial customers in the united states primarily in the power products market motorcycles atvs and lawn and garden installment loans are closedend credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments installment loans are assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates 

business trends and conditions 

 

we believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions including the following 

 a total of 26  of our 29  retail card program agreements now have an expiration date in 2020 or beyond these 26  program agreements represented in the aggregate 79  of both our retail card interest and fees on loans for the year ended december 31 2017  and of our retail card loan receivables at december 31 2017  





seasonality 

 

in our retail card and payment solutions platforms we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down 

the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations delinquency metrics and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods these fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year 

in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net chargeoff rates in the first and second quarters our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net chargeoff rates in the third and fourth quarters because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in chargeoffs as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end consistent with this historical experience we generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period as compared to the end of a calendar year in addition despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end reflecting these same seasonal trends

the following table sets forth certain other financial and statistical data for the periods indicated 

 

 

average balance sheet 

the following table sets forth information for the periods indicated regarding average balance sheet data which are used in the discussion of interest income interest expense and net interest income that follows 

 



 the following table sets forth the amount of changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in average volume and average yieldrate variances due to changes in both average volume and average yieldrate have been allocated between the average volume and average yieldrate variances on a consistent basis based upon the respective percentage changes in average volume and average yieldrate 



interest income 

interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans which includes merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities we include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over a oneyear period and recorded in interest and fees on loans for noncredit card receivables direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans 

we analyze interest income as a function of two principal components average interestearning assets and yield on average interestearning assets key drivers of average interestearning assets include 

 key drivers of yield on average interestearning assets include 

 interest income increased by 1629 million  or 110  for the year ended   december 31 2017  and by 1550 million or 117 for the year ended december 31 2016 these increases were driven primarily by growth in our average loan receivables 

average interestearning assets   



  

the increase in average loan receivables of 103  for the year ended   december 31 2017  was driven primarily by higher purchase volume of 51  and average active account growth of 45  

the increase in average loan receivables of 113 for the year ended   december 31 2016  was driven primarily by higher purchase volume of 104 average active accounts increased 68 to 669 million for the year ended december 31 2016 and the average balances per these active accounts increased 42 

yield on average interestearning assets   

the yield on average interestearning assets increased for the year ended   december 31 2017  primarily due to an increase in the percentage of interestearning assets attributable to loan receivables and a slight increase in the yield on our average loan receivables of 3 basis points to 2142  for the year ended   december 31 2017  

the yield on average interestearning assets increased for the year ended   december 31 2016  primarily due to an increase in the percentage of interestearning assets attributable to loan receivables the yield on our average loan receivables remained relatively flat at 2139  for the year ended   december 31 2016  as slightly lower payment rates were offset by growth in promotional balances 

interest expense 

interest expense is incurred on our interestbearing liabilities which consisted of interestbearing deposit accounts borrowings of consolidated securitization entities senior unsecured notes and the bank term loan 

key drivers of interest expense include 

 interest expense increased by 143 million  or 115  for the year ended   december 31 2017  primarily driven by the growth in our deposit liabilities our cost of funds increased to 190  for the year ended   december 31 2017  compared to 185  for the year ended   december 31 2016  primarily due to higher benchmark interest rates 

interest expense increased by 113 million  or 100  for the year ended   december 31 2016  primarily driven by the growth in our deposit liabilities our cost of funds increased to 185  for the year ended   december 31 2016  compared to 183  for the year ended   december 31 2015  primarily due to higher shortterm benchmark rates 

average interestbearing liabilities 



the increase in average interestbearing liabilities for the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily driven by growth in our direct deposits 

the increase in average interestbearing liabilities for the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily driven by growth in our direct deposits partially offset by the repayment of thirdparty debt and lower securitized financings 

net interest income 

net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense 

net interest income increased by 1486  million or 110  for the year ended   december 31 2017  and by 1437  million or 119  for the year ended   december 31 2016  primarily driven by higher average loan receivables 

retailer share arrangements 

most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold we also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements for example on our cobranded credit cards all of these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products although the retailer share arrangements vary by partner these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program based typically on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold the threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on among other things agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses and therefore increases in our actual expenses such as funding costs or operating expenses may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have generally increased in recent years primarily as a result of the growth and margin improvement of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements in addition we have made changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years that have contributed to the increase in payments to partners pursuant to retailer share arrangements 

we believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners’ interests with ours we also believe that changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have contributed to the increase in our retailer share arrangement payments will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease and mitigate the impact on our profitability in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements 

retailer share arrangements increased by 35  million or 12  for the year ended   december 31 2017  driven primarily by the growth and margin improvement of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements largely offset by higher provision for loan losses associated with these programs 

retailer share arrangements increased by 164  million or 60  for the year ended   december 31 2016  driven primarily by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements partially offset by higher provision for loan losses and loyalty costs associated with these programs 

provision for loan losses 

provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at each period end date provision for loan losses in each period is a function of net chargeoffs gross chargeoffs net of recoveries and the required level of the allowance for loan losses our process to determine our allowance for loan losses is based upon our estimate of the incurred loss period for each type of loss ie aged fraud deceased settlement other nonaged and bankruptcy see “ critical accounting estimates  allowance for loan losses” and note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our allowance for loan loss methodology 

provision for loan losses increased by 1310 million  or 329  for the year ended   december 31 2017  primarily due to higher net chargeoffs and a higher loan loss reserve our allowance coverage ratio increased to 680  at december 31 2017  as compared to 569  at december 31 2016  reflecting the increase in forecasted losses inherent in our loan portfolio 

provision for loan losses increased by 1034 million  or 350  for the year ended   december 31 2016  primarily due to a higher loan loss reserve build and receivables growth the reserve build resulted from increases in our future expected losses in the next twelve months our allowance coverage ratio increased to 569  at december 31 2016  as compared to 512  at december 31 2015  reflecting the increase in forecasted losses inherent in our loan portfolio 

other income 



interchange revenue   

we earn interchange fees on dual card and other cobranded credit card transactions outside of our partners’ sales channels based on a flat fee plus a percent of the purchase amount growth in interchange revenue has been and is expected to continue to be driven primarily by growth in our dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card products 

interchange revenue increased by 51 million  or 85  for the year ended december 31 2017  and by 97 million or 192 for the year ended december 31 2016  driven by increases in purchase volume outside of our retail partners sales channels

debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance in return we will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events we offer our debt cancellation product to our credit card customers via online mobile and on a limited basis direct mail 

debt cancellation fees increased by 10 million  or 38  for the year ended december 31 2017  primarily as a result of higher average balances and increases in customer enrollment debt cancellation fees increased by 13 million or 52 for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily as a result of changes in marketing to our carecredit customers driving an increase in enrollment and billed balances 

loyalty programs 

we operate a number of loyalty programs primarily in our retail card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty these programs typically provide cardholders with statement credit or cash back rewards other programs include rewards points which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards or merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a preset spending level on their private label credit card dual card or general purpose cobranded credit card growth in loyalty program payments has been and is expected to continue to be driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs 

loyalty programs cost increased by 157 million  or 287  for the year ended december 31 2017  and by 128 million or 305 for the year ended december 31 2016 arising from the launch of new rewards programs with our partners and growth in purchase volume associated with existing loyalty programs the increase in 2017 also included the impact from higher reward redemption rates we experienced in one of our programs 

other 

other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees and realized gains or losses associated with investments and sales of assets 

other increased by 40 million  or 1481  for the year ended   december 31 2017  the increase included a pretax gain of 18 million associated with the sale of contractual relationships related to processing of general purpose card transactions for certain merchants in 2017 

other decreased by 30 million or 526 for the year ended december 31 2016 the decrease was primarily due to a pretax gain of 20 million associated with the sale of certain loan portfolios in 2015 

other expense 



employee costs 

employee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs 

employee costs increased by 107 million  or 89  for the year ended december 31 2017  and by 165 million or 158 for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to new employees added to support the continued growth of the business and replacement of certain thirdparty services 

professional fees   

professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees eg collection agencies and call centers legal accounting consulting and recruiting expenses 

professional fees decreased by 9 million  or 14  for the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to decreases in thirdparty expenses as we continued to move some processes inhouse partially offset by business growth 

professional fees decreased by 7 million  or 11  for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to a reduction in costs associated with the separation partially offset by business growth 

marketing and business development 

marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing and business development spend as well as amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions 

marketing and business development costs increased by 75 million  or 177  for the year ended december 31 2017  primarily due to strategic investments in our sales platforms card reissuances for some of our partner programs and increased marketing on retail deposits 

marketing and business development costs decreased by 10 million  or 23  for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily by redirecting marketing funds into our partners loyalty programs and reduced marketing on retail deposits 

information processing 

information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers credit card associations and software licensing agreements 

information processing costs increased by 35 million  or 104  for the year ended december 31 2017  and by 41 million or 138 for the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to higher information technology investment and higher transaction volume 

other 

other primarily consists of postage fraud expense litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other corporate overhead items such as facilities costs and telephone charges postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing option fraud or operational losses are driven primarily by the number of our active dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card accounts 

the “other” component increased by 123 million  or 152  for the year ended december 31 2017 primarily driven by higher operational losses and business growth 

the “other” component decreased by 37 million or 44 for the year ended december 31 2016 primarily driven by lower payments to ge due to the replacement of certain services that were previously provided to us under the transition services agreement with ge as well as benefits from the rollout of emv cards 

provision for income taxes 



we file consolidated us federal and state income tax returns separate and apart from ge for periods up to and including the date of separation we were included in the consolidated us federal and state income tax returns of ge where applicable but also filed certain separate state and foreign income tax returns the tax provision is presented on a separate company basis as if we were a separate filer for tax purposes for all periods presented the effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in our consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur our current obligations for taxes are settled with the relevant tax authority or ge as applicable on an estimated basis and adjusted in later periods as appropriate and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those settlements occur we recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws see “ critical accounting estimates—income taxes ” for a discussion of the significant judgments and estimates related to income taxes 

the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017  increased compared to the corresponding prior year period substantially all of this increase in 2017 was due to the impact of the tax act which resulted in 160 million of additional tax expense primarily due to a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased compared to the corresponding prior year period the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the discrete impact of a change in the effective state tax rate research and development credits and an additional tax benefit that is reimbursed to ge under the terms of the tssa in each year the effective tax rate excluding the impact of the tax act in 2017 differs from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 primarily due to state income taxes 

the tax act will affect our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future we expect the tax act to favorably affect our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2018 and future periods we expect our 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24 to 25 prior to the effects of any discrete items our effective tax rate for 2018 is decreasing as a result of the estimated impact of the tax act primarily due to the corporate tax rate reduction forthcoming guidance such as regulations or technical corrections could change how we interpret provisions of the tax act which may in turn impact our effective tax rate 

platform analysis 

as discussed above under “ —our sales platforms ” we offer our products through three sales platforms retail card payment solutions and carecredit which management measures based on their revenuegenerating activities the following is a discussion of certain supplemental information for the year ended   december 31 2017  for each of our sales platforms 

retail card 



retail card interest and fees on loans increased by 1125 million  or 103  for the year ended   december 31 2017  and by 1124 million or 115 for the year ended  december 31 2016 these increases were primarily the result of growth in average loan receivables 

retailer share arrangements increased by 34 million  or 12  for the year ended   december 31 2017  and by 182 million or 68 for the year ended  december 31 2016 primarily as a result of the factors discussed under the heading “ retailer share arrangements ” above 

other income decreased by 76 million  or 264  for the year ended   december 31 2017  and decreased by 51 million or 150 for the year ended  december 31 2016 the decreases were primarily a result of increase in loyalty program costs partially offset by increases in interchange revenue debt cancellation fees and other income 

payment solutions 



payment solutions interest and fees on loans increased by 229 million  or 117  for the year ended  december 31 2017 and by 233 million or 136 for the year ended december 31 2016 these increases were primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables

carecredit interest and fees on loans increased by 183 million  or 100  for the year ended   december 31 2017  and by 146 million or 87 for the year ended december 31 2016 these increases were primarily driven by increases in average loan receivables 

investment securities 

 

the following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our investment securities portfolio all of our investment securities are classified as availableforsale at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  and are held to meet our liquidity objectives and to comply with the community reinvestment act investment securities classified as availableforsale are reported in our consolidated statements of financial position at fair value 

the following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our portfolio of investment securities at the dates indicated 



unrealized gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities that are not otherthantemporarily impaired are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of comprehensive income loss until realized at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  our investment securities had gross unrealized gains of 1 million  3 million  and 2 million  respectively and gross unrealized losses of 32 million  31 million  and 17 million  respectively 

our investment securities portfolio had the following maturity distribution at december 31 2017  equity securities have been excluded from the table because they do not have a maturity 



 

 at december 31 2017  we did not hold investments in any single issuer with an aggregate book value that exceeded 10 of equity excluding obligations of the us government 

loan receivables 

 

the following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio 

loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenues the following table sets forth the composition of our loan receivables portfolio by product type at the dates indicated 



loan receivables increased by 5610 million  or 73  at december 31 2017  and by 8047 million or 118 at december 31 2016  primarily driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth 

our loan receivables portfolio had the following maturity distribution at december 31 2017  



 

 our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at december 31 2017  



impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings 

our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions principal forgiveness extensions or other actions which may cause the related loan to be classified as a tdr and also be impaired we use longterm modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve longterm collectability of the loans that are classified as tdrs the longterm program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan the longterm program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments we also make loan modifications for some customers who request financial assistance through external sources such as a consumer credit counseling agency program the loans that are modified typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal interest or fees the determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions meet the tdr criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances 

loans classified as tdrs are recorded at their present value with impairment measured as the difference between the loan balance and the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan our allowance for loan losses on tdrs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows 

interest income from loans accounted for as tdrs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans we accrue interest on credit card balances until the accounts are chargedoff in the period the accounts become 180 days past due the following table presents the amount of loan receivables that are not accruing interest loans that are 90 days or more pastdue and still accruing interest and earning tdrs for the periods presented 



 

 



delinquencies 

over30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of periodend loan receivables increased to 467  at december 31 2017  as compared to 432  at december 31 2016  and 406 at december 31 2015 the 35 basis point increase in 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year and the 26 basis point increase in 2016 compared to 2015 were driven by the factors discussed in business trends and conditions — asset quality  above 

net chargeoffs 

net chargeoffs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible net of recovered amounts we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and thirdparty fraud losses from chargeoffs chargedoff and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while thirdparty fraud losses are included in other expense chargeoffs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses and subsequent recoveries of previously chargedoff amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses costs incurred to recover chargedoff loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 

the table below sets forth the ratio of net chargeoffs to average loan receivables including held for sale for the periods indicated 



allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses totaled 5574 million  at december 31 2017  compared with 4344 million  at december 31 2016  representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables increased to 680  at december 31 2017  from 569  at december 31 2016  which reflects the increase in forecasted net chargeoffs over the next twelve months in both periods 

the following tables provide changes in our allowance for loan losses for the periods presented 











 

 

funding liquidity and capital resources 

 

we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital our funding liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations our business growth our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments 

funding sources 

our primary funding sources include cash from operations deposits direct and brokered deposits securitized financings and thirdparty debt 

the following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated 

 

 deposits 

we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers “direct deposits” or through thirdparty brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers “brokered deposits” at december 31 2017  we had 427 billion  in direct deposits and 138 billion  in deposits originated through brokerage firms including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to expand our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding 

our direct deposits include a range of fdicinsured deposit products including certificates of deposit iras money market accounts and savings accounts 

brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms we have relationships with 10  brokers that offer our deposits through their networks our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at december 31 2017  had a weighted average remaining life of 26  years these deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal 

our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to among other things the interest rates we pay and therefore we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates or interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits to mitigate these risks our funding strategy includes a range of deposit products and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources including securitized financings including our undrawn committed capacity and unsecured debt 

the following table summarizes certain information regarding our interestbearing deposits by type all of which constitute us deposits for the periods indicated 

our deposit liabilities provide funding with maturities ranging from one day to ten years at december 31 2017  the weighted average maturity of our interestbearing time deposits was 17  years 

the following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity at december 31 2017  



 

 securitized financings 

we have been engaged in the securitization of our credit card receivables since 1997 we access the assetbacked securitization market using the synchrony credit card master note trust “synct” through which we issue assetbacked securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits in addition we issue assetbacked securities in private transactions through the synchrony sales finance master trust “sft” and the synchrony card issuance trust “synit” which was formed during the fourth quarter of 2017 

at december 31 2017  we had 42 billion  of outstanding private assetbacked securities and 83 billion  of outstanding public assetbacked securities in each case held by unrelated third parties 

the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors’ interests in securitized financings excluding debt premiums discounts and issuance costs at december 31 2017  

 

 we retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through i in the case of synct sft and synit subordinated retained interests in the loan receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series that provides credit enhancement for a particular series as well as a pari passu seller’s interest in each trust and ii in the case of synct subordinated classes of notes that we own 

all of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers referred to as early amortization events including events related to material breaches of representations warranties or covenants inability or failure of the bank to transfer loan receivables to the trusts as required under the securitization documents failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents and certain insolvencyrelated events with respect to the related securitization depositor synchrony solely with respect to synct or the bank in addition an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series or for the trust as applicable falls below zero following an early amortization event principal collections on the loan receivables in the applicable trust are applied to repay principal of the trusts assetbacked securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business the occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred no early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in synct sft or synit 

the following table summarizes for each of our trusts the threemonth rolling average excess spread at december 31 2017  



 



thirdparty debt 

senior unsecured notes 

the following table provides a summary of our outstanding senior unsecured notes at december 31 2017  

 

 at december 31 2017  the aggregate amount of outstanding senior unsecured notes was 83 billion  and the weighted average interest rate was 350  

on january 2 2018 the bank issued a total of 500 million principal amount of threemonth libor plus 0625 senior unsecured notes due 2020 

shortterm borrowings 

except as described above there were no material shortterm borrowings for the periods presented 

other   

at december 31 2017  we had more than 250 billion  of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window 

covenants 

the indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants including covenants that restrict subject to certain exceptions synchrony’s ability to dispose of or incur liens on any of the voting stock of the bank or otherwise permit the bank to be merged consolidated leased or sold in a manner that results in the bank being less than 80  controlled by us 

if we do not satisfy any of these covenants discussed above the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december 31 2017  

at december 31 2017  we were not in default under any of our credit facilities 

credit ratings 

our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of the company the bank and the ratings of our assetbacked securities 

synchrony’s senior unsecured debt is rated bbb stable outlook by fitch and bbb stable outlook by sp the bank’s senior unsecured debt is rated bbb stable outlook by fitch and bbb stable outlook by sp in addition certain of the assetbacked securities issued by synct are rated by fitch sp andor moody’s a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

liquidity 

 

we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations fund asset growth satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions 

we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business which is the responsibility of our asset and liability management committee a subcommittee of our risk committee we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process we evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs 

we maintain a liquidity portfolio which at december 31 2017  had 151 billion  of liquid assets primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and shortterm obligations of the us treasury less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid compared to a 136 billion  of liquid assets at december 31 2016  the increase in liquid assets was primarily due to the retention of excess cash flows from operations within our company 

as additional sources of liquidity at december 31 2017  we had an aggregate of 55 billion  of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under our securitization programs and 05 billion  of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders and we had more than 250 billion  of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window 

as a general matter investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash the level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions 

we rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity however bank regulations contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the bank’s ability to pay dividends see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness ” and “ item 1a business—regulation—savings association regulation—dividends and stock repurchases ” 

capital 

 

our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our business meet regulatory requirements adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments within these constraints we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders 

synchrony and the bank are required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the occs and the federal reserve boards stress test regulations the bank and synchrony are required to use stresstesting methodologies providing for results under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress in addition while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the federal reserve boards capital planning rule we have submitted a capital plan to the federal reserve board in both 2016 and 2017 

dividend and share repurchases 



on may 18 2017 the board announced plans to increase the quarterly dividend to 015 per share commencing in the third quarter of 2017 the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the board and will depend on many factors for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock see “ risk factors—risks relating to regulation—we are subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends and repurchase its common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to synchrony which could limit synchronys ability to pay dividends repurchase its common stock or make payments on its indebtedness ” 



in may 2017 we completed our initial share repurchase program of up to 952 million on may 18 2017 the company approved a share repurchase program of up to 164 billion through june 30 2018 we made and expect to continue to make share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals 

regulatory capital requirements  synchrony financial 

as a savings and loan holding company we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios under the applicable us basel iii capital rules for more information see “ regulation—savings and loan holding company regulation ” 

for synchrony financial to be a wellcapitalized savings and loan holding company synchrony bank must be wellcapitalized and synchrony financial must not be subject to any written agreement order capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued by the federal reserve board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure as of december 31 2017 and 2016 synchrony financial met all the requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized 

the following table sets forth at december 31 2017  and 2016  the composition of our capital ratios for the company calculated under the basel iii regulatory capital standards respectively 



 

 the decrease in our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was primarily due to the capital deployment through our increased dividends and share repurchases in the year ended december 31 2017  

regulatory capital requirements  synchrony bank 

at december 31 2017  and 2016  the bank met all applicable requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized pursuant to occ regulations and for purposes of the federal deposit insurance act the following table sets forth the composition of the bank’s capital ratios calculated under the basel iii rules at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  



failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see “ risk factors—risks relating to regulation—failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us ” 

nongaap measures 

 

we present adjusted net earnings that represents net earnings adjusted to exclude additional tax expense incurred in the year ended december 31 2017 related to the effects from the tax act the additional tax expense was primarily due to the tax act’s reduction in the corporate tax rate that resulted in a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities we believe this measure helps investors understand the impact of this recent law change on our reported results the following table sets forth a reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to the comparable gaap component at december 31 2107 



 

 we also present certain capital ratios including cet1 as calculated under the us basel iii capital rules on a fully phasedin basis which was not required by our regulators to be disclosed for the balance sheet dates presented and as such is considered to be a nongaap measure we believe that this capital ratio is a useful measure to investors because it is widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies although this ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the components of our cet1 capital ratio as calculated on a fully phasedin basis set forth above to the comparable gaap components at december 31 2017  and 2016  





 



offbalance sheet arrangements and unfunded lending commitments 

 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantees of thirdparty obligations guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a thirdparty based on certain trigger events at december 31 2017  we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position related to any guarantees 

we extend credit primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards in the ordinary course of business see note 4 loan receivables and allowance for loan losses  to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments 

contractual obligations 

 

in the normal course of business we enter into various contractual obligations that require future cash payments our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations at december 31 2017 are summarized below 

 



critical accounting estimates 

 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties the critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for loan losses income taxes and fair value measurements all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables future impairments of investment securities goodwill and intangible assets and the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities among other effects see note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements which discusses the significant accounting policies related to these estimates 

allowance for loan losses 

losses on loan receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of probable losses takes into account our historical experience adjusted for current conditions with each product and customer type and our judgment concerning the probable effects of relevant observable data trends and market factors 

we evaluate each portfolio quarterly for credit card receivables our estimation process includes analysis of historical data and there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance our risk process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or on a portfolio basis as appropriate more specifically we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables we use other analyses to estimate losses incurred on nondelinquent accounts the considerations in these analyses include past performance risk management techniques applied to various accounts historical behavior of different account vintages current economic conditions recent trends in delinquencies bankruptcy filings account collection management policy changes account seasoning loan volume and amounts payment rates forecasting uncertainties and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for losses which compares this allowance for losses to projected net chargeoffs over the next 12 months in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance we do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis but instead estimate its allowance for credit card loan losses on a portfolio basis further experience is not available for new portfolios therefore while we are developing that experience we set loss allowances based on our experience with the most closely analogous products in our portfolio the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates 

income taxes 

we are subject to income tax in the united states federal state and local as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate our provision for income tax expense is based on our income the statutory tax rates and other provisions of the tax laws applicable to us in each of these various jurisdictions these laws are complex and their application to our facts is at times open to interpretation on december 22 2017 the tax act was signed into law and significantly revised the us income tax laws the 2017 income tax provision includes the discrete tax impact of the tax act the discrete impact of the tax act is based on management’s interpretation of the legislation and is subject to change based on future guidance and clarification the process of determining our consolidated income tax expense includes significant judgments and estimates including judgments regarding the interpretation of those laws our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities incorporate those judgments and estimates and reflect management’s best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities as well as the impact of tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks and are measured using the enacted income tax laws and rates that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are specific to the jurisdiction in which they arise and are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization of those assets is more likely than not in making decisions regarding our ability to realize tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income taxable income in carryback periods expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the implementation of available tax planning strategies these decisions rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and our short and longrange business forecasts to provide insight 

asc 740 income taxes  establishes the framework by which we determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to be maintained for uncertain income tax positions applying this framework we recognize the financial statement impact of uncertain income tax positions when we conclude that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits of a position that the position will be sustained upon examination in certain situations we establish a liability that represents the difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return and the amount of taxes recognized in our financial statements 

fair value measurements 

assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances primarily include acquired loans loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost method and equity method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired 

assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs a fair value measurement is determined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued 

new accounting standards 

 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the new revenue recognition guidance will become effective january 1 2018 for the company the scope of asu 201409 excludes interest and fee income on loans and as a result the majority of the companys revenue is not in scope of the standard the new guidance does not impact the timing or measurement of the companys revenues and as a result the company will not present any restated prior period results when the standard becomes effective 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842 the asu requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet leases which are identified as capital leases currently will generally be identified as financing leases under the new guidance but otherwise their accounting treatment will remain relatively unchanged leases identified as operating leases currently will generally remain in that category under the new standard but both a rightofuse asset and a liability for remaining lease payments will now be required to be recognized on the balance sheet this guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2019 management does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 financial instrumentscredit losses measurement of credit losses on financial instruments this asu replaces the existing incurred loss impairment guidance with a new impairment model known as the current expected credit loss cecl model which is based on expected credit losses the cecl model requires upon origination of a loan the recognition of all expected credit losses over the life of the loan based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts this standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 the amendments in this standard will be recognized through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective while we are evaluating the effect that asu 201613 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures this standard is expected to result in an increase to the company’s allowance for loan losses given the change to expected losses for the estimated life of the financial asset the extent of the increase will depend on the asset quality of the portfolio and economic conditions and forecasts at adoption 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash the asu requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginningofperiod and endofperiod total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows this guidance is required to be applied retrospectively and will become effective january 1 2018 for the company management does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

on december 22 2017 the securities exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act sab 118 provides for a measurement period that may not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the required accounting under asc 740 in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect as of the end of the accounting period that includes the date of enactment of the tax act only those income tax effects of the tax act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete to the extent that the company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act is incomplete but the company is able to determine a reasonable estimate the company must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if the company cannot determine a provisional estimate it must continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax law that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the tax act at december 31 2017 our accounting for the tax act is complete under sab 118 forthcoming guidance such as regulations or technical corrections could change how we interpreted provisions of the tax act 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates see “ item 1a risk factors—risks relating to our business—changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings funding and liquidity ” and “ —a reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets ” 

interest rate risk   

we borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease as some of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is generally the prime rate and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either libor or the federal funds rate the prime rate and the libor or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities 

competitive factors and future regulatory reform may limit or restrict our ability to raise interest rates on our loans in addition some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers if interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner our net interest income and margin could be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us our floating rate products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowances for loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity 

at december 31 2017  564  of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer with the remaining 436  at a floating interest rate we fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits assetbacked securities and unsecured debt to manage interest rate risk we seek to match the interest rate repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities historically we have not used interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk however we may choose to do so in the future to the extent we are unable to effectively match the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities our net earnings could be materially adversely affected 

we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our net interest income 

for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates over the 12month period from our reporting date we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period the sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously simultaneously and to the same degree 

our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity portfolio at december 31 2017  436  of our receivables were priced at a floating interest rate assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature or otherwise contractually reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12month period are considered to be rate sensitive the latter category includes certain loans that may be offered at belowmarket rates for an introductory period such as balance transfers and special promotional programs after which the loans will contractually reprice under standard terms in accordance with our normal marketbased pricing structure for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice ie assets are categorized as fixed or floating according to their underlying contractual terms for assets that have a fixed interest rate at the period end but which contractually will or are assumed to reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 

interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12month period thus liabilities that vary with changes in a marketbased index such as the federal funds rate or libor which will reset before the end of the 12month period or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a marketbased indexed rate prior to the end of the 12month period also are considered to be rate sensitive for these fixed rate liabilities net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 

assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december 31 2017  we estimate that net interest income over the following 12month period would increase by approximately 103 million  this estimate projects net interest income over the following 12month period and takes into consideration future growth and balance sheet composition 

limitations of market risk measures   

the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information internallydeveloped assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments other market inputs such as interest rates market prices and interest rate volatility are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures we regularly evaluate update and enhance these assumptions models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities 

there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates the sensitivity analysis provided above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is based on the existing balance sheet as well as assumptions around future growth pricing and balance sheet composition it does not attempt to estimate the effect of a more significant interest rate increase over a sustained period of time which as described in “ —interest rate risk ” above could adversely affect our net interest income in addition the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ from our projections which could cause our actual net interest income to differ from the above sensitivity analysis

report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting 

 

the management of synchrony financial “the company” is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company as defined by exchange act rules 13a15 and 15d15 the companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the companys assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the companys receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate although any system of internal control can be compromised by human error or intentional circumvention of required procedures we believe our system provides reasonable assurance that financial transactions are recorded and reported properly providing an adequate basis for reliable financial statements

retail card program agreements 

our retail card programs are governed by program agreements that are each negotiated separately with our partners although the terms of the agreements are partnerspecific and may be amended from time to time under a typical program agreement our partner agrees to support and promote the program to its customers but we control credit criteria and issue credit cards to customers who qualify under those criteria we own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination other key provisions in the retail card program agreements include 

term 

retail card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years many program agreements have renewal clauses that provide for automatic renewal for one or more years until terminated by us or our partner we typically seek to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates 

exclusivity 

the program agreements typically are exclusive for the products we offer and limit our partners’ ability to originate or promote other private label or cobranded credit cards during the term of the agreement 

retailer share arrangements 

most of our retail card program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractuallydefined threshold economic performance for the purposes of these arrangements is typically measured based on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses we may also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements for example on our cobranded credit cards all of these arrangements align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products 

other economic terms 

in addition to the retailer share arrangements the program agreements typically provide that the parties will develop a marketing plan to support the program and they set the terms by which a joint marketing budget is funded the basic terms of the rewards program linked to the use of our product such as opportunities to receive double rewards points for purchases made on a retail card product and the allocation of costs related to the rewards program

payment solutions program agreements 

national and regional retailers and manufacturers

individuallybranded programs 

our individuallybranded programs are focused on specific industries where we create either companybranded or company and partnerbranded private label credit cards that are usable across all participating locations within the industryspecific network for example our synchrony car care program comprised of merchants selling automotive parts repair services and tires covers over 27000  locations across the united states and cards issued may be dual branded with synchrony car care and partners such as midas michelin tires or pep boys under the terms of these programs we establish merchant discounts applicable to each financing offer and in some cases the fees we charge partners for their membership in the network 

dealer agreements 

for the programs we have established with manufacturers buying groups industry associations and individuallybranded programs described above we enter into individual agreements with the merchants and dealers that offer our credit products under these programs these agreements generally are not exclusive and some parties who offer our financing products also offer financing from our competitors our agreements generally continue until terminated by either party with termination typically available to either party at will upon 15 days’ written notice our dealer agreements set forth the economic terms associated with the program including the fees charged to dealers to offer promotional financing and in some cases allow us to periodically change the fees we charge

we enter into provider agreements with individual healthcare providers who become part of our carecredit network these provider agreements are similar to the dealer agreements that govern our relationships with the merchants and dealers offering our payment solutions products in that the agreements are not exclusive and typically may be terminated at will upon 15 days’ notice multiyear agreements are in place for larger multilocation relationships across all markets there are typically no retailer share arrangements with partners in carecredit 

at december 31 2016  we had relationships with over 100  professional and other associations including the american dental association and the american animal hospital association manufacturers and buying groups which endorse and promote our credit products to their members of these relationships over 60  were paid endorsements linked to member enrollment in and volume under the relevant program 

we screen potential partners using a variety of criteria including whether the potential provider specializes in one of our approved specialties carries the appropriate licensing and certifications and meets our underwriting criteria we also screen potential partners for reputational issues we work with professional and other associations manufacturers buying groups industry associations and healthcare consultants to educate their constituents about the products and services we offer we believe our ability to attract new partners is aided by our customer satisfaction rate which our research in 2016  showed is 91  we also approach individual healthcare service providers through direct mail and advertising and at trade shows 

during the year ended december 31 2016  we renewed vca animal hospitals in our network of providers and renewed our carecredit endorsement relationships with the american dental association and american society of plastic surgeons

our credit products

the following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer at december 31 2016  



credit cards 

our credit card products are loans we extend through openended revolving credit card accounts we offer the following principal types of credit cards 

private label credit cards 

private label credit cards are partnerbranded credit cards eg lowe’s or amazon or programbranded credit cards eg synchrony car care or carecredit that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network in addition in some cases cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances 

credit under a private label credit card typically is extended either on standard terms only in our retail card sales platform which means accounts are assessed periodic interest charges using an agreed nonpromotional fixed andor variable interest rate or pursuant to a promotional financing offer in our payment solutions and carecredit sales platforms involving deferred interest no interest or reduced interest during a set promotional period promotional periods typically range between six and 48 months but we may agree to longer terms with the partner in almost all cases we receive a merchant discount from our partners to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing the terms of these promotions vary by partner but generally the longer the deferred interest reduced interest or interestfree period the greater the partner’s merchant discount some offers permit customers to pay for a purchase in equal monthly payments with no interest or at a reduced interest rate rather than deferring or delaying interest charges for our deferred interest products approximately 75  to 80  of customer transactions are typically paid off before interest is assessed in carecredit standard rate financing generally applies to charges under 200 

we typically do not charge interchange or other fees to our partners when a customer uses a private label credit card to purchase our partners’ goods and services through our payment system 

most of our private label credit card business is in the united states for some of our partners who have locations in canada we also support the issuance and acceptance of private label credit cards at their locations in canada and from customers in canada 

dual cards   and general purpose cobrand cards 

our patented dual cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to make purchases of goods or services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used to make purchases from other retailers wherever cards from those card networks are accepted or for cash advance transactions we currently issue dual cards for use on the mastercard and visa networks and we currently have the ability to issue dual cards for use on the american express and discover networks 

we have been granted two us patents relating to the process by which our dual cards function as a private label credit card when used to make purchases from our partners and function as a general purpose credit card when used on the systems of other credit card associations 

we also offer general purpose cobranded credit cards that do not also function as private label credit cards 

credit extended under our dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only currently only retail card offers dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards at december 31 2016  we offered dual card or general purpose cobranded credit cards through 18  of our 26  ongoing retail card programs of which the majority are dual cards we expect to continue to increase the number of partner programs that offer dual cards or general purpose cobranded credit cards and seek to increase the portion of our loan receivables attributable to these products 

charges using a dual card or general purpose cobranded credit card generate interchange income for us in connection with purchases made by cardholders other than instore or online from that partner 

we currently do not issue dual cards or general purpose cobranded credit cards in canada 

terms and conditions 

as a general matter the financial terms and conditions governing our credit card products vary by program and product type and change over time although we seek to standardize the nonfinancial provisions consistently across all products the terms and conditions of our credit card products are governed by a cardholder agreement and applicable laws and regulations 

we assign each card account a credit limit when the account is initially opened thereafter we may increase or decrease individual credit limits from time to time at our discretion based primarily on our evaluation of the customer’s creditworthiness and ability to pay 

for the vast majority of accounts periodic interest charges are calculated using the daily balance method which results in daily compounding of periodic interest charges subject to at times a grace period on new purchases cash advances are not subject to a grace period and some credit card programs do not provide a grace period for promotional purchases in addition to periodic interest charges we may impose other charges and fees on credit card accounts including as applicable and provided in the cardholder agreement cash advance transaction fees and late fees where a customer has not paid at least the minimum payment due by the required due date 

typically each customer with an outstanding debit balance on his or her credit card account must make a minimum payment each month a customer may pay the total amount due at any time without penalty we also may enter into arrangements with delinquent customers to extend or otherwise change payment schedules and to waive interest charges andor fees

we have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities our online platform is highly scalable allowing us to expand without having to rely on a traditional “brick and mortar” branch network we expect the continued growth in our direct banking platform to come primarily from retail deposits 

we are growing our direct banking operations and believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the consumerdriven shift from branch banking to direct banking according to the 2016 american bankers association survey the percentage of customers who prefer to do their banking via direct channels internet mail phone and mobile was 80  while those who prefer branch banking was only 14

credit risk management 

 

credit risk management is a critical component of our management and growth strategy credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from customer default when customers are unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to us our credit risk arising from credit products is generally highly diversified across over 125 million  open accounts at december 31 2016  without significant individual exposures we manage credit risk primarily according to customer segments and product types 

customer account acquisition 

we have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and have developed varying credit decision guidelines for the different partners we originate credit accounts through several different channels including instore mail internet mobile telephone and preapproved solicitations in addition we have and may in the future acquire accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners 

regardless of the channel in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit we follow a series of credit risk and underwriting procedures in most cases when applications are made instore or by internet or mobile the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately we generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus the credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to calculate a credit score the risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio and product type we periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance and adjust the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage risk different scoring models may be used depending upon bureau type and account source 

we also apply additional application screens based on various inputs including credit bureau information to help identify potential fraud and prior bankruptcies before qualifying the application for approval we compare applicants’ names against the specially designated nationals list maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury “ofac” as well as screens that account for adherence to usa patriot act of 2001 the “patriot act” and credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 the “card act” requirements including ability to pay requirements 

we also use preapproved account solicitations for certain programs potential applicants are prescreened using information provided by our partner or obtained from outside lists and qualified individuals receive a preapproved credit offer by mail or email 

acquired portfolio evaluation 

our risk management team evaluates each portfolio that we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our credit risk guidelines as part of this review we receive data on the thirdparty accounts and loans which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information in addition we benchmark potential portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks finally our risk management team must approve the acquisition taking into account the results of our risk assessment process once assets are migrated to our systems our account management protocols will apply immediately as described below under “ —customer account management ” “ —credit authorizations of individual transactions ” and “ —collections ” 

customer account management 

we regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts this ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customer’s performance with respect to its account with us as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer’s broader credit performance to monitor and control the quality of our loan portfolio including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active account on its monthly cycle date proprietary risk models together with the fico scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly are an integral part of our credit decisionmaking process depending on the duration of the customer’s account risk profile and other performance metrics the account may be subject to a range of account actions including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits 

credit authorizations of individual transactions 

once an account has been opened when a credit card is used to make a purchase instore at one of our partners’ locations or online pointofsale terminals or online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system which allows for realtime updating of accounts each potential sales transaction is passed through a transaction authorization system which takes into account a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved or declined and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted 

fraud investigation 

we provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings new account fraud and transactional fraud we have developed a proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customer’s established pattern our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers we also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud such as utilizing embedded security chips emv for our active dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card products with all of our retail partners 

collections 

all monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts collections personnel generally initiate contact with customers within 30 days after any portion of their balance becomes past due the nature and the timing of the initial contact typically a personal call email text message or letter are determined by a review of the customer’s prior account activity and payment habits 

we reevaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques including internal collection activities use of external vendors and the sale of debt to thirdparty buyers as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent we limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the transaction authorization processes the imposition of credit limits and criteriabased account suspension and revocation processes in certain situations we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules decrease interest rates andor waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us 

customer service

technology and data security 

 

products and services 

we leverage information technology and deliver products and services that meet the needs of our partners and enable us to operate our business efficiently the integration of our technology with our partners is at the core of our value proposition enabling among other things customers to “apply and buy” at the point of sale and many of our partners to settle transactions directly with us without an interchange fee a key part of our strategic focus is the continued development of innovative efficient flexible technology and operational platforms to support marketing risk management account acquisition and account management customer service and new product development we believe that the continued investment in and development of these platforms is an important part of our efforts to increase our competitive capabilities reduce costs improve quality and provide faster more flexible technology services therefore we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems processes and competencies to meet our business needs 

as part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technologies we may either develop these capabilities internally or in partnership with thirdparty providers we rely on thirdparty providers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and in some cases architecture designed by us these relationships include first data for our credit card transaction processing and production and fiserv for retail banking 

data security 

the protection and security of financial and personal information of our consumers is one of our highest priorities we have implemented a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards and provides an appropriate level of protection to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our companys and our customers information this includes protecting against any known or evolving threats to the security or integrity of customer records and information and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information 

our information security program is intelligenceled focused on continuously adapting to an evolving landscape of emerging threats and available technology through data gathering and evaluation of emerging threats from internal and external incidents and technology investment security controls are adjusted on a continuous basis we work directly with our partners on an ongoing basis to expand our intelligence ecosystem and facilitate awareness and communications of events outside of the company 

we have developed a security strategy and implemented multiple layers of controls embedded throughout our technology environment that establish multiple control points between threats and our assets our security program is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store process or have access to sensitive data and we require the same level of protection from such thirdparty service providers we evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls through ongoing assessment and measurement 

in addition we identify risks that may threaten customer information and perform a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms systems and applications used to provide our products and services we employ backup and disaster recovery procedures for all the systems that are used for storing processing and transferring customer information and we periodically test and validate our disaster recovery plans we are compliant with the payment card industry pci program 

in connection with the separation we have completed the migration of the majority of the transitional services relating to technology and business processes provided by ge the exit of these remaining services includes the migration of very limited portions of our technology operating environment as a standalone company our corporate infrastructure is more focused and simplified creating greater security and resiliency for our clients partners and customers 

competition 

 

our industry is highly competitive and is becoming more competitive we compete for relationships with partners in connection with retaining existing or establishing new consumer credit programs our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as alliance data systems american express capital one jpmorgan chase citibank td bank and wells fargo and to a lesser extent potential partners’ own inhouse financing capabilities we compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors including program financial and other terms underwriting standards marketing expertise service levels product and service offerings including incentive and loyalty programs technological capabilities and integration brand and reputation in addition some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting eg new account approval customer service and collections and other core banking responsibilities that we retain 

we also compete for customer usage of our credit products consumer credit provided and credit card payments made using our cards constitute only a small percentage of overall consumer credit provided and credit card payments in the united states consumers have numerous financing and payment options available to them as a form of payment our products compete with cash checks debit cards visa and mastercard credit cards as well as american express discover card other privatelabel card brands and to a certain extent prepaid cards we also compete with nontraditional providers such as paypal in the future we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies such as apple pay chase pay samsung pay and square to the extent that our products are not accepted in or compatible with such technologies we may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry we compete for customers and their usage of our deposit products and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances based on a number of factors including pricing interest rates and fees product offerings credit limits incentives including loyalty programs and customer service some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services including home and automobile loans debit cards and bank branch atm access which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs in addition some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are may have substantially greater resources than we do or may offer a broader range of products and services than we do moreover some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage 

in our retail deposits business we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other directbanking competitors we compete for deposits with traditional banks and in seeking to grow our directbanking business we compete with other banks that have directbanking models similar to ours such as ally financial american express capital one 360 ing discover goldman sachs nationwide sallie mae and united services automobile association “usaa competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to quickly and easily deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors 

intellectual property 

 

we use a variety of methods such as trademarks patents copyrights and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property including our brand synchrony we also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures our brands are important assets and we take steps to protect the value of these assets and our reputation 

employees

the bank is a federally chartered savings association as such the bank is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ which is its primary regulator and by the cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the united states as discussed further throughout this section certain aspects of the doddfrank act are subject to further rulemaking that are taking effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us or across the industry see also “ item 1a  risk factors—risks relating to regulation—the doddfrank act has had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations ” 

savings and loan holding company regulation 

overview 

as a savings and loan holding company we are required to register and file periodic reports with and are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board the federal reserve board has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as liquidity risk management securitizations operational risk management internal controls and audit systems business continuity and compensation and other employee benefits we are regularly reviewed and examined by the federal reserve board which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require our response and attention 

the federal reserve board has broad enforcement authority over us and our subsidiaries other than the bank and the its subsidiaries under the doddfrank act we are required to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution that we control such as the bank 

capital 

as a standalone savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to capital requirements 

the following are the minimum capital ratios to which synchrony is subject 

 for a discussion of our capital ratios see “ item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—capital ” 

as of january 1 2017 we will also be required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the federal reserve board’s stress test regulations we are required to utilize stresstesting methodologies providing for results under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress prior to january 1 2017 we were already complying with the stress test requirement in substantial part and sharing results with the federal reserve board in addition although as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” rule the federal reserve board may in the future require us to comply with the ccar process or some modified version of the ccar process under this process the federal reserve board would measure our regulatory capital levels under various stress scenarios further while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the federal reserve board’s capital planning rule we prepare and submit a form of capital plan to the federal reserve board for its review 

liquidity 

as a savings and loan holding company with total consolidated assets in excess of 50 billion we are required to comply with the modified liquidity coverage ratio rule “modified lcr rule” approved by the federal reserve board in 2014 the modified lcr rule requires us to calculate on a monthly basis the ratio of the amount of our high quality liquid assets to our expected total net cash outflows over a 30day stress period “modified lcr ratio” and to maintain a modified lcr ratio above 10 under a rule adopted by the federal reserve board in december 2016 we will be required to disclose our modified lcr ratio and other associated liquidity data on a quarterly basis commencing with the fourth quarter of 2018 

in addition to the modified lcr rule we may in the future be required to comply with rules adopted by the federal reserve board to implement the basel iii net stable funding ratio “nsfr” in the united states which would require us to maintain a minimum acceptable amount of stable funding based on our liquidity characteristics over a oneyear period in june 2016 the federal reserve board proposed a rule to implement the nsfr in the united states under the proposed rule which would be effective january 1 2018 we would be subject to a modified nsfr which would be calibrated at 70 percent of the amount of stable funding that would be required of depository institution holding companies with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or 10 billion or more in total onbalance sheet foreign exposure 

finally the federal reserve board requires bank holding companies of a similar size to us to comply with certain enhanced prudential standards with respect to liquidity management among other things such bank holding companies must maintain diversified liquidity buffers and must regularly conduct liquidity stress tests while as a savings and loan holding company we are not subject to the same enhanced prudential standards that apply to comparable size bank holding companies we currently comply with many aspects of the liquidity management requirements in those enhanced prudential standards including the diversified buffer and stress testing requirements 

dividends and stock repurchases 

we are limited in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock by the federal reserve board including on the basis that doing so would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice where we intend to declare or pay a dividend we generally will be required to inform and consult with the federal reserve board in advance to ensure that such dividend does not raise supervisory concerns it is the policy of the federal reserve board that a savings and loan holding company like us should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition 

according to guidance from the federal reserve board our dividend policies will be assessed against among other things our ability to achieve applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements if we do not achieve applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements we may not be able to pay dividends although we currently expect to meet applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements inclusive of the capital conservation buffer when it is fully phased in by the federal reserve board we cannot be sure that we will meet those requirements or that even if we do if we will be able to pay dividends 

in evaluating the appropriateness of a proposed redemption or repurchase of stock the federal reserve board will consider among other things the potential loss that we may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets as a result of continued asset deterioration and our ability to raise additional common equity and other capital to replace the stock that will be redeemed or repurchased the federal reserve board also will consider the potential negative effects on our capital structure of replacing common stock with any lowertier form of regulatory capital issued moreover the approval process for any capital plan we are required to submit could result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions see “ item 1a   risk factorsrisks relating to regulationfailure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us ” and “ —we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness ” 

activities 

in general savings and loan holding companies may only conduct or acquire control of companies engaged in financial activities as permitted under the relevant provisions of the bank holding company act and the home owners loan act hola as a savings and loan holding company our activities are subject to such limitations 

in addition we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit in certain respects the types of acquisitions and investments that we can make for example certain acquisitions of and investments in depository institutions or their holding companies that we may undertake are subject to the prior review and approval of our banking regulators including the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic our banking regulators have broad discretion on whether to approve such acquisitions and investments in deciding whether to approve a proposed 

acquisition or investment federal bank regulators may consider among other factors i the effect of the acquisition or investment on competition ii our financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels iii the competence experience and integrity of our management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations iv the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the our record of compliance under the community reinvestment act the “cra” v our effectiveness in combating money laundering and vi any risks that the proposed acquisition poses to the us banking or financial system 

certain acquisitions of our voting stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal law investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not directly or indirectly acquire shares of our stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval under the change in bank control act and the hola which prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us without in most cases the prior written approval of the federal reserve board

savings associations including the bank are subject as well to limitations on their lending and investments these limitations include percentage of asset limitations on various types of loans the bank may make in addition there are similar limitations on the types and amounts of investments the bank may make 

insured depository institutions including the bank are subject to restrictions under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act as implemented by federal reserve board regulation w which govern transactions between an insured depository institution and an affiliate including an entity that is the institution’s direct or indirect holding company and a nonbank subsidiary of such a holding company restrictions in sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act apply to “covered transactions” such as extensions of credit issuances of guarantees or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit made by the insured depository institution to an affiliate must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and that the aggregate amount of covered transactions is limited as to any one affiliate of the bank to 10 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to all of the bank’s affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus in addition transactions between the bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered by the bank to nonaffiliated companies ie at arm’s length 

the cra is a federal law that generally requires an insured depository institution to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments offer products and provide services in each case designed to meet the credit needs of these communities the cra also requires an institution to maintain comprehensive records of cra activities to demonstrate how it is meeting the credit needs of communities these records are subject to periodic examination by the responsible federal banking agency of the institution based on these examinations the agency rates the institution’s compliance with cra as “outstanding” “satisfactory” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance” the cra requires the agency to take into account the record of an institution in meeting the credit needs of the entire communities served including low and moderate income neighborhoods in determining such rating failure of an institution to receive at least a “satisfactory” rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities including acquisitions the bank received a cra rating of “outstanding” as of its most recent cra examination 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates there are no such restrictions under the fdia on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” further “undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations at december 31 2016  the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized for purposes of the fdia an inability to accept brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity 

deposit insurance 

the fdia requires the bank to pay deposit insurance assessments deposit insurance assessments are affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the federal deposit insurance fund the “dif” the doddfrank act increased the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the dif to 135  and removed the statutory cap on the reserve ratio the fdic subsequently set a reserve ratio of 2  and may increase that ratio in the future under the fdic’s current deposit insurance assessment methodology the bank is required to pay deposit insurance assessments based on its average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity and various other regulatory factors included in an fdic assessment scorecard 

in march 2016 the board of directors of the fdic approved a final rule to increase the dif reserve ratio to the statutorily required minimum level of 135 percent under a rule adopted by the fdic in 2011 regular assessment rates for all banks decrease after the reserve ratio first reaches 115 percent under the final rule adopted in march 2016 banks with at least 10 billion in assets are subject to a surcharge of 45 cents per 100 of the assessment base after making certain adjustments also after the reserve ratio reaches 115 percent the fdic expects the reserve ratio will likely reach 135 percent after approximately two years of payments of these surcharges the decrease in regular assessment rates and the surcharge for banks with 10 billion in assets both became effective beginning the third quarter of 2016 which is the first quarter after the reserve ratio reached 115 percent 

the fdia creates a depositor preference regime for the resolution of all insured depository institutions including the bank if any such institution is placed into receivership the fdic will pay out of the remaining net assets of the failed institution and only to the extent of such assets first secured creditors to the extent of their security second the administrative expenses of the receivership third all deposits liabilities both insured and uninsured fourth any other general or senior liabilities fifth any obligations subordinated to depositors or general creditors and finally any remaining net assets to shareholders in that capacity 

resolution and recovery planning 

the bank is required annually to submit to the fdic a plan for the bank’s resolution in the event of its failure the plan is designed to enable the fdic if appointed receiver for the bank to resolve the bank under sections 11 and 13 of the fdia in a manner that ensures that its depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the banks failure two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than friday maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of the bank’s assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution the resolution plan requirement is intended to ensure that the fdic has access to all of the material information it needs to resolve the bank efficiently in the event of its failure 

in september 2016 the occ issued final guidance that will require the bank to develop and maintain a recovery plan that identifies triggers and options for responding to a wide range of severe internal and external stress scenarios and for restoring the bank to the extent it is experiencing or is likely to experience considerable financial or operational stress to financial strength and viability in a timely manner the bank will be required to have in place its recovery plan under this guidance by july 1 2018 

heightened standards for risk management governance 

the occ’s heightened standards establish guidelines for the governance and risk management practices of large occregulated institutions including the bank these heightened standards require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risktaking activities provide standards for covered banks’ boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework and describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units independent risk management and internal audit functions the bank believes it complies with the heightened standards

the card act was enacted in 2009 and most of the requirements became effective in 2010 the card act made numerous amendments to the truth in lending act requiring us to make significant changes to many of our business practices including marketing underwriting pricing and billing the card act’s restrictions on our ability to increase interest rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and credit risk ultimately limits our ability to extend credit to new customers and provide additional credit to current customers other card act restrictions such as limitations on late fees have resulted and will continue to result in reduced interest income and loan fee income 

the fcra regulates our use of credit reports and the reporting of information to credit reporting agencies and also provides a standard for lenders to share information with affiliates and certain third parties and to provide firm offers of credit to consumers the fcra also places further restrictions on the use of information shared between affiliates for marketing purposes requires the provision of disclosures to consumers when riskbased pricing is used in a credit decision and requires safeguards to help protect consumers from identity theft

the durbin amendment in the doddfrank act requires the federal reserve board to promulgate certain rules related to debit transaction interchange fees the federal reserve board has adopted a final rule that among other things establishes a regulatory cap for many types of debit interchange transactions that is no more than 21 cents plus five basis points of the value of the transaction the federal reserve board’s rule also allows a debit card issuer to recover 1  per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraudrelated requirements in addition the rule prohibits the imposition of restrictions on a merchant’s ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over a network for which the issuer has enabled processing 

the doddfrank act established the cfpb which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair transparent and competitive the cfpb has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the doddfrank act and other federal consumer financial services laws as well as broad supervisory examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services such as us in addition the cfpb has an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the products we offer the system could inform future agency decisions with respect to regulatory enforcement or examination focus there continues to be uncertainty as to how the cfpb’s strategies and priorities will impact our business and our results of operations going forward see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureau’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business ” 

in march 2015 the cfpb issued a report scrutinizing predispute arbitration clauses and in may 2016 the cfpb published a proposed rule that would substantially curtail our ability to enter into voluntary predispute arbitration clauses with consumers the proposed rule would prevent us from including arbitration clauses in consumer contracts unless the clauses expressly permit class actions to proceed in court and require us to provide copies of consumer arbitration agreements claims and decisions to the cfpb for potential publication if the cfpb’s proposals are adopted we expect that our exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to our business—litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses ” 

privacy 

we are subject to various privacy information security and data protection laws including requirements concerning security breach notification for example in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the glba and implementing regulations and guidance among other things the glba i imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties ii requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties with certain exceptions and iii requires financial institutions to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches federal and state laws also require us to respond appropriately to data security breaches we have a program to comply with applicable privacy information security and data protection requirements imposed by federal state and foreign laws including the glba see also “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—regulations relating to privacy information security and data protection could increase our costs affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities ” 

money laundering and terrorist financing prevention program 

we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act and the usa patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale these controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments the program is coordinated by a compliance officer undergoes an annual independent audit to assess its effectiveness and requires training of employees 

in may 2016 the financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” promulgated a final rule under the bank secrecy act that requires the bank to adopt due diligence procedures to identify and verify a legal entity customer’s beneficial owners at the time a new account is opened and to understand the nature and purpose of the customer relationship the bank will be required to comply with the final rule by may 11 2018 and is currently working on changes to its product and channel strategies application and servicing processes and systems to ensure compliance see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—failure to comply with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us ” 

sanctions programs 

we have a program designed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs including those administered and enforced by ofac these sanctions are usually targeted against foreign countries terrorists international narcotics traffickers and those believed to be involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction these regulations generally require either the blocking of accounts or other property of specified entities or individuals but they may also require the rejection of certain transactions involving specified entities or individuals we maintain policies procedures and other internal controls designed to comply with these sanctions programs 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in “ cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements ” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” mda and the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes in “ item 8 financial statements and supplementary data ” of this form 10k report 

our business routinely encounters and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we anticipate discussion about important operational risks that our business encounters can be found in the business descriptions in “ item 1 business ” and the mda section of this form 10k report below we describe certain important strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will affect our future results 

risks relating to our business 

 

macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

key macroeconomic conditions historically have affected our business results of operations and financial condition and are likely to affect them in the future consumer confidence unemployment and housing indicators are among the factors that often impact consumer spending behavior poor economic conditions reduce the usage of our credit cards and other financing products and the average purchase amount of transactions on our credit cards and through our other products which in each case reduces our interest and fee income we rely primarily on interest and fees on our loan receivables to generate our net earnings our interest and fees on our loan receivables was 147 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  poor economic conditions also adversely affect the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us increasing delinquencies bankruptcies chargeoffs and allowances for loan losses and decreasing recoveries for example our over30 day delinquency rate as a percentage of periodend loan receivables was 825  at december 31 2009 during the financial crisis compared to 432  at december 31 2016  and our fullyear net chargeoff rate was 1126  for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 457  for the year ended december 31 2016  the assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix account maturation as well as broader consumer trends such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness during 2016 these factors contributed to increases in our delinquent accounts and our forecasted net chargeoff rate over the next twelve months we believe the delinquency rate and net chargeoff rate in our portfolio will continue to increase modestly from the low credit trends we have experienced in the last two years and are likely to increase materially if economic conditions deteriorate 

economic growth in the united states since the recession has been slow and uneven as consumers continue to recover from previously high unemployment rates lower housing values concerns about the level of us government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address this as well as economic and political conditions in the us and global markets a prolonged period of slow economic growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions would likely affect consumer spending levels and the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

macroeconomic conditions may also cause net earnings to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of securities analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding the impact of these conditions on our business and this may adversely impact our stock price 

our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners 

substantially all of our revenue is generated from the credit products we provide to customers of our partners pursuant to program agreements we enter into with our partners as a result our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners historically there has been turnover in our partners and we expect this will continue in the future for example during the year ended december 31 2015 we sold certain credit card portfolios associated with retail partners whose program agreements with us were not extended beyond their contractual expiration dates 

program agreements with our retail card partners and national and regional retailer and manufacturer payment solutions partners typically are for multiyear terms these program agreements generally permit our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons including in some cases if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria we fail to achieve certain targets with respect to approvals of new customers as a result of the credit criteria we use we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds or we are not adequately capitalized or certain force majeure events or changes in our ownership occur or a material adverse change in our financial condition occurs a few payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer and manufacturer partners also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us eg several months in addition programs with manufacturers buying groups and industry associations generally are made available to payment solutions partners such as individual retail outlets dealers and merchants under dealer agreements which typically may be terminated at will by the partner on short notice to us eg 15 days 

there is significant competition for our existing partners and our failure to retain our existing larger partner relationships upon the expiration or our earlier loss of a relationship upon the exercise of a partner’s early termination rights or the expiration or termination of a substantial number of smaller partner relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including growth rates and financial condition to the extent we do not acquire new partners of similar size and profitability or otherwise grow our business the competition for new partners is also significant and our failure to attract new partners could adversely affect our ability to grow 

a significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our five largest programs gap jcpenney lowe’s sam’s club and walmart accounted in aggregate for 54  of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended december 31 2016  and 50  of loan receivables at december 31 2016  our programs with jcpenney lowes and walmart each accounted for more than 10 of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended december 31 2016 sam’s club is a subsidiary of walmart that is a separate contracting entity with its own program agreement with us which we report separately from the walmart program we expect to have significant concentration in our largest relationships for the foreseeable future see  item 1 business—retail card partners  

the program agreements generally permit us or our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date under various circumstances as described in the preceding risk factor some of our program agreements also provide that upon expiration or termination our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loans generated with respect to its program and all related customer data the loss of any of our largest partners or a material reduction in the interest and fees we receive from their customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results depend to a significant extent on the active and effective promotion and support of our products by our partners 

our partners generally accept most major credit cards and various other forms of payment and therefore our success depends on their active and effective promotion of our products to their customers we depend on our partners to integrate the use of our credit products into their store culture by training their sales associates about our products having their sales associates encourage their customers to apply for and use our products and otherwise effectively marketing our products in addition although our retail card programs and our payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer partners typically are exclusive with respect to the credit products we offer at that partner some payment solutions programs and most carecredit provider relationships are not exclusive to us and therefore a partner may choose to promote a competitor’s financing over ours depending upon cost availability or attractiveness to consumers or other factors typically we do not have or utilize any recourse against these nonexclusive partners when they do not sufficiently promote our products partners may also implement or fail to implement changes in their systems and technologies that may disrupt the integration between their systems and technologies and ours which could disrupt the use of our products the failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as changes they may make in their business models that negatively impact card usage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition if our partners engage in improper business practices do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements or other contractual arrangements or standards or otherwise diminish the value of our brand we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our results are impacted to a significant extent by the financial performance of our partners 

our ability to generate new loans and the interest and fees and other income associated with them is dependent upon sales of merchandise and services by our partners the retail and healthcare industries in which our partners operate are intensely competitive our partners compete with retailers and department stores in their own geographic areas as well as catalog and internet sales businesses our partners in the healthcare industry compete with other healthcare providers our partners’ sales may decrease or may not increase as we anticipate for various reasons some of which are in the partners’ control and some of which are not for example partner sales may be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions having a national regional or more local effect on consumer spending business conditions affecting a particular partner or industry or catastrophes affecting broad or more discrete geographic areas if our partners’ sales decline for any reason it generally results in lower credit sales and therefore lower loan volume and associated interest and fees and other income for us from their customers in addition if a partner closes some or all of its stores or becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding or if there is a perception that it may become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding its customers who have used our financing products may have less incentive to pay their outstanding balances to us which could result in higher chargeoff rates than anticipated and our costs for servicing its customers’ accounts may increase this risk is particularly acute with respect to our largest partners that account for a significant amount of our interest and fees on loans see “ —a significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations ” moreover if the financial condition of a partner deteriorates significantly or a partner becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding we may not be able to recover for customer returns customer payments made in partner stores or other amounts due to us from the partner a decrease in sales by our partners for any reason or a bankruptcy proceeding involving any of them could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

cyberattacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our partners and our customers we also have arrangements in place with our partners and other third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business continuity programs our facilities and systems and those of our partners and thirdparty service providers are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events we and our partners and thirdparty service providers have experienced all of these events in the past and expect to continue to experience them in the future these events could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services although the impact to date from these events has not had a material adverse effect on us we cannot be sure this will be the case in the future 

information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies including mobile and other connected devices to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime perpetrators of fraud hackers terrorists and others in addition to cyberattacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions that are designed to disrupt key business services such as consumerfacing web sites our successful business performance and marketing efforts may increase our profile and therefore our risk of being targeted for cyberattacks and other security breaches including attacks targeting our key business services and websites we are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources we employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection 

we also face risks related to cyberattacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various thirdparties including our partners retailers that are not our partners where our dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards are used merchant acquiring banks payment processors card networks eg visa and mastercard and our processors eg first data and fiserv some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyberattacks and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure future security breaches or cyberattacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them we also rely on numerous other thirdparty service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them while we regularly conduct security assessments of significant thirdparty service providers we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach 

the access by unauthorized persons to or the improper disclosure by us of confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information software methodologies and business secrets could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition there have been a number of wellpublicized attacks or breaches directed at others in our industry that have heightened concern by consumers generally about the security of using credit cards which have caused some consumers including our customers to use our credit cards less in favor of alternative methods of payment and has led to increased regulatory focus on and potentially new regulations relating to these matters further cyberattacks or other breaches in the future whether affecting us or others could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of our cards and increased costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

adverse financial market conditions or our inability to effectively manage our funding and liquidity risk could have a material adverse effect on our funding liquidity and ability to meet our obligations 

we need to effectively manage our funding and liquidity in order to meet our cash requirements such as daytoday operating expenses extensions of credit to our customers payments of principal and interest on our borrowings and payments on our other obligations our primary sources of funding and liquidity are collections from our customers deposits funds from securitized financings and proceeds from unsecured borrowings if we do not have sufficient liquidity we may not be able to meet our obligations particularly during a liquidity stress event if we maintain or are required to maintain too much liquidity it could be costly and reduce our financial flexibility 

we will need additional financing in the future to refinance any existing debt and finance growth of our business the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as financial market conditions generally including the availability of credit to the financial services industry consumers’ willingness to place money on deposit in the bank our performance and credit ratings and the performance of our securitized portfolios disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital credit or deposit markets such as the uncertainty and volatility experienced in the capital and credit markets during the financial crisis and more recently arising from the sovereign debt crisis in europe and other economic and political conditions in the global markets and concerning the level of us government debt and fiscal measures that may be taken over the longer term to address these matters may limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance maturing liabilities on desired terms including funding costs in a timely manner or at all as a result we may be forced to delay obtaining funding or be forced to issue or raise funding on undesirable terms which could significantly reduce our financial flexibility and cause us to contract or not grow our business all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions 

in addition at december 31 2016 we had an aggregate of 67 billion  of undrawn credit facilities subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under our existing securitization programs and an unsecured revolving credit facility our ability to draw on such commitments is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including the applicable securitization trust having sufficient collateral to support the draw and the absence of an early amortization event moreover there are regulatory reforms that have recently been proposed or adopted in the united states and internationally that are intended to address certain issues that affected banks in the recent financial crisis these reforms generally referred to as “basel iii” subject banks to more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements to the extent that the basel iii requirements result in increased costs to the banks providing undrawn committed capacity under our securitization programs these costs are likely to be passed on to us in addition in response to basel iii some banks in the market including certain of the private lenders in our securitization programs have added provisions to their credit agreements permitting them to delay disbursement of funding requests for 30 days or more if our bank lenders require delayed disbursements of funding andor higher pricing for committing undrawn capacity to us our cost of funding and access to liquidity could be adversely affected 

while financial market conditions have generally stabilized and improved since the financial crisis there can be no assurance that significant disruptions uncertainties and volatility will not occur in the future if we are unable to continue to finance our business access capital markets and attract deposits on favorable terms and in a timely manner or if we experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

a reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

our senior unsecured debt currently is rated bbb stable outlook by fitch ratings inc “fitch” and bbb stable outlook by standard  poor’s “sp” although we have not requested that moody’s investor services inc “moody’s” provide a rating for our senior unsecured debt we believe that if moody’s were to issue a rating on our unsecured debt its rating would be lower than the comparable ratings issued by fitch and sp the ratings for our unsecured debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors that may not be within our control such as macroeconomic conditions and the rating agencies’ perception of the industries in which we operate and the products we offer the ratings of our assetbacked securities are and will continue to be based on a number of factors including the quality of the underlying loans and the credit enhancement structure with respect to each series of assetbacked securities as well as our credit rating as sponsor and servicer of our publicly registered securitization trust these ratings also reflect the various methodologies and assumptions used by the rating agencies which are subject to change and could adversely affect our ratings the rating agencies regularly evaluate our credit ratings as well as the credit ratings of our assetbacked securities a downgrade in our unsecured debt or assetbacked securities credit ratings or investor concerns that a downgrade may occur could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

if the ratings on our assetbacked securities are reduced put on negative watch or withdrawn it may have an adverse effect on the liquidity or the market price of our assetbacked securities and on the cost of or our ability to continue using securitized financings to the extent anticipated 

our inability to securitize our loans would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition 

we use the securitization of loans which involves the transfer of loans to a trust and the issuance by the trust of assetbacked securities to thirdparty investors as a significant source of funding our average level of securitized financings from third parties was 124 billion  and 138 billion  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively for a discussion of our securitization activities see “ item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—funding liquidity and capital resources—funding sources—securitized financings ” and note 5 variable interest entities  to our consolidated and combined financial statements 

although the securitization market for credit cards has been reestablished since the financial crisis that began in 2008 there can be no assurance that the market will not experience future disruptions the extent to which we securitize our loans in the future will depend in part upon the conditions in the securities markets in general and the credit card assetbacked securities market in particular the overall credit quality of our loans and the conformity of the loans and our securitization program to rating agency requirements the costs of securitizing our loans and the legal regulatory accounting and tax requirements governing securitization transactions in the event we are unable to refinance existing assetbacked securities from our publicly registered securitization trust with new securities from the same trust there are structural and regulatory constraints on our ability to refinance these assetbacked securities with bank deposits or other funding at the bank and therefore we would be required to rely on sources outside of the bank which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost a prolonged inability to securitize our loans on favorable terms or at all or to refinance our assetbacked securities would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition 

the occurrence of an early amortization of our securitization facilities would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds 

our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events resulting in the early amortization of our existing securitized financings during an early amortization period principal collections from the loans in our assetbacked securitization trusts would be applied to repay principal of the assetbacked securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund purchases of newly originated loans this would negatively impact our liquidity including our ability to originate new loans under existing accounts and require us to rely on alternative funding sources which might increase our funding costs or might not be available when needed 

our loss of the right to service or subservice our securitized loans would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds 

synchrony currently acts as servicer with respect to our publicly registered securitization trust and its related series of assetbacked securities and the bank acts as servicer with respect to our other securitization trust if synchrony or the bank as applicable defaults in its servicing obligations an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant assetbacked securities andor synchrony or the bank as applicable could be replaced as servicer servicer defaults include for example the failure of the servicer to make any payment transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents a breach of representations warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents the delegation of the servicer’s duties contrary to the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer such an amortization event would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor 

if either synchrony or the bank defaults in its servicing obligations with respect to the applicable securitization trust a third party could be appointed as servicer of such trust if a thirdparty servicer is appointed there is no assurance that the third party will engage us as subservicer in which event we would no longer be able to control the manner in which the related trust’s assets are serviced and the failure of a third party to appropriately service such assets could lead to an early amortization event in the affected securitization trust which would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor 

lower payment rates on our securitized loans could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

certain collections from our securitized loans come back to us through our subsidiaries and we use these collections to fund our purchase of newly originated loans to collateralize our securitized financings if payment rates on our securitized loans are lower than they have historically been fewer collections will be remitted to us on an ongoing basis further certain series of our assetbacked securities include a requirement that we accumulate principal collections in a restricted account for a specified number of months prior to the applicable security’s maturity date we are required under the program documents to lengthen this accumulation period to the extent we expect the payment rates to be low enough that the current length of the accumulation period is inadequate to fully fund the restricted account by the applicable security’s maturity date lower payment rates and in particular payment rates that are low enough that we are required to lengthen our accumulation periods could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

our inability to grow our deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to grow our business 

we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers or through brokerage firms that offer our deposit products to their customers at december 31 2016  we had 379 billion  in direct deposits which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions and 142 billion  in deposits originated through brokerage firms including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger who channels brokerage account deposits to us a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to fund our growth through direct deposits 

the deposit business is highly competitive with intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits we compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits features and benefits of our products the quality of our customer service and the competitiveness of our digital banking capabilities our ability to originate and maintain retail deposits is also highly dependent on the strength of the bank and the perceptions of consumers and others of our business practices and our financial health adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to difficulties in attracting and retaining deposits accounts negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas including lending practices regulatory compliance inadequate protection of customer information or sales and marketing activities and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct 

the demand for the deposit products we offer may also be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns changes in customer preferences reductions in consumers’ disposable income regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products competition from other financial services firms and others that use deposit funding products may affect deposit renewal rates costs or availability changes we make to the rates offered on our deposit products may affect our profitability and liquidity 

the fdia prohibits an insured bank from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “well capitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates there are no such restrictions under the fdia on a bank that is “well capitalized” and at december 31 2016 the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed “well capitalized” for purposes of the fdia however there can be no assurance that the bank will continue to meet those requirements limitations on the bank’s ability to accept brokered deposits for any reason including regulatory limitations on the amount of brokered deposits in total or as a percentage of total assets in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity any limitation on the interest rates the bank can pay on deposits could competitively disadvantage us in attracting and retaining deposits and have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings funding and liquidity 

changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks at december 31 2016  556  of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer with the remaining 444  at a floating interest rate we fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits assetbacked securities and unsecured debt the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is the prime rate and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the federal funds rate the prime rate and libor or the federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities to the extent we are unable to position the balance sheet naturally or using derivatives to effectively match the interest rates on our assets and liabilities our net earnings could be materially adversely affected 

competitive and regulatory factors may limit our ability to raise interest rates on our loans in addition some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers if interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner or at all our net interest margin could be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay amounts owed to us our floating rate credit products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies bankruptcies chargeoffs allowances for loan losses and decreasing recoveries all of which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity 

we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the net interest income impact of various interest rate scenarios we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our net earnings and could also increase our funding costs and reduce our liquidity especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different from our assumptions for a discussion of interest rate risk sensitivities see “ item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective in mitigating our risks 

our risk management processes and procedures seek to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate risks we have established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor and control the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk including compliance risk and strategic risk credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation we are exposed to both consumer credit risk from our customer loans and institutional credit risk principally from our partners market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet obligations and support business growth operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes people or systems external events ie natural disasters or compliance reputational or legal matters and includes those risks as they relate directly to us as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business strategic risk is the risk from changes in the business environment improper implementation of decisions or inadequate responsiveness to changes in the business environment see “ item 1 business—credit risk management ” and “ risk management ” for additional information on the types of risks affecting our business 

we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework that includes our risk appetite statement era process risk policies procedures and controls reporting requirements and corporate culture and values in conjunction with the risk management accountability incorporated into our integrated risk management framework which includes our governance structure and three distinct lines of defense management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models if the models that we use to manage these risks are ineffective at predicting future losses or are otherwise inadequate we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected in addition the information we use in managing our credit and other risk may be inaccurate or incomplete as a result of error or fraud both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid there may also be risks that exist or that develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated including when processes are changed or new products and services are introduced if our risk management framework does not effectively identify and control our risks we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected and that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business and if they are not accurate or are misinterpreted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business including liquidity and capital planning including stress testing customer selection credit and other risk management pricing reserving and collections management the models may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect for a variety of reasons including as a result of errors in constructing interpreting or using the models or the use of inaccurate assumptions including failures to update assumptions appropriately or in a timely manner our assumptions may be inaccurate for many reasons including that they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and beyond our control eg macroeconomic conditions and their impact on partner and customer behaviors and they often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables factors and other assumptions the errors or inaccuracies in our models may be material and could lead us to make wrong or suboptimal decisions in managing our business and this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and failing to do so may result in high chargeoff rates 

our success depends on our ability to manage our credit risk while attracting new customers with profitable usage patterns we select our customers manage their accounts and establish terms and credit limits using proprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques that are designed to set terms and credit limits to appropriately compensate us for the credit risk we accept while encouraging customers to use their available credit the models and approaches we use to manage our credit risk may not accurately predict future chargeoffs for various reasons discussed in the preceding risk factor 

our ability to manage credit risk and avoid high chargeoff rates also may be adversely affected by economic conditions that may be difficult to predict such as the recent financial crisis the assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix account maturation as well as broader consumer trends such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness during 2016 these factors have contributed to an increase in our delinquent accounts and our forecasted net chargeoff rate over the next twelve months we believe the delinquency rate and net chargeoff rate in our portfolio will continue to increase modestly from the low credit trends we have experienced in the last two years and are likely to increase materially if economic conditions deteriorate in addition we remain subject to conditions in the consumer credit environment there can be no assurance that our credit underwriting and risk management strategies will enable us to avoid high chargeoff levels or delinquencies or that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover actual losses 

a customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders under mortgage credit card and other loans including student loans these changes can result from increases in base lending rates or structured increases in payment obligations and could reduce the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations to other lenders and to us in addition a customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by the restricted availability of credit to consumers generally including reduced and closed lines of credit customers with insufficient cash flow to fund daily living expenses and lack of access to other sources of credit may be more likely to increase their card usage and ultimately default on their payment obligations to us resulting in higher credit losses in our portfolio our collection operations may not compete effectively to secure more of customers’ diminished cash flow than our competitors we may not identify customers who are likely to default on their payment obligations to us and reduce our exposure by closing credit lines and restricting authorizations quickly enough which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition our collection strategy depends in part on the sale of debt to thirdparty buyers regulatory or other factors may adversely affect the pricing of our debt sales or the performance of our thirdparty buyers which may result in higher credit losses in our portfolio at december 31 2016  270  of our portfolio’s loan receivables were from customers with a fico score of 660 or less excluding unrated accounts who typically have higher delinquency and credits losses than consumers with higher fico scores 

our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations and collection regulations competitors’ actions and consumer behavior as well as inadequate collections staffing techniques models and performance of vendors such as collection agencies 

our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to cover losses on our loans 

we maintain an allowance for loan losses a reserve established through a provision for losses charged to expense that we believe is appropriate to provide for incurred losses in our loan portfolio in addition for portfolios we may acquire when we enter into new partner program agreements any deterioration in the performance of the purchased portfolios after acquisition results in incremental loss reserves growth in our loan portfolio generally would lead to an increase in the allowance for loan losses 

the process for establishing an allowance for loan losses is critical to our results of operations and financial condition and requires complex models and judgments including forecasts of economic conditions changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding our loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses we may underestimate our incurred losses and fail to maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to account for these losses in cases where we modify a loan if the modified loans do not perform as anticipated we may be required to establish additional allowances on these loans 

we periodically review and update our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to establish our allowance for loan losses to reflect our view of current conditions moreover our regulators as part of their supervisory function periodically review the methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use for calculating and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses our regulators based on their judgment may conclude that we should modify our methodology models or the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments increase our allowance for loan losses andor recognize further losses we continue to review and evaluate our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use and we will implement further enhancements or changes to them as needed we cannot assure you that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses future increases in the allowance for loan losses or recognized losses as a result of any review update regulatory guidance or otherwise will result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements are incorrect or are required to change our reported results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are required to make various assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements under gaap including for purposes of determining allowances for loan losses asset impairment reserves related to litigation and other legal matters valuation of income and other taxes and regulatory exposures and the amounts recorded for certain contractual payments to be paid to or received from partners and others under contractual arrangements in addition significant assumptions and estimates are involved in determining certain disclosures required under gaap including those involving the fair value of our financial instruments if the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect the actual amounts realized on transactions and balances subject to those estimates will be different and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently reviewing or proposing changes to several financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of our financial statements and other areas where assumptions or estimates are required and has recently issued asu 201613 the standard on accounting for credit losses as a result of changes to financial accounting or reporting standards whether promulgated or required by the fasb or other regulators we could be required to change certain of the assumptions or estimates we previously used in preparing our financial statements which could materially impact how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition generally for additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements see “ item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting estimates ” and note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated and combined financial statements 

we may not be able to offset increases in our costs with decreased payments under our retailer share arrangements which could reduce our profitability 

most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the relevant program exceeds a contractually defined threshold although the share arrangements vary by partner these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program based typically on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold however because the threshold and the economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on among other things agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses we may not be able to pass on increases in our actual expenses such as funding costs or operating expenses in the form of reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements and our economic return on a program could be adversely affected while most of our agreements contain retailer share arrangements in some cases where we instead provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts for example on our cobranded credit cards our ability to offset increases in our costs is limited 

competition in the consumer finance industry is intense 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners the competition for partners is intense and becoming more competitive our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as alliance data systems american express capital one jpmorgan chase citibank td bank and wells fargo and to a lesser extent potential partners’ own inhouse financing capabilities some of our competitors are substantially larger have substantially greater resources and may offer a broader range of products and services we compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors including program financial and other terms underwriting standards marketing expertise service levels product and service offerings including incentive and loyalty programs technological capabilities and integration brand and reputation in addition some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting eg new account approval customer service and collections and other core banking responsibilities that we retain but some partners may prefer to handle as a result of competition we may be unable to acquire new partners lose existing relationships to competing companies or find it more costly to maintain our existing relationships 

our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain customers and generate usage of our products by them the consumer credit and payments industry is highly competitive and we face an increasingly dynamic industry as emerging technologies enter the marketplace as a form of payment our products compete with cash checks debit cards general purpose credit cards including visa and mastercard american express and discover card other private label card brands and to a certain extent prepaid cards we also compete with nontraditional providers such as paypal in the future we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies such as apple pay android pay chase pay samsung pay and square to the extent that our products are not accepted in or compatible with such technologies we may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry we compete for customers and their usage of our products and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances based on a number of factors including pricing interest rates and fees product offerings credit limits incentives including loyalty programs and customer service although we offer a variety of consumer credit products some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services including home and automobile loans debit cards and bank branch atm access which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitors advantages including a more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers operational efficiencies more versatile technology platforms broadbased local distribution capabilities and lowercost funding in addition some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage customer attrition from any or all of our credit products or any lowering of the pricing of our products by reducing interest rates or fees in order to retain customers could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings 

in our retail deposits business we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct banking competitors we compete for deposits with traditional banks and in seeking to grow our direct banking business we compete with other banks that have direct banking models similar to ours such as ally financial american express capital one 360 ing discover goldman sachs nationwide sallie mae and usaa competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors 

if we are unable to compete effectively for partners customer usage or deposits our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in that market than a more diversified company 

our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit as a result we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular to us consumer credit than a more diversified company for example our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the us economy consumer spending and consumer credit we are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at consumer credit or the specific consumer credit products that we offer including promotional financing due to our carecredit platform we are also more susceptible to increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions targeted at healthcare related procedures or services in contrast to other industries our business concentration could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services 

our industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technologies products services and consumer preferences a key part of our financial success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services including with respect to loyalty programs mobile and point of sale technologies and new synchronybranded bank deposit and credit products realizing the benefits of those products and services is uncertain we may not assign the appropriate level of resources priority or expertise to the development and commercialization of these new products services or enhancements our ability to develop acquire or commercialize competitive technologies products or services on acceptable terms or at all may be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert in addition success is dependent on factors such as partner and customer acceptance adoption and usage competition the effectiveness of marketing programs the availability of appropriate technologies and business processes and regulatory approvals success of a new product service or enhancement also may depend upon our ability to deliver it on a large scale which may require a significant investment 

we also may select utilize and invest in technologies products and services that ultimately do not achieve widespread adoption and therefore are not as attractive or useful to our partners customers and service partners as we anticipate or partners may not recognize the value of our new products and services or believe they justify any potential costs or disruptions associated with implementing them in addition because our products and services typically are marketed through our partners if our partners are unwilling or unable to effectively implement our new technologies products services or enhancements we may be unable to grow our business competitors may also develop or adopt technologies or introduce innovations that change the markets we operate in and make our products less competitive and attractive to our partners and customers 

in any event we may not realize the benefit of new technologies products services or enhancements for many years or competitors may introduce more compelling products services or enhancements our failure to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products services or enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may not realize the value of strategic investments that we pursue and such investments could divert resources or introduce unforeseen risks to our business 

we may execute strategic acquisitions or partnerships or make other strategic investments in businesses products technologies or platforms to enhance or grow our business these strategic investments may introduce new costs or liabilities which could impact our ability to grow or maintain acceptable performance 

we may be unable to integrate systems personnel or technologies from our strategic investments these strategic investments may also present unforeseen legal regulatory or other challenges that we may not be able to manage effectively the planning and integration of an acquisition partnership or investment may shift employee time and other resources which could impair our ability to focus on our core business 

strategic investments may not perform as expected due to lack of acceptance by partners customers or employees higher than forecasted costs lengthy transition periods synergies or savings not being realized and a variety of other factors this may result in a delay or unrealized benefit or in some cases increased costs or other unforeseen risks to our business 

reductions in interchange fees may reduce the competitive advantages our private label credit card products currently have by virtue of not charging interchange fees and would reduce our income from those fees 

interchange is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the network’s infrastructure and payment facilitation and which are paid to credit card issuers to compensate them for the risk they bear in lending money to customers we earn interchange fees on dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card transactions but we do not charge or earn interchange fees from our partners or customers on our private label credit card products 

merchants trying to decrease their operating expenses have sought to and have had some success at lowering interchange rates several recent events and actions indicate a continuing increase in focus on interchange by both regulators and merchants beyond pursuing litigation legislation and regulation merchants are also pursuing alternate payment platforms as a means to lower payment processing costs to the extent interchange fees are reduced one of our current competitive advantages with our partners — that we typically do not charge interchange fees when our private label credit card products are used to purchase our partners’ goods and services — may be reduced moreover to the extent interchange fees are reduced our income from those fees will be lower we received approximately 602 million  of interchange fees for the year ended december 31 2016  as a result a reduction in interchange fees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition for our dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards we are subject to the operating regulations and procedures set forth by the interchange network and our failure to comply with these operating regulations which may change from time to time could subject us to various penalties or fees or the termination of our license to use the interchange network all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

fraudulent activity associated with our products and services could negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and cause the use of our products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase 

we are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with partners customers and third parties handling customer information while our fraudrelated losses stabilized in 2016 they have increased significantly in recent years and were 203 million  219 million  and 154 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively our fraudrelated losses have shifted away from counterfeit fraud losses with the implementation of the emv chip in dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards and towards application fraud and mailphone fraud including as a result of wellpublicized security breaches at retailers unrelated to us our products are susceptible to application fraud because among other things we provide immediate access to the credit line at the time of approval in addition sales on the internet and through mobile channels are becoming a larger part of our business and fraudulent activity is higher as a percentage of sales in those channels than in stores dual cards general purpose cobranded credit cards and private label credit cards are susceptible to different types of fraud and depending on our product channel mix including as a result of the introduction if any of a synchronybranded general purpose credit card we may continue to experience variations in or levels of fraudrelated expense that are different from or higher than that experienced by some of our competitors or the industry generally 

the risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry in general and credit card fraud identity theft and related crimes are likely to continue to be prevalent and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated our resources technologies and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud high profile fraudulent activity also could negatively impact our brand and reputation which could negatively impact the use of our cards and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention such as increased customer notification requirements which could increase our costs and also negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and could lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk which could increase our costs 

the failure of third parties to provide various services that are important to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

some services important to our business are outsourced to thirdparty vendors for example our credit card transaction processing production and related services including the printing and mailing of customer statements are handled by first data and the technology platform for our online retail deposits is managed by fiserv first data fiserv and in some cases other thirdparty vendors are the sole source or one of a limited number of sources of the services they provide for us it would be difficult and disruptive for us to replace some of our thirdparty vendors particularly first data and fiserv in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future as a result of their financial or business conditions or otherwise and our business and operations likely would be materially adversely affected first data has publicly disclosed that it is highly leveraged and that it has incurred net losses of 15 billion  and 458 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014 respectively our principal agreement with first data expires in november 2026 unless it is terminated earlier or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof our principal agreement with fiserv expires in march 26 2020 unless it is terminated earlier or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof in addition if a thirdparty provider fails to provide the services we require fails to meet contractual requirements such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations or suffers a cyberattack or other security breach our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

disruptions in the operation of our computer systems and data centers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ability to deliver products and services to our partners and our customers service our loans and otherwise operate our business and comply with applicable laws depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems and data centers as well as those of our partners and thirdparty service providers these computer systems and data centers may encounter service interruptions at any time due to system or software failure natural disaster or other reasons in addition the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain current and integrate new systems may also cause service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause our failure to comply with applicable laws all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer credit industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies and business processes may be better than those we currently use the pace of technology change is high and our industry is intensely competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete and better ones become available a failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less competitive all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have international operations that subject us to various international risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs 

we have international operations primarily in india the philippines and canada and some of our thirdparty service providers provide services to us from other countries all of which subject us to a number of international risks including among other things sovereign volatility and sociopolitical instability for example the philippines has in the past experienced severe political and social instability any future political or social instability in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 

us regulations also govern various aspects of the international activities of domestic corporations and increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs any failure on our part or the part of our service providers to comply with applicable us regulations as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in which we or they operate could result in fines penalties injunctions or other similar restrictions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are alleged to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights owned by others or are not able to protect our intellectual property our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competitors or other third parties may allege that we or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us infringe on their intellectual property rights we also may face allegations that our employees have misappropriated intellectual property of their former employers or other third parties given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation an assertion of an infringement claim against us may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim even if we ultimately prevail pay significant money damages lose significant revenues be prohibited from using the relevant systems processes technologies or other intellectual property cease offering certain products or services or incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses moreover it has become common in recent years for individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees in addition although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs such indemnifying party may refuse or be unable to uphold its contractual obligations 

moreover we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information including copyrights trademarks patents trade secrets and controls on access and distribution these measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage and in any event we may be required to litigate to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information from misappropriation or infringement by others which is expensive could cause a diversion of resources and may not be successful third parties may challenge invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property or our intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages our competitors or other third parties may independently design around or develop similar technology or otherwise duplicate our services or products such that we could not assert our intellectual property rights against them in addition our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure 

we have launched our new brand “synchrony” and expect to spend significant amounts over the next few years promoting the new brand we recently filed trademark applications to protect our new name in the united states and certain other countries but the registrations of many of these trademarks are not complete and they may ultimately not become registered our use of our new name for our existing or any new products in the united states or other countries may be challenged by third parties and we may become involved in legal proceedings to protect or defend our rights with respect to our new name all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses 

our business is subject to increased risks of litigation and regulatory actions as a result of a number of factors and from various sources including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry 

in the normal course of business from time to time we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business activities certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in addition while historically the arbitration provision in our customer agreements generally has limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future there may also be legislative administrative or regulatory efforts to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of predispute arbitration clauses or we may be compelled as a result of competitive pressure or reputational concerns to voluntarily eliminate predispute arbitration clauses in march 2015 the cfpb issued a report scrutinizing predispute arbitration clauses and in may 2016 the cfpb published a proposed rule that would substantially curtail our ability to enter into voluntary predispute arbitration clauses with consumers the proposed rule would prevent us from including arbitration clauses in consumer contracts unless the clauses expressly permit class actions to proceed in court and require us to provide copies of consumer arbitration agreements claims and decisions to the cfpb for potential publication if the cfpb proposals are adopted our exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly 

we are also involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business collectively “regulatory matters” which could subject us to significant fines penalties obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses diminished earnings and damage to our reputation the current environment of additional regulation increased regulatory compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may prevent or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services there is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will not in the future affect how we conduct our business and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we contest liability andor the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter the outcome of pending and future matters could be material to our results of operations financial condition and cash flows depending on among other factors the level of our earnings for that period and could adversely affect our business and reputation for a discussion of certain legal proceedings see “ item 1   business—regulation—consumer financial services regulation ” note 17 legal proceedings and regulatory matters  to our consolidated and combined financial statements and “ item 3   legal proceedings ” 

in addition to litigation and regulatory matters from time to time through our operational and compliance controls we identify compliance issues that require us to make operational changes and depending on the nature of the issue result in financial remediation to impacted cardholders these selfidentified issues and voluntary remediation payments could be significant depending on the issue and the number of cardholders impacted they also could generate litigation or regulatory investigations that subject us to additional adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business 

recently financial services companies have been experiencing increased reputational risk as consumers take issue with certain of their practices or judgments maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining customers partners investors and employees in particular adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could also make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy of increasing retail deposits at the bank and may lead to decreases in deposits harm to our reputation can arise from many sources including employee misconduct misconduct by our partners outsourced service providers or other counterparties litigation or regulatory actions failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality inadequate protection of customer information and compliance failures negative publicity regarding us or others engaged in a similar business or activities whether or not accurate may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and motivate key officers and employees 

our success depends in large part on our ability to retain recruit and motivate key officers and employees our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for senior executives in the financial services and payment industry is intense we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel guidelines issued by the federal banking regulators prohibits our payment of excessive compensation or compensation that could lead to our material financial loss to our executives employees and directors in addition proposed rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the doddfrank act would limit the type and structure of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our senior executives and persons deemed significant risktakers these restrictions could negatively impact our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting retaining and motivating key personnel failure to retain talented senior leadership could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions and we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives may be proposed such as proposals for fundamental tax reform in the united states and lowering the corporate tax rate which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our deferred tax assets tax positions andor our tax liabilities in addition us federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our historical tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in defending our position in connection with any such challenge 

state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could change and adversely affect our results of operations 

state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could adversely affect our results of operations retailers collect sales tax from retail customers and remit those collections to the applicable states when customers fail to repay their loans including the amount of sales tax advanced by us to the merchant on their behalf we are entitled in some cases to seek a refund of the amount of sales tax from the applicable state sales tax laws and regulations enacted by the various states are subject to interpretation and our compliance with such laws is routinely subject to audit and review by the states audit risk is concentrated in several states and these states are conducting ongoing audits the outcomes of ongoing and any future audits and changes in the states’ interpretation of the sales tax laws and regulations involving the recovery of tax on bad debts could materially adversely impact our results of operations 

we could have a material indemnification obligation to ge under the tssa if we cause the splitoff from ge or certain preliminary transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment or in the case of certain significant transfers of our stock following the splitoff from ge 

ge completed its exit from its investment in us in an exchange offer that concluded in november 2015 resulting in our splitoff from ge the splitoff was designed to qualify for tax­free treatment to ge and its shareholders under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” ge obtained a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain issues relating to the tax­free treatment of the splitoff and a series of preliminary transactions that occurred prior to implementing the exchange offer although the irs private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the irs private letter ruling the irs private letter ruling addresses only certain aspects of the transaction as a result ge obtained an opinion from tax counsel confirming the taxfree treatment of the splitoff the opinion is based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by us and ge if any of those factual representations or assumptions in the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion are untrue or incomplete in any material respect any undertaking is not complied with or the facts upon which the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion was based are materially different from the facts at the time of the distribution the splitoff may not qualify for tax­free treatment opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs as a result the conclusions expressed in the opinion of counsel could be challenged by the irs and if the irs prevails in such challenge the tax consequences of the splitoff could be materially less favorable if the splitoff or any of the preliminary transactions is determined to be taxable ge and its shareholders could incur significant tax liabilities and under the tssa we entered into with ge we may be required to indemnify ge for any liabilities incurred by ge if the liabilities are caused by any action or inaction undertaken by us following the ipo or as a result of any direct or indirect transfers of our stock following the exchange offer 

in order to preserve the tax­free status of the splitoff and the preliminary transactions to ge the tssa includes a provision generally prohibiting us from taking any action or inaction that is within our control other than actions or inactions that implemented the splitoff or certain preliminary transactions or actions or inactions that are consented to by ge or are at the direction of ge that would cause the splitoff or the preliminary transactions to become taxable and providing for an indemnity obligation from us to ge for tax liabilities incurred by ge as a result of a breach of these provisions by us or as a result of any direct or indirect transfers of our stock following the exchange offer as a result we may not as part of a plan that includes the exchange offer enter into certain mergers or other change of control transactions 

risks relating to regulation 

 

our business is subject to government regulation supervision examination and enforcement which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business including our relationships with our customers is subject to regulation supervision and examination under us federal state and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending and collection practices treatment of our customers safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure liquidity dividends and other capital distributions transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel as a savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as a large provider of consumer financial services we are also subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb the bank is a federally chartered savings association as such the bank is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ which is its primary regulator and by the cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic we including the bank are regularly reviewed and examined by our respective regulators which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require response and attention see “ item 1   business—regulation ” for more information about the regulations applicable to us 

banking laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect federally insured deposits the dif and the banking system as a whole and not intended to protect our stockholders noteholders or creditors if we fail to satisfy applicable laws and regulations our respective regulators have broad discretion to enforce those laws and regulations including with respect to the operation of our business required capital levels payment of dividends and other capital distributions engaging in certain activities and making acquisitions and investments our regulators also have broad discretion with respect to the enforcement of applicable laws and regulations including through enforcement actions that could subject us to civil money penalties customer remediation programs increased compliance costs and limits or prohibitions on our ability to offer certain products and services or to engage in certain activities in addition to the extent we undertake actions requiring regulatory approval or nonobjection our regulators may make their approval or nonobjection subject to conditions or restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition any other actions taken by our regulators could also have a material adverse impact on our business reputation and brand results of operations and financial condition moreover some of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less restrictive legislative and regulatory regimes which may have the effect of providing them with a competitive advantage over us 

new laws or regulations or policy or practical changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or our own reexamination of our current practices could adversely impact our profitability limit our ability to continue existing or pursue new business activities require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with customers affect retention of our key personnel or expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs andor customer remediation these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for example the cfpb has broad authority over our business see “ —there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureau’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business ” 

we are also subject to potential enforcement and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties and fines customer remediation programs and increased compliance costs as well as damage our reputation and brand and limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices for a discussion of risks related to actions or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies see “ —risks relating to our business—litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses ” 

the doddfrank act has had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the doddfrank act was enacted on july 21 2010 while certain provisions in the act were effective immediately many of the provisions require implementing regulations to be effective the doddfrank act and regulations promulgated thereunder have had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition for example the doddfrank act and related regulations restrict certain business practices impose more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements as well as additional costs including increased compliance costs and increased costs of funding raised through the issuance of assetbacked securities on us limit the fees we can charge for services and impact the value of our assets in addition the doddfrank act requires us to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution we control such as the bank such support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interest of synchrony or its stockholders noteholders or creditors we describe certain provisions of the doddfrank act and other legislative and regulatory developments in “ item 1   business—regulation ” federal agencies continue to promulgate regulations to implement the doddfrank act and these regulations may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many provisions of the doddfrank act require the adoption of additional rules to implement in addition the doddfrank act mandates multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action as a result the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations remains unclear and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureau’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business 

the cfpb which commenced operations in july 2011 has broad authority over our business this includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions such as us for compliance the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory supervisory and enforcement authority the federal reserve board and the occ and state government agencies may also invoke their supervisory and enforcement authorities to prevent unfair and deceptive acts or practices these federal and state agencies are authorized to remediate violations of consumer protection laws in a number of ways including collecting civil money penalties and fines and providing for customer restitution the cfpb also engages in consumer financial education requests data and promotes the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities in addition the cfpb maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the products we offer this system could inform future cfpb decisions with respect to its regulatory enforcement or examination focus there continues to be uncertainty as to how the cfpb’s strategies and priorities including in both its examination and enforcement processes will impact our business and our results of operations going forward actions by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services including deferred interest products making them less attractive to consumers less profitable to us and restricting our ability to offer them for example since 2013 the bank has entered into two consent orders with the cfpb  one in 2013 the 2013 cfpb consent order which required us to provide remediation to certain customers and to make a number of changes to our carecredit training sales marketing and servicing practices and another in 2014 the 2014 cfpb consent order and together with the 2013 consent order the consent orders with respect to a debt cancellation product and sales practices and an unrelated issue that arose from the bank’s selfidentified omission of certain spanishspeaking customers and customers residing in puerto rico from two offers that were made to certain delinquent customers some of the business practice changes required by the 2013 consent order are similar to requirements in an assurance of discontinuance that the bank entered into with the attorney general for the state of new york in 2013 the bank’s resolutions with the cfpb and the new york attorney general do not preclude other regulators or state attorneys general from seeking additional monetary or injunctive relief with respect to carecredit and any such relief could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

although we have committed significant resources to enhancing our compliance programs changes by the cfpb in regulatory expectations interpretations or practices or interpretations that are different or stricter than ours or those adopted in the past by other regulators could increase the risk of additional enforcement actions fines and penalties for example in december 2015 the cfpb published its second biennial report reviewing the consumer credit card market in the report the cfpb identified areas of concern for consumers including deferred interest products subprime specialist credit card issuers and unexpected rate increases with respect to variable interest rate products in addition the report analyzed issues regarding debt sales and debt collection practices the adequacy and availability of online disclosures as well as of the disclosures associated with rewards products and grace periods actions by the cfpb with respect to any of these areas could result in requirements to alter our products and services that may make them less attractive to consumers or less profitable to us 

future actions by the cfpb or other regulators against us or our competitors that discourage the use of products we offer or suggest to consumers the desirability of other products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of customers if the cfpb changes regulations which were adopted in the past by other regulators and transferred to the cfpb by the doddfrank act or modifies through supervision or enforcement past related regulatory guidance or interprets existing regulations in a different or stricter manner than they have been interpreted in the past by us the industry or other regulators our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if future regulatory or legislative restrictions or prohibitions are imposed that affect our ability to offer promotional financing including deferred interest for certain of our products or require us to make significant changes to our business practices and we are unable to develop compliant alternatives with acceptable returns these restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the doddfrank act authorizes state officials to enforce regulations issued by the cfpb and to enforce the act’s general prohibition against unfair deceptive or abusive practices this could make it more difficult than in the past for federal financial regulators to declare state laws that differ from federal standards to be preempted to the extent that states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or state officials and courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer laws that differ from those adopted by the cfpb we may be required to alter or cease offering products or services in some jurisdictions which would increase compliance costs and reduce our ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide and we may be subject to a higher risk of state enforcement actions 

failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

synchrony and the bank must meet rules for capital adequacy as discussed in “ item 1 business—regulation ” as a standalone savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to capital requirements similar to those that apply to the bank we cannot predict the effects of these capital requirements on synchrony in addition synchrony and the bank may be subject to increasingly stringent capital adequacy standards in the future 

synchrony and the bank must also comply with regulatory requirements related to the maintenance management monitoring and reporting of liquidity as discussed in “ item 1 business—regulation ” these liquidity requirements are new and synchrony and the bank may become subject to additional liquidity requirements in the future we cannot predict the effects of such liquidity requirements on synchrony the bank is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and as of january 1 2017 synchrony is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the occ’s and the federal reserve board’s stress test regulations the bank and synchrony are required to use stresstesting methodologies providing for results under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress in addition although as a savings and loan holding company synchrony currently is not subject to the federal reserve board’s ccar rule the federal reserve board may in the future require synchrony to comply with the ccar process or some modified version of the ccar process under such process   the federal reserve board would measure synchronys regulatory capital levels under various stress scenarios further while as a savings and loan holding company synchrony currently is not subject to the federal reserve board’s capital planning rule synchrony prepares and submits a form of capital plan to the federal reserve board for its review and synchrony may in the future be required to seek the federal reserve board’s review and approval of its capital plan consistent with the capital planning rule to the extent synchrony is made subject to the ccar process or the capital planning rule synchronys ability to return capital to shareholders or to reinvest capital in its business may be curtailed 

if synchrony or the bank fails to meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements its operations results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected among other things failure by synchrony or the bank to maintain its status as “well capitalized” or otherwise meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements could compromise our competitive position and result in restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board or the occ including potentially on the bank’s ability to engage in certain activities these could include restrictions on the bank’s ability to enter into transactions with affiliates accept brokered deposits grow its assets engage in material transactions extend credit in certain highly leveraged transactions amend or change its charter bylaws or accounting methods pay interest on its liabilities without regard to regulatory caps on the rates that may be paid on deposits and pay dividends or repurchase stock in addition failure to maintain the well capitalized status of the bank could result in our having to invest additional capital in the bank which could in turn require us to raise additional capital the market and demand for and cost of our assetbacked securities also could be adversely affected by failure to meet current or future capital requirements 

we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness 

we are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock by the federal reserve board which has broad authority to review our capital planning and risk management processes and our current projected and stressed capital levels and to object to any capital action that the federal reserve board considers to be unsafe or unsound in addition the declaration and amount of any future dividends to holders of our common stock or stock repurchases will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including the financial condition earnings capital and liquidity requirements of us and the bank applicable regulatory requirements corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant if we are unable to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of synchrony financial see “ item 1   businessregulation—savings and loan holding company regulationdividends and stock repurchases ” 

we rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity including to pay our obligations under our indebtedness and other indebtedness as they become due and federal law limits the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us for example occ regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital including payment of dividends stock redemptions and repurchases cashout mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account the bank must obtain the occ’s approval prior to making a capital distribution in certain circumstances including if the bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements or will not do so as a result of the proposed capital distribution or certain net income requirements in addition the bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared dividend or other distribution with the federal reserve board the federal reserve board or the occ may object to a capital distribution if among other things the bank is or as a result of such dividend or distribution would be undercapitalized or the federal reserve board or occ has safety and soundness concerns additional restrictions on bank dividends may apply if the bank fails the qtl test the application of these restrictions on the bank’s ability to pay dividends involves broad discretion on the part of our regulators limitations on the bank’s payments of dividends and other distributions and payments that we receive from the bank could reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to pay dividends or our obligations under our indebtedness see “ item 1   business—regulation—savings association regulation—dividends and stock repurchases ” and “ —activities ” 

regulations relating to privacy information security and data protection could increase our costs affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities 

we are subject to various privacy information security and data protection laws including requirements concerning security breach notification and we could be negatively impacted by them for example in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the glba and implementing regulations and guidance among other things the glba i imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties ii requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties with certain exceptions and iii requires financial institutions to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches 

moreover various united states federal banking regulatory agencies states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual consumer regulatory andor law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach many of these requirements also apply broadly to our partners that accept our cards in many countries that have yet to impose data security breach notification requirements regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data security breaches 

furthermore legislators andor regulators in the united states and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy data protection and information securityrelated practices our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer andor employee information and some of our current or planned business activities this could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives in the united states this includes increased privacyrelated enforcement activity at the federal level by the federal trade commission as well as at the state level such as with regard to mobile applications 

compliance with current or future privacy data protection and information security laws including those regarding security breach notification affecting customer andor employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services such as products or services that involve us sharing information with third parties or storing sensitive credit card information which could materially and adversely affect our profitability our failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory investigations and government actions litigation fines or sanctions consumer or partner actions and damage to our reputation and our brand all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our use of thirdparty vendors and our other ongoing thirdparty business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention 

we regularly use thirdparty vendors and subcontractors as part of our business we also have substantial ongoing business relationships with our partners and other third parties these types of thirdparty relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic and our consumer financial services regulator the cfpb regulatory guidance requires us to enhance our due diligence ongoing monitoring and control over our thirdparty vendors and subcontractors and other ongoing thirdparty business relationships including with our partners in certain cases we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors andor their subcontractors to meet these enhanced requirements which could increase our costs we expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our thirdparty relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships as a result if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our thirdparty vendors and subcontractors or other ongoing thirdparty business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately we could be subject to enforcement actions including the imposition of civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation 

failure to comply with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us 

we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act and the usa patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale these controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments we cannot be sure our programs and controls will be effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in may 2016 the financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” promulgated a final rule under the bank secrecy act that requires the bank to adopt due diligence procedures to identify and verify a legal entity customer’s beneficial owners at the time a new account is opened and to understand the nature and purpose of the customer relationship the bank will be required to comply with the final rule by may 11 2018 and is currently working on changes to its product and channel strategies application and servicing processes and systems to ensure compliance

as a savings and loan holding company our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or to repurchase our stock is subject to regulation by the federal reserve board in addition as a holding company we rely significantly on dividends distributions and other payments from the bank to fund dividends to our stockholders the ability of the bank to make dividends and other distributions and payments to us is subject to regulation by the occ and the federal reserve board see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us ” and “ —we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness ”

introduction and business overview 

 

we   are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the united states we provide a range of credit products through programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers local merchants manufacturers buying groups industry associations and healthcare service providers which we refer to as our “partners” during 2016  we financed 1255  billion of purchase volume and at december 31 2016  we had 763  billion of loan receivables and 719 million active accounts for the year ended december 31 2016  we had net earnings of 23  billion representing a return on assets of 27  

we offer our credit products primarily through our whollyowned subsidiary synchrony bank the bank through the bank we offer directly to retail and commercial customers a range of deposit products insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” we have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities at december 31 2016  we had 521  billion in deposits which represented 72  of our total funding sources 

our separation from ge 

in november 2015 synchrony financial became a standalone savings and loan holding company following the completion of ges exchange offer in which ge exchanged shares of ge common stock for all of the shares of our common stock it owned the “separation” 

our sales platforms 

 

we conduct our operations through a single business segment profitability and expenses including funding costs loan losses and operating expenses are managed for the business as a whole substantially all of our operations are within the united states we offer our credit products through three sales platforms retail card payment solutions and carecredit those platforms are organized by the types of products we offer and the partners we work with and are measured on interest and fees on loans loan receivables new accounts and other sales metrics see “ item 1 business—our sales platforms ”   

retail card 

retail card is a leading provider of private label credit cards and also provides dual cards general purpose cobranded credit cards and small and mediumsized business credit products we offer one or more of these products primarily through 26  national and regional retailers with which we have ongoing program agreements the average length of our relationship with these retail card partners is 19  years retail card’s revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned when our dual card or general purpose cobranded credit cards are used outside our partners sales channels and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products less loyalty program payments substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard terms 

payment solutions 

payment solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans at december 31 2016  payment solutions offered these products through participating partners consisting of national and regional retailers local merchants manufacturers buying groups and industry associations substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing payment solutions’ revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables including “merchant discounts” which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of foregone interest income associated with promotional financing 

carecredit 

carecredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for health and personal care procedures products or services at december 31 2016  we had a network of carecredit providers and healthfocused retailers that collectively have approximately 200000  locations the vast majority of which are individual or small groups of independent healthcare providers through which we offer a carecredit branded private label credit card substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing carecredit’s revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables including merchant discounts 

our credit products 

 

through our platforms we offer three principal types of credit products credit cards commercial credit products and consumer installment loans see “ item 1 business  our credit products ” 

credit cards 

we offer the following principal types of credit cards 

 commercial credit products 

we offer private label cards and dual cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings we also offer a commercial payinfull accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers we offer our commercial credit products primarily through our retail card platform to the commercial customers of our retail card partners 

installment loans 

in payment solutions we originate installment loans to consumers and a limited number of commercial customers in the united states primarily in the power products market motorcycles atvs and lawn and garden installment loans are closedend credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments installment loans are assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates 

business trends and conditions 

 

we believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions including the following 

 a total of 23  of our 26  retail card program agreements now have an expiration date in 2019 or beyond these 23  program agreements represented in the aggregate 99  of our retail card interest and fees on loans for the year ended december 31 2016  and 99  of our retail card loan receivables at december 31 2016  





seasonality 

 

in our retail card and payment solutions platforms we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down 

the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations delinquency metrics and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods these fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year 

in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net chargeoff rates in the first and second quarters our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net chargeoff rates in the third and fourth quarters because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in chargeoffs as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end consistent with this historical experience we generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period as compared to the end of a calendar year in addition despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end reflecting these same seasonal trends

the following table sets forth information for the periods indicated regarding average balance sheet data which are used in the discussion of interest income interest expense and net interest income that follows 

 



 the following table sets forth the amount of changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in average volume and average yieldrate variances due to changes in both average volume and average yieldrate have been allocated between the average volume and average yieldrate variances on a consistent basis based upon the respective percentage changes in average volume and average yieldrate 



interest income 

interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans which includes merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities we include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over a oneyear period and recorded in interest and fees on loans for noncredit card receivables direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans 

we analyze interest income as a function of two principal components average interestearning assets and yield on average interestearning assets key drivers of average interestearning assets include 

 key drivers of yield on average interestearning assets include 

 interest income increased by 1550 million  or 117  for the year ended   december 31 2016  and by 986 million or 81 for the year ended december 31 2015 these increases were driven primarily by growth in our average loan receivables 

average interestearning assets   



  

the increase in average loan receivables of 113  for the year ended   december 31 2016  was driven primarily by higher purchase volume of 104  average active accounts increased 68  to 669 million  for the year ended   december 31 2016  and the average balances per these active accounts increased 42  

the increase in average loan receivables for the year ended   december 31 2015  was driven primarily by higher purchase volume of 101 as a result of average active account growth and higher purchase volume per account average active accounts increased 44 to 626 million  for the year ended december 31 2015 from 600 million  for the year ended december 31 2014 

yield on average interestearning assets   

the yield on interestearning assets increased for the year ended   december 31 2016  primarily due to an increase in the percentage of interestearning assets attributable to loan receivables the yield on our average loan receivables remained relatively flat at 2139  for the year ended   december 31 2016  as slightly lower payment rates were offset by growth in promotional balances 

the decrease in yield on interestearning assets for the year ended december 31 2015 was driven primarily by growth in our liquidity portfolio which is comprised primarily of cash and equivalents and obligations of the us treasury that mature in less than twelve months which results in a significantly lower yield than our loan receivables the yield on our average loan receivables decreased to 2138  for the year ended   december 31 2015  from 2139 for the year ended  december 31 2014 reflecting the impact of slightly higher payment rates from our customers and growth in promotional balances 

interest expense 

interest expense is incurred on our interestbearing liabilities which consisted of interestbearing deposit accounts borrowings of consolidated securitization entities senior unsecured notes and the bank term loan 

key drivers of interest expense include 

 interest expense increased by 113 million  or 100  for the year ended   december 31 2016  driven primarily by the growth in our deposit liabilities our cost of funds increased to 185  for the year ended   december 31 2016  compared to 183  for the year ended   december 31 2015  primarily due to higher shortterm benchmark rates 

interest expense increased by 213 million or 231 for the year ended december 31 2015 driven primarily by increases in average interestbearing liabilities of 7481 million or 137 and an increase of 14 basis points in our cost of funds arising from the changes in our funding mix our cost of funds increased to 183  for the year ended   december 31 2015  from 169 for the year ended  december 31 2014 

average interestbearing liabilities 



the increase in average interestbearing liabilities for the year ended december 31 2016  was driven primarily by growth in our direct deposits partially offset by the repayment of thirdparty debt and lower securitized financings 

the increase in average interestbearing liabilities for the year ended december 31 2015 was driven primarily by growth in our direct deposits and the issuance of thirdparty debt to replace our related party funding from gecc 

net interest income 

net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense 

net interest income increased by 1437  million or 119  for the year ended   december 31 2016  primarily driven by higher average loan receivables 

net interest income increased by 773 million or 68 for the year ended december 31 2015 driven by higher average loan receivables partially offset by increased interest expense driven by higher liquidity funding mix and growth 

retailer share arrangements 

most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold we also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements for example on our cobranded credit cards all of these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products although the retailer share arrangements vary by partner these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program based typically on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold the threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on among other things agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses and therefore increases in our actual expenses such as funding costs or operating expenses may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have increased in recent years both in absolute terms and as a proportion of interest income partially as a result of the growth of our receivables related to programs with retailer share arrangements and improvements in the credit performance of these receivables in addition we have made changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years that have contributed to the increase in payments to partners pursuant to retailer share arrangements 

we believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners’ interests with ours we also believe that changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have contributed to the increase in our retailer share arrangement payments will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease and mitigate the impact on our profitability in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements 

retailer share arrangements increased by 164  million or 60  for the year ended   december 31 2016  driven primarily by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements partially offset by higher provision for loan losses and loyalty costs associated with these programs 

retailer share arrangements increased by 163 million or 63 for the year ended december 31 2015 driven primarily by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements partially offset with increased other expense and loyalty costs associated with these programs 

provision for loan losses 

provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at each period end date provision for loan losses in each period is a function of net chargeoffs gross chargeoffs net of recoveries and the required level of the allowance for loan losses our process to determine our allowance for loan losses is based upon our estimate of the incurred loss period for each type of loss ie aged fraud deceased settlement other nonaged and bankruptcy see “ critical accounting estimates  allowance for loan losses” and note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our allowance for loan loss methodology 

provision for loan losses increased by 1034 million  or 350  for the year ended   december 31 2016  primarily due to a higher loan loss reserve build and receivables growth the reserve build resulted from increases in our future expected losses in the next twelve months which were primarily driven by the factors discussed in business trends and conditions  stable asset quality  above 

our allowance coverage ratio increased to 569  at december 31 2016  as compared to 512  at december 31 2015  reflecting the increase in forecasted losses inherent in our loan portfolio 

provision for loan losses increased by 35 million or 12 for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to portfolio growth partially offset by improving asset quality trends our allowance coverage ratio decreased to 512  at december 31 2015  as compared to 528 at december 31 2014 reflecting improvements in our asset quality trends 

other income 



interchange revenue   

we earn interchange fees on dual card and other cobranded credit card transactions outside of our partners’ sales channels based on a flat fee plus a percent of the purchase amount we also process general purpose card transactions for some payment solutions and carecredit partners as their acquiring bank for which we obtain an interchange fee growth in interchange revenue has been and is expected to continue to be driven primarily by growth in our dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card products 

interchange revenue increased by 97 million  or 192  for the year ended december 31 2016  and by 116 million or 298 for the year ended december 31 2015  driven by increases in purchase volume outside of our retail partners sales channels 

debt cancellation fees 

debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance in return we will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events we offer our debt cancellation product to our credit card customers online and on a limited basis by direct mail we no longer offer this product via phone calls to our customer service department 

debt cancellation fees increased by 13 million  or 52  for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily as a result of changes in marketing to our carecredit customers driving an increase in enrollment and billed balances debt cancellation fees decreased by 26 million or 95 for the year ended december 31 2015  due to the fact that we now only offer the product through our online channel resulting in fewer customers being enrolled in the product 

loyalty programs 

we operate a number of loyalty programs in our retail card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty these programs typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a preset spending level on their private label credit card dual card or general purpose cobranded credit card other programs provide cash back or rewards points which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards growth in loyalty program payments has been and is expected to continue to be driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs 

loyalty programs cost increased by 128 million  or 305  for the year ended december 31 2016  and by 138 million or 491 for the year ended december 31 2015 arising from the launch of new rewards programs with our partners and growth in purchase volume associated with existing loyalty programs 

other 

other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees and investment gainslosses 

other decreased by 30 million  or 526  for the year ended   december 31 2016  and decreased by 45 million or 441 for the year ended december 31 2015 the decrease in both years was primarily due to a pretax gain of 20 million associated with the sale of certain loan portfolios in 2015 and a larger gain recorded in connection with portfolio sales in 2014 

other expense 



employee costs 

employee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs 

employee costs increased by 165 million  or 158  for the year ended december 31 2016  and by 176 million or 203 for the year ended december 31 2015  primarily due to new employees added to support the continued growth of the business and replacement of certain services provided by ge and third parties 

professional fees   

professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees eg collection agencies and call centers legal accounting consulting and recruiting expenses 

professional fees decreased by 7 million  or 11  for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily due to a reduction in costs associated with the separation partially offset by business growth 

professional fees increased by 82 million or 146 for the year ended december 31 2015 these expense increases were due to business growth the separation and higher thirdparty costs related to the emv card rollout for active dual card accounts 

marketing and business development 

marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing and business development spend as well as amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions 

marketing and business development costs decreased by 10 million  or 23  for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily by redirecting marketing funds into our partners loyalty programs and reduced marketing on retail deposits 

marketing and business development costs decreased by 27 million or 59 for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to lower portfolio marketing investments and lower brand advertising 

information processing 

information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers credit card associations and software licensing agreements 

information processing costs increased by 41 million  or 138  for the year ended december 31 2016  and by 85 million or 401 for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to higher information technology investment and higher transaction volume 

other 

other primarily consists of postage fraud expense litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other corporate overhead items such as facilities leases and maintenance leased equipment and telephone charges postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing option fraud is driven primarily by the number of our active dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card accounts 

the “other” component decreased for the year ended december 31 2016 primarily driven by lower payments to ge due to the replacement of certain services that were previously provided to us under the transition services agreement as well as benefits from the rollout of emv cards 

the “other” component increased for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to investments in growth infrastructure build in preparation for separation from ge higher fraud expense and also included expenses related to the completion of the emv card rollout for active dual card accounts these increases were largely offset by the impact of corporate overhead allocations no longer being billed to us by ge following our ipo 

provision for income taxes 



we now file consolidated us federal and state income tax returns separate and apart from ge for periods up to and including the date of separation we were included in the consolidated us federal and state income tax returns of ge where applicable but also filed certain separate state and foreign income tax returns the tax provision is presented on a separate company basis as if we were a separate filer for tax purposes for all periods presented the effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in our consolidated and combined financial statements in the period in which they occur our current obligations for taxes are settled with the relevant tax authority or ge as applicable on an estimated basis and adjusted in later periods as appropriate and are reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements in the periods in which those settlements occur we recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws see “ critical accounting estimates—income taxes ” for a discussion of the significant judgments and estimates related to income taxes 

the effective tax rates for each of the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015 decreased slightly compared to the corresponding prior year period the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the discrete impact of a change in the effective state tax rate research and development credits and an additional tax benefit that is reimbursed to ge under the terms of the tssa the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to a reduction in certain nondeductible expenses and tax reserves for uncertain income tax positions partially offset by increases in current state tax rates and a nonrecurring tax expense incurred in the prior year related to an internal corporate reorganization in each year the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 primarily due to state income taxes 

platform analysis 

as discussed above under “ —our sales platforms ” we offer our products through three sales platforms retail card payment solutions and carecredit which management measures based on their revenuegenerating activities the following is a discussion of certain supplemental information for the year ended   december 31 2016  for each of our sales platforms

loan receivables increased by 8047 million  or 118  at december 31 2016  and by 7004 million or 114 at december 31 2015  primarily driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth 

our loan receivables portfolio had the following maturity distribution at december 31 2016  



 

 our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at december 31 2016  



impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings 

our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions principal forgiveness extensions or other actions which may cause the related loan to be classified as a troubled debt restructuring “tdr” and also be impaired we primarily use longterm 12 to 60 months modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve longterm collectability of the loans that are classified as tdrs the longterm program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan the longterm program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments we also make loan modifications for some customers who request financial assistance through external sources such as a consumer credit counseling agency program the loans that are modified typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal interest or fees the determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions meet the tdr criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances 

loans classified as tdrs are recorded at their present value with impairment measured as the difference between the loan balance and the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan our allowance for loan losses on tdrs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows 

interest income from loans accounted for as tdrs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans we accrue interest on credit card balances until the accounts are chargedoff in the period the accounts become 180 days past due the following table presents the amount of loan receivables that are not accruing interest loans that are 90 days or more pastdue and still accruing interest and earning tdrs for the periods presented 



 

 



delinquencies 

over30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of periodend loan receivables increased to 432  at december 31 2016  as compared to 406  at december 31 2015  and 414 at december 31 2014 the 26 basis point increase in 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by the factors discussed in business trends and conditions — stable asset quality  above the 8 basis point decrease in 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by general improvement in the us economy 

net chargeoffs 

net chargeoffs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible net of recovered amounts we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and thirdparty fraud losses from chargeoffs chargedoff and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while thirdparty fraud losses are included in other expense chargeoffs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses and subsequent recoveries of previously chargedoff amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses costs incurred to recover chargedoff loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our consolidated and combined statements of earnings 

the table below sets forth the ratio of net chargeoffs to average loan receivables including held for sale for the periods indicated 



allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses totaled 4344  million at december 31 2016  compared with 3497 million  at december 31 2015  representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables increased to 569  at december 31 2016  from 512  at december 31 2015  which reflects the increase in forecasted net chargeoffs over the next twelve months as well as lower pricing of recoveries 

the following tables provide changes in our allowance for loan losses for the periods presented 











 

 

funding liquidity and capital resources 

 

we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital our funding liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations our business growth our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments 

funding sources 

our primary funding sources include cash from operations deposits direct and brokered deposits securitized financings and thirdparty debt 

the following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated 

 

 deposits 

we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers “direct deposits” or through thirdparty brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers “brokered deposits” at december 31 2016  we had 379 billion  in direct deposits which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions and 142 billion  in deposits originated through brokerage firms including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to expand our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding 

our direct deposits include a range of fdicinsured deposit products including certificates of deposit iras money market accounts and savings accounts 

brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms we have relationships with 10  brokers that offer our deposits through their networks our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at december 31 2016  had a weighted average remaining life of 28  years these deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal 

our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to among other things the interest rates we pay and therefore we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates or interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits to mitigate these risks our funding strategy includes a range of deposit products and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources including securitized financings including our undrawn committed capacity and unsecured debt 

the following table summarizes certain information regarding our interestbearing deposits by type all of which constitute us deposits for the periods indicated 

our deposit liabilities provide funding with maturities ranging from one day to ten years at december 31 2016  the weighted average maturity of our interestbearing time deposits was 19  years 

the following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity at december 31 2016  



 

 securitized financings 

we have been engaged in the securitization of our credit card receivables since 1997 we access the assetbacked securitization market using the synchrony credit card master note trust “synct” through which we issue assetbacked securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits in addition we issue assetbacked securities in private transactions through the synchrony sales finance master trust “sft” during the second quarter of 2016 we repaid all of the remaining outstanding third party indebtedness issued by the synchrony receivables trust “srt” and during the fourth quarter of 2016 we terminated srt 

at december 31 2016  we had 32 billion  of outstanding private assetbacked securities and 92 billion  of outstanding public assetbacked securities in each case held by unrelated third parties 

the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors’ interests in securitized financings excluding debt premiums discounts and issuance costs at december 31 2016  

 

 we retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through i in the case of synct and sft subordinated retained interests in the receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series to provide credit enhancement for a particular series as well as a pari passu seller’s interest in each trust and ii subordinated classes of synct notes that we own 

all of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers referred to as early amortization events including events related to material breaches of representations warranties or covenants inability or failure of the bank to transfer loans to the trusts as required under the securitization documents failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents and certain insolvencyrelated events with respect to the related securitization depositor synchrony solely with respect to synct or the bank in addition an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series falls below zero following an early amortization event principal collections on the loans in our trusts are applied to repay principal of the assetbacked securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business the occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred no early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in synct or sft 

the following table summarizes for each of our trusts the threemonth rolling average excess spread at december 31 2016  



 



thirdparty debt 

senior unsecured notes 

the following table provides a summary of our outstanding senior unsecured notes at december 31 2016  

 

 at december 31 2016  the aggregate amount of outstanding senior unsecured notes was 78 billion  and the weighted average interest rate was 326  

bank term loan 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we prepaid 41 billion  representing all the remaining outstanding indebtedness under the bank term loan which had an initial maturity date of august 2019 

shortterm borrowings 

except as described above there were no material shortterm borrowings for the periods presented 

undrawn credit facilities   

at december 31 2016  we had an aggregate of 62 billion  of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under our two existing securitization programs 

in july 2016 we entered into a threeyear unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders which provides 05 billion  of committed capacity at december 31 2016  all of the committed capacity under this facility was undrawn subject to customary borrowing conditions 

other   

at december 31 2016  we had more than 250 billion  of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window 

covenants 

the indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants including covenants that restrict subject to certain exceptions synchrony’s ability to dispose of or incur liens on any of the voting stock of the bank or otherwise permit the bank to be merged consolidated leased or sold in a manner that results in the bank being less than 80  controlled by us 

if we do not satisfy any of these covenants discussed above the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december 31 2016  

our real estate leases also include various covenants but typically do not include financial covenants if we do not satisfy the covenants in the real estate leases the leases may be terminated and we may be liable for damage claims at december 31 2016  we were not in default under any of our credit facilities and had not received any notices of default under any of our real estate leases 

credit ratings 

our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of the company the bank and the ratings of our assetbacked securities 

our senior unsecured debt is rated bbb stable outlook by fitch and bbb stable outlook by sp in addition certain of the assetbacked securities issued by synct are rated by fitch sp andor moody’s a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

liquidity 

 

we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations fund asset growth satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions 

we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business which is the responsibility of our asset and liability management committee a subcommittee of our risk committee we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process we evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs 

we maintain a liquidity portfolio which at december 31 2016  had 136 billion  of liquid assets primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and shortterm obligations of the us treasury less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid compared to a 148 billion  of liquid assets at december 31 2015  the decrease in liquid assets was primarily due to the prepayment of the bank term loan partially offset by the increase in deposits 

as additional sources of liquidity at december 31 2016  we had an aggregate of 67 billion  of undrawn credit facilities subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under our existing securitization programs and an unsecured revolving credit facility and we had more than 250 billion  of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window 

as a general matter investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash the level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions 

we rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity however bank regulations contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the bank’s ability to pay dividends see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness ” and “ regulation—savings association regulation—dividends and stock repurchases ” 

capital 

 

our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our business meet regulatory requirements adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments within these constraints we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders 

our capital adequacy assessment also includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance we maintain a net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet and we include this asset when calculating our regulatory capital levels however for regulatory capital purposes deferred tax assets i are limited to the amount of taxes previously paid that a company could recover through loss carrybacks and ii 10 of the amount of our tier 1 capital at december 31 2016  no portion of our deferred tax asset was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes 

the bank is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and as of january 1 2017 synchrony is also required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the occs and the federal reserve boards stress test regulations the bank and synchrony are required to use stresstesting methodologies providing for results under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress in addition while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the federal reserve boards capital planning rule we prepared and submitted a capital plan to the federal reserve board in april 2016 and commenced such plan in the third quarter of 2016 

dividend and share repurchases 

during the year ended december 31 2016  we declared and paid cash dividends of 026 per share of common stock or  214  million the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the board and will depend on many factors including the financial condition earnings capital and liquidity requirements of us and the bank regulatory restrictions corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make repurchases of our stock for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on our and the bank’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock see “ risk factors—risks relating to regulation—synchrony is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends and repurchase its common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to synchrony which could limit synchronys ability to pay dividends repurchase its common stock or make payments on its indebtedness ” 

on july 7 2016 the company also approved a share repurchase program of up to 952 million for the four quarters ending june 30 2017 the company repurchased approximately 167 million shares of our common stock for 476 million at an average price of 2855 we made and expect to continue to make share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals 

regulatory capital requirements  synchrony financial 

as a savings and loan holding company we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios under the applicable us basel iii capital rules for more information see “ regulation—savings and loan holding company regulation ” 

for synchrony financial to be a wellcapitalized savings and loan holding company synchrony bank must be wellcapitalized and synchrony financial must not be subject to any written agreement order capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued by the federal reserve board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure as of december 31 2016 and 2015 synchrony financial met all the requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized 

the following table sets forth at december 31 2016  and 2015  the composition of our capital ratios for the company calculated under the basel iii regulatory capital standards respectively 



 

 the increase in our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was primarily due to the retention of a majority of our net earnings for the year ended december 31 2016  partially offset by an increase in riskweighted assets as well as dividends and repurchases of our outstanding common stock that were made in 2016 the increase in riskweighted assets was primarily due to growth in loan receivables 

nongaap measures 

the capital ratios presented above include common equity tier 1 capital cet1 as calculated under the us basel iii capital rules on a fully phasedin basis which is not currently required by our regulators to be disclosed and as such is considered to be a nongaap measure we believe that this capital ratio is a useful measure to investors because it is widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies although this ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the components of our cet1 capital ratio as calculated on a fully phasedin basis set forth above to the comparable gaap components at december 31 2016  and 2015  





 

 regulatory capital requirements  synchrony bank 

at december 31 2016  and 2015  the bank met all applicable requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized pursuant to occ regulations and for purposes of the federal deposit insurance act the following table sets forth the composition of the bank’s capital ratios calculated under the basel iii rules at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  



failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see “ risk factors—risks relating to regulation—failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us ” 

offbalance sheet arrangements and unfunded lending commitments 

 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantees of thirdparty obligations guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a thirdparty based on certain trigger events at december 31 2016  we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position related to any guarantees 

we extend credit primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards in the ordinary course of business see note 4  loan receivables and allowance for loan losses  to our consolidated and combined financial statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments 

contractual obligations 

 

in the normal course of business we enter into various contractual obligations that require future cash payments our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations at december 31 2016 are summarized below 

 



critical accounting estimates 

 

in preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties the critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for loan losses asset impairment income taxes and fair value measurements all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables future impairments of investment securities goodwill and intangible assets and the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities among other effects see note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated and combined financial statements which discusses the significant accounting policies related to these estimates 

allowance for loan losses 

losses on loan receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of probable losses takes into account our historical experience adjusted for current conditions with each product and customer type and our judgment concerning the probable effects of relevant observable data trends and market factors 

we evaluate each portfolio quarterly for credit card receivables our estimation process includes analysis of historical data and there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance our risk process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or on a portfolio basis as appropriate more specifically we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables we use other analyses to estimate losses incurred on nondelinquent accounts the considerations in these analyses include past performance risk management techniques applied to various accounts historical behavior of different account vintages current economic conditions recent trends in delinquencies bankruptcy filings account collection management policy changes account seasoning loan volume and amounts payment rates forecasting uncertainties and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for losses which compares this allowance for losses to projected net chargeoffs over the next 12 months in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance we do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis but instead estimate its allowance for credit card loan losses on a portfolio basis further experience is not available for new portfolios therefore while we are developing that experience we set loss allowances based on our experience with the most closely analogous products in our portfolio the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates 

asset impairment 

investments 

we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria for debt securities if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows for equity securities our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we do not amortize goodwill but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is defined under gaap as the operating segment or one level below that operating segment the component level if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management our operating segment consists of a single reporting unit based on the level at which management regularly reviews and measures the business operating results 

goodwill impairment risk is first assessed under fasb accounting standards update “asu” 201108 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment  by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors for our reporting unit if potential goodwill impairment risk exists that indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value we apply a twostep quantitative test the first step compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of our reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step is applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill is considered impaired and reduced to its implied fair value the qualitative assessment for each period presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements was performed without hindsight assuming only factors and market conditions existing as of those dates and resulted in no potential goodwill impairment risk for our reporting unit consequently goodwill was not deemed to be impaired for any of the periods presented 

definitelived intangible assets principally consist of customerrelated assets including contract acquisitions and purchased credit card relationships these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the evaluation compares the cash inflows expected to be generated from each intangible asset to its carrying value if cash flows attributable to the intangible asset are less than the carrying value the asset is considered impaired and written down to its estimated fair value no impairments of definitelived intangible assets have been recognized in the periods presented 

income taxes 

we are subject to income tax in the united states federal state and local as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate our provision for income tax expense is based on our income the statutory tax rates and other provisions of the tax laws applicable to us in each of these various jurisdictions these laws are complex and their application to our facts is at times open to interpretation the process of determining our consolidated income tax expense includes significant judgments and estimates including judgments regarding the interpretation of those laws our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities incorporate those judgments and estimates and reflect management’s best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities as well as the impact of tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks and are measured using the enacted income tax laws and rates that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are specific to the jurisdiction in which they arise and are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization of those assets is more likely than not in making decisions regarding our ability to realize tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income taxable income in carryback periods expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the implementation of available tax planning strategies these decisions rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and our short and longrange business forecasts to provide insight 

asc 740 income taxes  establishes the framework by which we determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to be maintained for uncertain income tax positions applying this framework we recognize the financial statement impact of uncertain income tax positions when we conclude that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits of a position that the position will be sustained upon examination in certain situations we establish a liability that represents the difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return and the amount of taxes recognized in our financial statements 

fair value measurements 

assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances primarily include loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost method and equity method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired 

assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs a fair value measurement is determined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued 

new accounting standards 

 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap when it becomes effective in july 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of this standard with a revised effective date for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 the scope of asu 201409 excludes interest and fee income on loans and as a result the majority of the companys revenue will not be affected by the asu we are still evaluating the impact that asu 201409 will have on our consolidated and combined financial statements and related disclosures the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective cumulative effect transition method we have not yet selected a transition method 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 financial instrumentscredit losses measurement of credit losses on financial instruments this asu replaces the existing incurred loss impairment guidance with a new impairment model known as the current expected credit loss cecl model which is based on expected credit losses the cecl model requires upon origination of a loan the recognition of all expected credit losses over the life of the loan based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts this standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 with early adoption permitted for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 the amendments in this standard will be recognized through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective while we are evaluating the effect that asu 201613 will have on our consolidated and combined financial statements and related disclosures this standard is expected to result in an increase to the company’s allowance for loan losses given the change to expected losses for the estimated life of the financial asset the extent of the increase will depend on the asset quality of the portfolio and economic conditions and forecasts at adoption 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates see “ item 1a risk factors—risks relating to our business—changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings funding and liquidity ” and “ —a reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets ” 

interest rate risk   

we borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease as some of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is generally the prime rate and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either libor or the federal funds rate the prime rate and the libor or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities 

competitive factors and future regulatory reform may limit or restrict our ability to raise interest rates on our loans in addition some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers if interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner our net interest income and margin could be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us our floating rate products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowances for loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity 

at december 31 2016  556  of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer with the remaining 444  at a floating interest rate we fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits assetbacked securities and unsecured debt to manage interest rate risk we seek to match the interest rate repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities historically we have not used interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk however we may choose to do so in the future to the extent we are unable to effectively match the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities our net earnings could be materially adversely affected 

we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our net interest income 

for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates over the 12month period from our reporting date we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period the sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously simultaneously and to the same degree 

our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity portfolio at december 31 2016  444  of our receivables were priced at a floating interest rate assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature or otherwise contractually reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12month period are considered to be rate sensitive the latter category includes certain loans that may be offered at belowmarket rates for an introductory period such as balance transfers and special promotional programs after which the loans will contractually reprice under standard terms in accordance with our normal marketbased pricing structure for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice ie assets are categorized as fixed or floating according to their underlying contractual terms for assets that have a fixed interest rate at the period end but which contractually will or are assumed to reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 

interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12month period thus liabilities that vary with changes in a marketbased index such as the federal funds rate or libor which will reset before the end of the 12month period or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a marketbased indexed rate prior to the end of the 12month period also are considered to be rate sensitive for these fixed rate liabilities net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 

assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december 31 2016  we estimate that net interest income over the following 12month period would increase by approximately 113 million  

limitations of market risk measures   

the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information internallydeveloped assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments other market inputs such as interest rates market prices and interest rate volatility are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures we regularly evaluate update and enhance these assumptions models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities 

there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates the sensitivity analysis provided above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet it does not attempt to estimate the effect of a more significant interest rate increase over a sustained period of time which as described in “ —interest rate risk ” above could adversely affect our net interest income in addition the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ from our projections which could cause our actual net interest income to differ from the above sensitivity analysis

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

under the direction of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures   as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act and based on such evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2016  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

no change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2016  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting 

 

the management of synchrony financial “the company” is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company as defined by exchange act rules 13a15 and 15d15 the companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the companys assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the companys receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate although any system of internal control can be compromised by human error or intentional circumvention of required procedures we believe our system provides reasonable assurance that financial transactions are recorded and reported properly providing an adequate basis for reliable financial statements 

the company’s management has used the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting is effective there are no material weaknesses in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that have been identified by the company’s management

retailer share arrangements 

most of our retail card program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractuallydefined threshold economic performance for the purposes of these arrangements is typically measured based on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses we may also provide additional economic benefits to our partners such as a signing bonus royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts all of these arrangements align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products

buying groups and industry associations

individuallybranded programs 

our individuallybranded programs are focused on specific industries where we create either companybranded or company and partnerbranded private label credit cards that are usable across all participating locations within the industryspecific network for example our carcareone program comprised of merchants selling automotive parts repair services and tires covers over 23000  locations across the united states and cards issued may be dual branded with carcareone and partners such as midas michelin tires or pep boys under the terms of these programs we establish merchant discounts applicable to each financing offer and in some cases the fees we charge partners for their membership in the network

during the year ended december 31 2015  we added the following new carecredit relationships 

 

our customers 

 

acquiring and marketing to retail card  payment solutions customers 

we work directly with our partners using their distribution network communication channels and customer interactions to market our products to their customers and potential customers we believe our presence at our partners’ points of sale and our ability to make credit decisions instantly for a customer that is already predisposed to make a purchase enables us to acquire new customer accounts at significantly lower costs than general purpose card issuers who typically market directly to consumers through mass mailings and advertising 

to acquire new customers we collaborate with our partners and leverage our marketing expertise to create marketing programs that promote our products for creditworthy customers frequently our partners market the availability of credit as part of and with little incremental cost to the advertising for their goods and services our marketing programs include marketing offers eg 10 off the customer’s first purchase and consumer communications that are delivered through a variety of channels including instore signage online advertising retailer website placement associate communication emails text messages direct mail campaigns advertising circulars and outside marketing via television radio and print we also employ our proprietary quickscreen and equickscreen acquisition methods to make targeted preapproved credit offers at the pointofsale both instore and online our quickscreen and equickscreen technology allows us to run customer information that we have obtained from our partners through our risk models in advance so that when these customers seek to make payment for goods and services at our partners instore or online point of sale we can make a credit offer instantly if appropriate based on our experience due to the personalized and immediate nature of the offer quickscreen and equickscreen significantly outperform traditional directtoconsumer preapproved channels such as direct mail or email in response rate and dollar spending 

acquiring and marketing to carecredit customers 

we market our products through our provider network by training our network providers on the advantages of carecredit products and by making marketing materials available for providers to use to promote the program and educate customers our training helps our providers learn to discuss payment options during the pretreatment consultation phase including the option to apply for a carecredit credit card and the offer of promotional credit according to a 2015 survey of our carecredit customers 49  indicated that they would have postponed or reduced the scope of treatment if financing was not offered by their provider consumers can apply for our carecredit products in the provider’s office or online via the web or mobile device 

we also market our products to potential and existing customers directly through our webbased partner locator which allows customers to search for healthcare service providers that accept the carecredit credit card by desired geography and provider type according to our records our carecredit partner locator averaged over 700000  hits per month during the year ended december 31 2015  we believe our partners recognize the locator as an important source of new customer acquisition 

customer relationship management crm  analytics 

after a customer obtains one of our products our marketing programs encourage card utilization by continuing to communicate our products’ value propositions such as depending on the program promotional financing offers cardholder events product discounts dollaroff certificates account holder sales reward points and offers new product announcements and previews and free or reduced cost gift wrapping alteration or delivery services through our partners’ distribution channels 

through our crm and data analytics teams we track cardholder responsiveness to our marketing programs and use this research to target marketing messages and promotional offers to cardholders based on their individual characteristics such as length of relationship and spending pattern for example if a cardholder responds positively to a coupon sent by text message we will tailor future marketing messages so that they are delivered by text message our ability to target marketing messages and promotions is enhanced for dual card programs because we receive collect and analyze data on instore and all other spending 

our extensive marketing activities targeted to existing customers have yielded high levels of reuse across both our payment solutions and carecredit sales platforms during the year ended december 31 2015 27  and 50  of purchase volume across our payment solutions platform and carecredit network respectively resulted from repeat use at one or more retailers or providers 

digital and mobile capabilities 

we continue to develop our digital capabilities to help drive an improved mobile and online experience for our customers our mobile applications deliver customized features including rewards retail offers and alerts we also have enhanced the digital capabilities of our online banking experience which among other things allows customers to access their accounts from any device 

we continue to expand the use of our credit cards within various mobile wallets in order to further enhance the user experience for our customers in 2015 as well as enabling our dual card products for use in mobile wallets we provided the capability to offer private label cards through apple pay and enabled the use of our payment solutions and carecredit cards in samsung pay 

loyalty programs 

the retail loyalty cards we manage typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a preset spending level on their private label credit card or dual card the merchandise discounts can be mailed to the cardholder accessed online or may be immediately redeemable at the partner’s store other programs provide cash back or reward points which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards these loyalty programs are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer while reinforcing the value of the card to the customer and strengthening customer loyalty in the future we intend to offer loyalty programs to customers that utilize noncredit payment types such as cash debit or check these multitender loyalty programs will allow our partners to market to an expanded customer base and allow us access to additional prospective cardholders 

commercial customers 

in addition to our efforts to acquire consumer cardholders we are increasing our focus on small to midsized commercial customers we offer these customers private label credit cards and dual cards that can be used at our retail card partners and are similar to our consumer offerings we are also increasing our focus on marketing our commercial payinfull accounts receivable product that supports a wide range of business customers 

our credit products 

 

we offer three principal types of credit products credit cards commercial credit products and consumer installment loans we also offer a debt cancellation product 

the following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer at december 31 2015  



credit cards 

our credit card products are loans we extend through openended revolving credit card accounts we offer two principal types of credit cards private label credit cards and dual cards 

private label credit cards 

private label credit cards are partnerbranded credit cards eg lowe’s or amazon or programbranded credit cards eg carcareone or carecredit that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network in addition in some cases cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances 

credit under a private label credit card typically is extended either on standard terms only which means accounts are assessed periodic interest charges using an agreed nonpromotional fixed andor variable interest rate or pursuant to a promotional financing offer involving deferred interest no interest or reduced interest during a set promotional period promotional periods typically range between six and 48 months but we may agree to longer terms with the partner in almost all cases we receive a merchant discount from our partners to compensate us for all or part of the cost of providing the promotional financing feature the terms of these promotions vary by partner but generally the longer the deferred interest reduced interest or interestfree period the greater the partner’s merchant discount some offers permit customers to pay for a purchase in equal monthly payments with no interest or at a reduced interest rate rather than deferring or delaying interest charges for our deferred interest product approximately 80  of customer transactions are typically paid off before interest is assessed 

in retail card credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only and in payment solutions and carecredit credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended pursuant to a promotional financing offer in carecredit standard rate financing generally applies to charges under 200 

we typically do not charge interchange or other fees to our partners when a customer uses a private label credit card to purchase our partners’ goods and services through our payment system 

most of our private label credit card business is in the united states for some of our partners who have locations in canada we also support the issuance and acceptance of private label credit cards at their locations in canada and from customers in canada 

dual cards 

our proprietary dual cards are general purpose credit cards that are cobranded with our partner’s own brand and may be used to make purchases of goods or services from our partner functioning as a private label credit card purchases from others wherever cards from those card networks are accepted functioning as a general purpose credit card or cash advance transactions we currently issue dual cards for use on the visa and mastercard networks and we currently have the ability to issue dual cards for use on the american express and discover networks 

we have been granted two us patents relating to the process by which our dual cards function as a private label credit card when used to make purchases from our partners and function as a general purpose credit card when used on the systems of other credit card associations 

credit extended under our dual cards typically is extended on standard terms only currently only retail card offers dual cards at december 31 2015  we offered dual cards through 16  of our 22  continuing retail card programs we expect to continue to increase the number of partner programs that offer dual cards and seek to increase the portion of our loan receivables attributable to dual cards 

charges using a dual card generate interchange income for us in connection with purchases made by cardholders other than instore or online from the partner 

we currently do not issue dual cards in canada 

terms and conditions 

as a general matter the financial terms and conditions governing our credit card products vary by program and product type and change over time although we seek to standardize the nonfinancial provisions consistently across all products the terms and conditions of our credit card products are governed by a cardholder agreement and applicable laws and regulations 

we assign each card account a credit limit when the account is initially opened thereafter we may increase or decrease individual credit limits from time to time at our discretion based primarily on our evaluation of the customer’s creditworthiness and ability to pay 

for the vast majority of accounts periodic interest charges are calculated using the daily balance method which results in daily compounding of periodic interest charges subject to at times a grace period on new purchases cash advances are not subject to a grace period and some credit card programs do not provide a grace period for promotional purchases in addition to periodic interest charges we may impose other charges and fees on credit card accounts including as applicable and provided in the cardholder agreement cash advance transaction fees and late fees where a customer has not paid at least the minimum payment due by the required due date 

typically each customer with an outstanding debit balance on his or her credit card account must make a minimum payment each month a customer may pay the total amount due at any time without penalty we also may enter into arrangements with delinquent customers to extend or otherwise change payment schedules and to waive interest charges andor fees 

commercial credit products

we have expanded and continue to expand our online direct banking operations to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities our online platform is highly scalable allowing us to expand without having to rely on a traditional “brick and mortar” branch network we expect the continued growth in our direct banking platform to come primarily from retail deposits 

we are growing our direct banking operations and believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the consumerdriven shift from branch banking to direct banking according to 2014 and 2015 american bankers association surveys the percentage of customers who prefer to do their banking via direct channels internet mail phone and mobile increased from 54  to 56  between 2014 and 2015 while those who prefer branch banking declined from 21  to 17  over the same period

credit risk management 

 

credit risk management is a critical component of our management and growth strategy credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from customer default when customers are unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to us our credit risk arising from consumer credit products is generally highly diversified across over 115 million  open accounts at december 31 2015  without significant individual exposures we manage credit risk primarily according to customer segments and product types 

customer account acquisition 

we have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and have developed varying credit decision guidelines for the different partners we originate credit accounts through several different channels including instore mail internet mobile telephone and preapproved solicitations in addition we have and may in the future acquire accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners 

regardless of the channel in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit we follow a series of credit risk and underwriting procedures in most cases when applications are made instore or by internet or mobile the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately we generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus the credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to calculate a credit score the risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio and product type we periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance and adjust the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage risk different scoring models may be used depending upon bureau type and account source 

we also apply additional application screens based on various inputs including credit bureau information to help identify potential fraud and prior bankruptcies before qualifying the application for approval we compare applicants’ names against the specially designated nationals list maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury “ofac” as well as screens that account for adherence to usa patriot act of 2001 the “patriot act” and credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 the “card act” requirements including ability to pay requirements 

we occasionally use preapproved account solicitations for certain programs potential applicants are prescreened using information provided by our partner or obtained from outside lists and qualified individuals receive a preapproved credit offer by mail or email 

acquired portfolio evaluation 

our risk management team evaluates each portfolio that we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our credit risk guidelines as part of this review we receive data on the thirdparty accounts and loans which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information in addition we benchmark potential portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks finally our risk management team must approve the acquisition taking into account the results of our risk assessment process once assets are migrated to our systems our account management protocols will apply immediately as described below under “ —customer account management ” “ —credit authorizations of individual transactions ” and “ —collections ” 

customer account management 

we regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts this ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customer’s performance with respect to its account with us as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer’s broader credit performance to monitor and control the quality of our loan portfolio including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active account on its monthly cycle date proprietary risk models together with the fico scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly are an integral part of our credit decisionmaking process depending on the duration of the customer’s account risk profile and other performance metrics the account may be subject to a range of account actions including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits 

credit authorizations of individual transactions 

once an account has been opened when a credit card is used to make a purchase instore at one of our partners’ locations or online pointofsale terminals or online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system which allows for realtime updating of accounts each potential sales transaction is passed through a transaction authorization system which takes into account a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved or declined and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted 

fraud investigation 

we provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings new account fraud and transactional fraud we have developed a proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customer’s established pattern our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers we also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud in 2015 we reissued all active dual card products visa and mastercards that were active at the time when the portfolio was reissued with new plastics that utilize embedded security chips emv chip cards with all of our retail partners

all monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts collections personnel generally initiate contact with customers within 30 days after any portion of their balance becomes past due the nature and the timing of the initial contact typically a personal call email text message or letter are determined by a review of the customer’s prior account activity and payment habits 

we reevaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques including internal collection activities and use of external vendors as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent we limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the transaction authorization processes the imposition of credit limits and criteriabased account suspension and revocation processes in certain situations we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules decrease interest rates andor waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us

as part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technologies we may either develop these capabilities internally or in partnership with thirdparty providers we rely on thirdparty providers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and in some cases architecture designed by us these relationships include first data for our credit card transaction processing and production and fis fiserv in 2016 for retail banking 

data security 

the protection and security of financial and personal information of our consumers is one of our highest priorities we have implemented a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards and provides an appropriate level of protection to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our companys and our customers information this includes protecting against any known or evolving threats to the security or integrity of customer records and information and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information 

our information security program is intelligenceled focused on continuously adapting to an evolving landscape of emerging threats and available technology through data gathering and evaluation of emerging threats from internal and external incidents and technology investment security controls are adjusted on a continuous basis we work directly with our partners on an ongoing basis to expand our intelligence ecosystem and facilitate awareness and communications of events outside of the company 

we have developed a security strategy and implemented multiple layers of controls embedded throughout our technology environment that establish multiple control points between threats and our assets our security program is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store process or have access to sensitive data and we require the same level of protection of such thirdparty service providers we evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls through ongoing assessment and measurement 

in addition we identify risks that may threaten customer information and perform a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms systems and applications used to provide our products and services we employ backup and disaster recovery procedures for all the systems that are used for storing processing and transferring customer information and we periodically test and validate our disaster recovery plans we are compliant with the payment card industry pci program 

in connection with the separation we have completed the migration of the majority of the transitional services relating to technology and business processes provided by ge the exit of these remaining services includes the migration of very limited portions of our technology operating environment as a standalone company our corporate infrastructure is more focused and simplified creating greater security and resiliency for our clients partners and customers 

competition 

 

our industry is highly competitive and is becoming more competitive we compete for relationships with partners in connection with retaining existing or establishing new consumer credit programs our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as alliance data american express capital one chase citibank td bank and wells fargo and to a lesser extent potential partners’ own inhouse financing capabilities we compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors including program financial and other terms underwriting standards marketing expertise service levels product and service offerings including incentive and loyalty programs technological capabilities and integration brand and reputation in addition some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting eg new account approval customer service and collections and other core banking responsibilities that we retain 

we also compete for customer usage of our products consumer credit provided and credit card payments made using our cards constitute only a small percentage of overall consumer credit provided and credit card payments in the united states consumers have numerous financing and payment options available to them as a form of payment our products compete with cash checks debit cards visa and mastercard credit cards as well as american express discover card other privatelabel card brands and to a certain extent prepaid cards we also compete with nontraditional providers such as paypal in the future we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies such as apple pay and square as well as a consortia of merchants that are expected to combine payment systems to reduce interchange and other costs eg currentc to the extent that our products are not accepted in or compatible with such technologies we may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry we compete for customers and their usage of our products and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances based on a number of factors including pricing interest rates and fees product offerings credit limits incentives including loyalty programs and customer service some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services including home and automobile loans debit cards and bank branch atm access which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs in addition some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are may have substantially greater resources than we do or may offer a broader range of products and services than we do moreover some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage 

in our retail deposits business we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other directbanking competitors we compete for deposits with traditional banks and in seeking to grow our directbanking business we compete with other banks that have directbanking models similar to ours such as ally financial american express capital one 360 ing discover nationwide sallie mae and united services automobile association “usaa competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to quickly and easily deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors 

intellectual property 

 

we use a variety of methods such as trademarks patents copyrights and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property including our new brand synchrony we also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures our brands are important assets and we take steps to protect the value of these assets and our reputation 

employees 

 

at december 31 2015  we had approximately 12000  full time employees none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we have not experienced any material employmentrelated work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good we also have relationships with thirdparty call center providers in the united states and other countries that provide us with additional contractors for customer service collections and other functions

liquidity 

as a savings and loan holding company with total consolidated assets in excess of 50 billion we are required to comply with the modified liquidity coverage ratio rule “modified lcr rule” approved by the federal reserve board in 2014 the modified lcr rule requires us to calculate on a monthly basis the ratio of the amount of our high quality liquid assets to our expected total net cash outflows over a 30day stress period “modified lcr ratio” and to maintain a modified lcr ratio above 10 the modified lcr rule is already in effect although its requirements are being phased in over a twoyear period ending january 1 2017 under rules proposed by the federal reserve board in 2015 we may also be required to disclose our modified lcr and other associated liquidity data on a quarterly basis commencing in 2018 

in addition to the modified lcr we may in the future be required to comply with rules adopted by the federal reserve board or other banking regulators to implement the basel iii net stable funding ratio “nsfr” which would require us to maintain a minimum acceptable amount of stable funding based on our liquidity characteristics the basel committee contemplates that the nsfr will be implemented as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 however the us federal banking regulators have not yet published a proposed rule to implement the nsfr in the united states 

finally the federal reserve board requires bank holding companies of a similar size to us to comply with certain enhanced prudential standards with respect to liquidity management among other things such bank holding companies must maintain diversified liquidity portfolios and must regularly conduct liquidity stress tests while as a savings and loan holding company we are not covered by the enhanced prudential standards we currently comply with many aspects of the liquidity management requirements in the enhanced prudential standards including the diversification and stress testing requirements

according to guidance from the federal reserve board our dividend policies will be assessed against among other things our ability to achieve applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements if we do not achieve applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements when they are fully phasedin we may not be able to pay dividends although we currently expect to meet the applicable final basel iii capital ratio requirements inclusive of any applicable capital conservation buffer when they are fully phased in by the federal reserve board we cannot be sure that we will meet those requirements or even if we do if we will be able to pay dividends 

we also will be required to inform and consult with the federal reserve board in advance of redeeming or repurchasing our stock if the result will be a net reduction in our equity compared to our equity as of the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs in evaluating the appropriateness of a proposed redemption or repurchase of stock the federal reserve board will consider among other things the potential loss that we may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets as a result of continued asset deterioration and our ability to raise additional common equity and other capital to replace the stock that will be redeemed or repurchased the federal reserve board also will consider the potential negative effects on our capital structure of replacing common stock with any lowertier form of regulatory capital issued moreover the approval process for any capital plan we are required to submit could result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions see “ item 1a   risk factorsrisks relating to regulationfailure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us ” and “ —we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends or make payments on our indebtedness ”

the cra is a federal law that generally requires an insured depository institution to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments offer products and provide services in each case designed to meet the credit needs of these communities the cra also requires an institution to maintain comprehensive records of cra activities to demonstrate how it is meeting the credit needs of communities these records are subject to periodic examination by the responsible federal banking agency of the institution based on these examinations the agency rates the institution’s compliance with cra as “outstanding” “satisfactory” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance” the cra requires the agency to take into account the record of an institution in meeting the credit needs of the entire communities served including low and moderate income neighborhoods in determining such rating failure of an institution to receive at least a “satisfactory” rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities including acquisitions the bank received a cra rating of “outstanding” as of its most recent cra examination 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates there are no such restrictions under the fdia on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” further “undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations at december 31 2015  the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized for purposes of the fdia an inability to accept brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity 

in connection with the occ’s december 12 2012 approval of the bank’s assumption of certain deposits and related liabilities of metlife and acquisition of certain assets of metlife the bank entered into an operating agreement with the occ the “operating agreement” and also into a capital assurance and liquidity maintenance agreement with general electric capital corporation “gecc” ge consumer finance inc “gecfi” and synchrony the “calma” on january 11 2013 the occ terminated the operating agreement in writing on february 4 2016 at which time the calma also terminated the obligations of gecc and gecfi under the calma terminated upon the consummation of the exchange offer the material terms of the operating agreement and the calma are summarized below and the operating agreement and the calma have been filed as exhibits to this report 

the operating agreement required among other things that the bank i maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 110  a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 70  and a leverage ratio of at least 60  ii maintain liquid assets at least equal to the greater of 500 million  or 90 days’ coverage of the bank’s operating expenses iii not materially change or significantly deviate from a business plan for 2013 and 2014 that was submitted to the occ without first giving the occ notice and obtaining its supervisory nonobjection iv meet certain conditions to declare or pay a dividend including being in compliance with the operating agreement v maintain a board with at least 40  independent directors and vi for three years immediately after the date of the operating agreement not appoint any new director or senior executive officer or enter into a material services contract with an affiliate without providing prior notice to the occ 

the operating agreement provided that if the occ determined there was an existing or imminent material breach of the bank’s obligation to maintain the required amounts of capital or liquidity or synchrony was likely to be unable to fulfill its obligations under the calma due to a material adverse change in the financial condition of synchrony or in certain other circumstances the bank would have been required to submit to the occ a plan for the sale merger or dissolution of the bank and implement such plan upon obtaining the occ’s nonobjection and written direction to begin implementation subject to a right on the bank’s part to cure the basis for such direction within 15 days of its issuance the operating agreement also provided that the occ may have required the bank to immediately cease extending new or additional credit under certain circumstances including if i the occ determined there is an existing or imminent material breach of the bank’s obligation to maintain the required amounts of capital or liquidity or synchrony was likely to be unable to fulfill its obligations under the calma due to a material adverse change in the financial condition of synchrony ii the occ deemed that breach or change likely to pose an imminent threat to the financial condition of the bank and iii such breach or change had not been cured or remedied as the case may be within five days of receiving written notice from the occ the operating agreement imposed certain monitoring and reporting obligations including among other things notification to the occ regarding material changes to the financial condition of the bank and synchrony 

the calma required among other things that synchrony i make capital infusions as requested by the bank to ensure that the bank remains in compliance with the capital requirements of the operating agreement ii provide such financial support as requested by the bank to ensure that the bank remains in compliance with the liquidity requirements of the operating agreement and iii provide certain information to the bank and the occ relevant to its financial condition and ability to fulfill its obligations under the calma 

deposit insurance 

the fdia requires the bank to pay deposit insurance assessments deposit insurance assessments are affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the federal deposit insurance fund the “dif” the doddfrank act increased the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the dif to 135  and removed the statutory cap on the reserve ratio the fdic subsequently set a reserve ratio of 2  and may increase that ratio in the future under the fdic’s current deposit insurance assessment methodology the bank is required to pay deposit insurance assessments based on its average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity and various other regulatory factors included in an fdic assessment scorecard 

the fdia creates a depositor preference regime for the resolution of all insured depository institutions including the bank if any such institution is placed into receivership the fdic will pay out of the remaining net assets of the failed institution and only to the extent of such assets first secured creditors to the extent of their security second the administrative expenses of the receivership third all deposits liabilities both insured and uninsured fourth any other general or senior liabilities fifth any obligations subordinated to depositors or general creditors and finally any remaining net assets to shareholders in that capacity 

resolution and recovery planning 

the bank is required annually to submit to the fdic a plan for the bank’s resolution in the event of its failure the plan is designed to enable the fdic if appointed receiver for the bank to resolve the bank under sections 11 and 13 of the fdia in a manner that ensures that its depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the banks failure two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than friday maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of the bank’s assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution the resolution and recovery plan requirement is intended to ensure that the fdic has access to all of the material information it needs to resolve the bank efficiently in the event of its failure 

heightened standards for risk management governance 

the occ’s heightened standards establish guidelines for the governance and risk management practices of large occregulated institutions including the bank these heightened standards require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risktaking activities provide standards for covered banks’ boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework and describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units independent risk management and internal audit functions the bank will be required to comply with the heightened standards beginning in may 2016 

consumer financial services regulation 

the relationship between us and our us customers is regulated under federal and state consumer protection laws federal laws include the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act hola the fair credit reporting act the “fcra” the grammleachbliley act the “glba” the card act and the doddfrank act these and other federal laws among other things require disclosures of the cost of credit provide substantive consumer rights prohibit discrimination in credit transactions regulate the use of credit report information provide financial privacy protections require safe and sound banking operations prohibit unfair deceptive and abusive practices restrict our ability to raise interest rates and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight state and in some cases local laws also may regulate the relationship between us and our us customers in these areas as well as in the areas of collection practices and may provide other additional consumer protections moreover we and our us subsidiaries are subject to the servicemembers civil relief act which protects persons called to active military service and their dependents from undue hardship resulting from their military service the servicemembers civil relief act applies to all debts incurred prior to the commencement of active duty including credit card and other openend debt and limits the amount of interest including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges other than bona fide insurance that is related to the obligation or liability 

violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers including actual damages restitution and attorneys’ fees federal banking regulators as well as state attorneys general and other state and local consumer protection agencies also may seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies including civil money penalties and fines 

the card act was enacted in 2009 and most of the requirements became effective in 2010 the card act made numerous amendments to the truth in lending act requiring us to make significant changes to many of our business practices including marketing underwriting pricing and billing the card act’s restrictions on our ability to increase interest rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and credit risk ultimately limits our ability to extend credit to new customers and provide additional credit to current customers other card act restrictions such as limitations on late fees have resulted and will continue to result in reduced interest income and loan fee income 

the fcra regulates the bank’s and our use of credit reports and the reporting of information to credit reporting agencies and also provides a standard for lenders to share information with affiliates and certain third parties and to provide firm offers of credit to consumers the fcra also places further restrictions on the use of information shared between affiliates for marketing purposes requires the provision of disclosures to consumers when riskbased pricing is used in a credit decision and requires safeguards to help protect consumers from identity theft 

under hola the bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers in general the bank may not extend credit lease or sell property or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that i the customer obtain or provide some additional credit property or services from or to the bank or synchrony or their subsidiaries or ii the customer may not obtain some other credit property or services from a competitor except in each case to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended certain arrangements are permissible for example the bank may offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products 

the durbin amendment in the doddfrank act requires the federal reserve board to promulgate certain rules related to debit transaction interchange fees on june 29 2011 the federal reserve board adopted a final rule with respect to the durbin amendment effective on october 1 2011 which among other things established a regulatory cap for many types of debit interchange transactions that is no more than 21 cents plus five basis points of the value of the transaction the federal reserve board’s rule also allows a debit card issuer to recover 1  per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraudrelated requirements in addition the rule prohibits the imposition of restrictions on a merchant’s ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over a network for which the issuer has enabled processing 

the doddfrank act established the cfpb which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair transparent and competitive the cfpb has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the doddfrank act and other federal consumer financial services laws as well as broad supervisory examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services such as us in addition the cfpb has an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the products we offer the system could inform future agency decisions with respect to regulatory enforcement or examination focus there continues to be uncertainty as to how the cfpb’s strategies and priorities will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureau’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business ” 

on december 10 2013 we entered into a consent order with the cfpb relating to our carecredit platform the “2013 cfpb consent order” which required us to pay up to 341 million  to customers to provide additional training and monitoring of our carecredit enrolled network providers to include provisions in agreements with our carecredit enrolled network providers prohibiting charges for certain services not yet rendered to make changes to certain consumer disclosures application procedures and procedures for resolution of customer complaints and to terminate carecredit enrolled network providers that have chargeback rates in excess of certain thresholds some of the changes required by the 2013 cfpb consent order are similar to requirements in an assurance of discontinuation that we entered with the attorney general for the state of new york on june 3 2013 the “assurance” we believe the bank to be in compliance with the material business practice changes required by the 2013 cfpb consent order and the assurance subject to ongoing reporting chargeback monitoring and biannual enrolled network provider retraining obligations we will continue to actively monitor and access the impact of these changes on our carecredit program in addition to the costs of remediation which were not material for the assurance and were 341 million  for the 2013 cfpb consent order the company will incur an estimated ongoing annual cost of approximately 2 million  although at this time we do not believe that the 2013 cfpb consent order and the assurance will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations going forward we may elect or be required to make changes with respect to these and other deferred interest products in the future and those changes may adversely affect customers’ use of our credit cards or our business see “ item 1a risk factors—risks relating to regulation—changes to our methods of offering our carecredit products could materially impact operating results ” 

on june 19 2014 we entered into a consent order with the cfpb the “2014 cfpb consent order” that required us to refund 56 million  to cardholders who enrolled in a debt cancellation product over the telephone from january 2010 to october 2012  11 million  of which was refunded prior to the 2014 cfpb consent order pay civil money penalties of 35 million  and implement a compliance plan related to the sale of “addon” products to the extent the bank restarts telesales of such products which were discontinued in october 2012 in the second quarter of 2015 we completed the consumer refunds 

in addition to resolving the cfpb’s concerns regarding our debt cancellation sales practices the 2014 cfpb consent order resolved an unrelated issue that arose from the bank’s selfidentified omission of certain spanishspeaking customers and customers residing in puerto rico from two offers that were made to certain delinquent customers we discovered this issue through an audit of our collection operations in 2012 reported it to the cfpb and initiated a voluntary remediation program which resulted in payments balance credits and balance waivers of 132 million  the cfpb conducted a review of the collection offer omissions and also referred the matter to the doj which commenced an investigation in march 2014 at the same time we entered into the 2014 cfpb consent order we entered into a consent order with the doj the “2014 doj consent order” and together with the 2014 cfpb consent order the “2014 consent orders” to settle a complaint filed by the doj on june 19 2014 in the united states district court for the district of utah that made similar allegations to those alleged in the 2014 cfpb consent order the 2014 doj consent order was approved by the court on june 26 2014 the 2014 doj consent order is similar to the 2014 cfpb consent order and did not impose any additional requirements on us the 2014 consent orders required us to complete our remediation program by providing additional payments balance credits and balance waivers and to update our credit bureau reporting relating to the affected accounts in the third quarter of 2015 we completed our consumer remediation program which consisted of approximately 185 million of balance credits and waivers to previously chargedoff accounts and approximately 15 million of other credits or payments this remediation program included the 132 million of voluntary remediation completed prior to the 2014 consent orders in addition to consumer remediation the 2014 consent orders required us to implement a fair lending compliance plan including fair lending reviews audits and training which will in part be satisfied by our existing compliance processes on january 25 2016 the doj filed a notice with the court that the 2014 doj consent order had terminated pursuant to its terms although we do not believe that the 2014 consent orders themselves will have a material adverse effect on results of operations going forward we cannot be sure whether the settlement will have an adverse impact on our reputation or whether any similar actions will be brought by state attorneys general or others all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

in december 2015 the cfpb published its second biennial report reviewing the consumer credit card market in the report the cfpb identified areas of concern for consumers including deferred interest products subprime specialist credit card issuers and unexpected rate increases with respect to variable interest rate products in addition the report analyzed issues regarding debt sales and debt collection practices the adequacy and availability of online disclosures as well as of the disclosures associated with rewards products and grace periods separately in march 2015 the cfpb issued a report scrutinizing predispute arbitration clauses and in october 2015 the cfpb published proposals that would require any arbitration agreement included in a contract for a consumer financial product or service to provide explicitly that the arbitration agreement is inapplicable to cases filed in court on behalf of a class unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed if the cfpb’s proposals are enacted we expect that our exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to our business—litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses ” 

privacy 

we along with the bank are subject to various privacy information security and data protection laws including requirements concerning security breach notification for example in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the glba and implementing regulations and guidance among other things the glba i imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties ii requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties with certain exceptions and iii requires financial institutions to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches federal and state laws also require us to respond appropriately to data security breaches we along with the bank have a program to comply with applicable privacy information security and data protection requirements imposed by federal state and foreign laws including the glba see also “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—regulations relating to privacy information security and data protection could increase our costs affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities ” 

money laundering and terrorist financing prevention program 

we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act and the usa patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale these controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments the program is coordinated by a compliance officer undergoes an annual independent audit to assess its effectiveness and requires training of employees see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—failure to comply with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us ” 

sanctions programs 

we have a program designed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs including those administered and enforced by ofac these sanctions are usually targeted against foreign countries terrorists international narcotics traffickers and those believed to be involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction these regulations generally require either the blocking of accounts or other property of specified entities or individuals but they may also require the rejection of certain transactions involving specified entities or individuals we maintain policies procedures and other internal controls designed to comply with these sanctions programs 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in “ cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements ” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in “ item 8 financial statements and supplementary data ” of this form 10k report 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we anticipate discussion about important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in the business descriptions in “ item 1 business ” and the mda section of this form 10k report below we describe certain important strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will affect our future results 

risks relating to our businesses 

 

macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

key macroeconomic conditions historically have affected our business results of operations and financial condition and are likely to affect them in the future consumer confidence unemployment and housing indicators are among the factors that often impact consumer spending behavior poor economic conditions reduce the usage of our credit cards and other financing products and the average purchase amount of transactions on our credit cards and through our other products which in each case reduces our interest and fee income we rely primarily on interest and fee income to generate our net earnings our interest and fee income was 132 billion  for the year ended december 31 2015  poor economic conditions also adversely affect the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us increasing delinquencies bankruptcies chargeoffs and allowances for loan losses and decreasing recoveries for example our over30 day delinquency rate as a percentage of periodend loan receivables was 825  at december 31 2009 during the financial crisis compared to 406  at december 31 2015  and our fullyear net chargeoff rate was 1126  for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 433  for the year ended december 31 2015  we believe the delinquency rate in our portfolio is at historically low levels and chargeoff rates in our portfolio are back to prerecession levels and they both may increase and are likely to increase materially if economic conditions deteriorate 

while certain economic conditions in the united states have shown signs of improvement economic growth has been slow and uneven as consumers continue to recover from previously high unemployment rates lower housing values concerns about the level of us government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address this as well as economic and political conditions in the global markets a prolonged period of slow economic growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions would likely affect consumer spending levels and the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

macroeconomic conditions may also cause net earnings to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of securities analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding the impact of these conditions on our business and this may adversely impact our stock price 

our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners 

substantially all of our revenue is generated from the credit products we provide to customers of our partners pursuant to program agreements we enter into with our partners as a result our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners historically there has been turnover in our partners and we expect this will continue in the future for example during the year ended december 31 2015 we sold certain credit card portfolios associated with retail partners whose program agreements with us were not extended beyond their contractual expiration dates 

program agreements with our retail card partners and national and regional retailer and manufacturer payment solutions partners typically are for multiyear terms these program agreements generally permit our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons including in some cases if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria we fail to achieve certain targets with respect to approvals of new customers as a result of the credit criteria we use we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds or we are not adequately capitalized or certain force majeure events or changes in our ownership occur or a material adverse change in our financial condition occurs a few payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer and manufacturer partners also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us eg several months in addition programs with manufacturers buying groups and industry associations generally are made available to payment solutions partners such as individual retail outlets dealers and merchants under dealer agreements which typically may be terminated at will by the partner on short notice to us eg 15 days 

there is significant competition for our existing partners and our failure to retain our existing larger partner relationships upon the expiration or our earlier loss of a relationship upon the exercise of a partner’s early termination rights or the expiration or termination of a substantial number of smaller partner relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including growth rates and financial condition to the extent we do not acquire new partners of similar size and profitability or otherwise grow our business the competition for new partners is also significant and our failure to attract new partners could adversely affect our ability to grow 

a significant percentage of our platform revenue comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our five largest programs gap jcpenney lowe’s sam’s club and walmart accounted in aggregate for 49  of our total platform revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  and 51  of loan receivables at december 31 2015  our programs with jcpenney and walmart each accounted for more than 10 of our total platform revenue and jcpenney lowes and walmart each accounted for more than 10 of our total platform interest and fees and other income in each case for the year ended december 31 2015 sam’s club is a subsidiary of walmart that is a separate contracting entity with its own program agreement with us which we report separately from the walmart program we expect to have significant concentration in our largest relationships for the foreseeable future see  item 1 business—retail card partners  

the program agreements generally permit us or our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date under various circumstances as described in the preceding risk factor some of our program agreements also provide that upon expiration or termination our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loans generated with respect to its program and all related customer data the loss of any of our largest partners or a material reduction in the interest and fees we receive from their customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results depend to a significant extent on the active and effective promotion and support of our products by our partners 

our partners generally accept most major credit cards and various other forms of payment and therefore our success depends on their active and effective promotion of our products to their customers we depend on our partners to integrate the use of our credit products into their store culture by training their sales associates about our products having their sales associates encourage their customers to apply for and use our products and otherwise effectively marketing our products in addition although our retail card programs and our payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer partners typically are exclusive with respect to the credit products we offer at that partner some payment solutions programs and most carecredit provider relationships are not exclusive to us and therefore a partner may choose to promote a competitor’s financing over ours depending upon cost availability or attractiveness to consumers or other factors typically we do not have or utilize any recourse against these nonexclusive partners when they do not sufficiently promote our products partners may also implement or fail to implement changes in their systems and technologies that may disrupt the integration between their systems and technologies and ours which could disrupt the use of our products the failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as changes they may make in their business models that negatively impact card usage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition if our partners engage in improper business practices do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements or other contractual arrangements or standards or otherwise diminish the value of our brand we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our results are impacted to a significant extent by the financial performance of our partners 

our ability to generate new loans and the interest and fees and other income associated with them is dependent upon sales of merchandise and services by our partners the retail and healthcare industries in which our partners operate are intensely competitive our partners compete with retailers and department stores in their own geographic areas as well as catalog and internet sales businesses our partners in the healthcare industry compete with other healthcare providers our partners’ sales may decrease or may not increase as we anticipate for various reasons some of which are in the partners’ control and some of which are not for example partner sales may be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions having a national regional or more local effect on consumer spending business conditions affecting a particular partner or industry or catastrophes affecting broad or more discrete geographic areas if our partners’ sales decline for any reason it generally results in lower credit sales and therefore lower loan volume and associated interest and fees and other income for us from their customers in addition if a partner closes some or all of its stores or becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding or if there is a perception that it may become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding its customers who have used our financing products may have less incentive to pay their outstanding balances to us which could result in higher chargeoff rates than anticipated and our costs for servicing its customers’ accounts may increase this risk is particularly acute with respect to our largest partners that account for a significant amount of our platform revenue see “ —a significant percentage of our platform revenue comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations ” moreover if the financial condition of a partner deteriorates significantly or a partner becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding we may not be able to recover for customer returns customer payments made in partner stores or other amounts due to us from the partner a decrease in sales by our partners for any reason or a bankruptcy proceeding involving any of them could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

adverse financial market conditions or our inability to effectively manage our funding and liquidity risk could have a material adverse effect on our funding liquidity and ability to meet our obligations 

we need to effectively manage our funding and liquidity in order to meet our cash requirements such as daytoday operating expenses extensions of credit to our customers payments of principal and interest on our borrowings and payments on our other obligations our primary sources of funding and liquidity are collections from our customers deposits funds from securitized financings and proceeds from unsecured borrowings if we do not have sufficient liquidity we may not be able to meet our obligations particularly during a liquidity stress event if we maintain or are required to maintain too much liquidity it could be costly and reduce our financial flexibility 

we will need additional financing in the future to refinance any existing debt and finance growth of our business the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as financial market conditions generally including the availability of credit to the financial services industry consumers’ willingness to place money on deposit in the bank our performance and credit ratings and the performance of our securitized portfolios disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital credit or deposit markets such as the uncertainty and volatility experienced in the capital and credit markets during the financial crisis and more recently arising from the sovereign debt crisis in europe and other economic and political conditions in the global markets and concerning the level of us government debt and fiscal measures that may be taken over the longer term to address these matters may limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance maturing liabilities on desired terms including funding costs in a timely manner or at all as a result we may be forced to delay obtaining funding or be forced to issue or raise funding on undesirable terms which could significantly reduce our financial flexibility and cause us to contract or not grow our business all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions 

in addition at december 31 2015 we had an aggregate of 61 billion  of undrawn committed capacity from private lenders under two of our existing securitization programs our ability to draw on such commitments is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including the applicable securitization trust having sufficient collateral to support the draw and the absence of an early amortization event moreover there are regulatory reforms that have recently been proposed or adopted in the united states and internationally that are intended to address certain issues that affected banks in the recent financial crisis these reforms generally referred to as “basel iii” subject banks to more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements to the extent that the basel iii requirements result in increased costs to the banks providing undrawn committed capacity under our securitization programs these costs are likely to be passed on to us in addition in response to basel iii some banks in the market including certain of the private lenders in our securitization programs have added provisions to their credit agreements permitting them to delay disbursement of funding requests for 30 days or more if our bank lenders require delayed disbursements of funding andor higher pricing for committing undrawn capacity to us our cost of funding and access to liquidity could be adversely affected 

while financial market conditions have generally stabilized and improved since the financial crisis there can be no assurance that significant disruptions uncertainties and volatility will not occur in the future if we are unable to continue to finance our business access capital markets and attract deposits on favorable terms and in a timely manner or if we experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

a reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

our senior unsecured debt currently is rated bbb stable outlook by fitch ratings inc “fitch” and bbb stable outlook by standard  poor’s “sp” although we have not requested that moody’s investor services inc “moody’s” provide a rating for our senior unsecured debt we believe that if moody’s were to issue a rating on our unsecured debt its rating would be lower than the comparable ratings issued by fitch and sp the ratings for our unsecured debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors that may not be within our control such as macroeconomic conditions and the rating agencies’ perception of the industries in which we operate and the products we offer the ratings of our assetbacked securities are and will continue to be based on a number of factors including the quality of the underlying loans and the credit enhancement structure with respect to each series of assetbacked securities as well as our credit rating as sponsor and servicer of our publicly registered securitization trust these ratings also reflect the various methodologies and assumptions used by the rating agencies which are subject to change and could adversely affect our ratings the rating agencies regularly evaluate our credit ratings as well as the credit ratings of our assetbacked securities a downgrade in our unsecured debt or assetbacked securities credit ratings or investor concerns that a downgrade may occur could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

if the ratings on our assetbacked securities are reduced put on negative watch or withdrawn it may have an adverse effect on the liquidity or the market price of our assetbacked securities and on the cost of or our ability to continue using securitized financings to the extent anticipated 

our inability to securitize our loans would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition 

we use the securitization of loans which involves the transfer of loans to a trust and the issuance by the trust of assetbacked securities to thirdparty investors as a significant source of funding our average level of securitized financings from third parties was 139 billion  and 148 billion  for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively for a discussion of our securitization activities see “ item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—funding liquidity and capital resources—funding sources—securitized financings ” and note 5 variable interest entities  to our consolidated and combined financial statements 

although the securitization market for credit cards has been reestablished since the financial crisis that began in 2008 there can be no assurance that the market will not experience future disruptions the extent to which we securitize our loans in the future will depend in part upon the conditions in the securities markets in general and the credit card assetbacked securities market in particular the overall credit quality of our loans and the conformity of the loans and our securitization program to rating agency requirements the costs of securitizing our loans and the legal regulatory accounting and tax requirements governing securitization transactions in the event we are unable to refinance existing assetbacked securities from our publicly registered securitization trust with new securities from the same trust there are structural and regulatory constraints on our ability to refinance these assetbacked securities with bank deposits or other funding at the bank and therefore we would be required to rely on sources outside of the bank which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost a prolonged inability to securitize our loans on favorable terms or at all or to refinance our assetbacked securities would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition 

the occurrence of an early amortization of our securitization facilities would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds 

our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events resulting in the early amortization of our existing securitized financings during an early amortization period principal collections from the loans in our assetbacked securitization trusts would be applied to repay principal of the assetbacked securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund purchases of newly originated loans this would negatively impact our liquidity including our ability to originate new loans under existing accounts and require us to rely on alternative funding sources which might increase our funding costs or might not be available when needed 

our loss of the right to service or subservice our securitized loans would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds 

synchrony currently acts as servicer with respect to our publicly registered securitization trust and its related series of assetbacked securities and the bank acts as servicer with respect to our other two securitization trusts if synchrony or the bank as applicable defaults in its servicing obligations an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant assetbacked securities andor synchrony or the bank as applicable could be replaced as servicer servicer defaults include for example the failure of the servicer to make any payment transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents a breach of representations warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents the delegation of the servicer’s duties contrary to the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer such an amortization event would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor 

if either synchrony or the bank defaults in its servicing obligations with respect to any of our three securitization trusts a third party could be appointed as servicer of the related trust if a thirdparty servicer is appointed there is no assurance that the third party will engage us as subservicer in which event we would no longer be able to control the manner in which the related trust’s assets are serviced and the failure of a third party to appropriately service such assets could lead to an early amortization event in the affected securitization trust which would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor 

lower payment rates on our securitized loans could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

certain collections from our securitized loans come back to us through our subsidiaries and we use these collections to fund our purchase of newly originated loans to collateralize our securitized financings if payment rates on our securitized loans are lower than they have historically been fewer collections will be remitted to us on an ongoing basis further certain series of our assetbacked securities include a requirement that we accumulate principal collections in a restricted account for a specified number of months prior to the applicable security’s maturity date we are required under the program documents to lengthen this accumulation period to the extent we expect the payment rates to be low enough that the current length of the accumulation period is inadequate to fully fund the restricted account by the applicable security’s maturity date lower payment rates and in particular payment rates that are low enough that we are required to lengthen our accumulation periods could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

our inability to grow our deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to grow our business 

we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers or through brokerage firms that offer our deposit products to their customers at december 31 2015  we had 297 billion  in direct deposits which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions and 137 billion  in deposits originated through brokerage firms including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger who channels brokerage account deposits to us a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to significantly expand our direct deposits 

the deposit business is highly competitive with intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits we compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits features and benefits of our products the quality of our customer service and the competitiveness of our digital banking capabilities our ability to originate and maintain retail deposits is also highly dependent on the strength of the bank and the perceptions of consumers and others of our business practices and our financial health adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to difficulties in attracting and retaining deposits accounts negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas including lending practices regulatory compliance inadequate protection of customer information or sales and marketing activities and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct 

the demand for the deposit products we offer may also be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns changes in customer preferences reductions in consumers’ disposable income regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products competition from other financial services firms and others that use deposit funding products may affect deposit renewal rates costs or availability changes we make to the rates offered on our deposit products may affect our profitability and liquidity 

the fdia prohibits an insured bank from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “well capitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates there are no such restrictions under the fdia on a bank that is “well capitalized” and at december 31 2015 the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed “well capitalized” for purposes of the fdia however there can be no assurance that the bank will continue to meet those requirements limitations on the bank’s ability to accept brokered deposits for any reason including regulatory limitations on the amount of brokered deposits in total or as a percentage of total assets in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity any limitation on the interest rates the bank can pay on deposits could competitively disadvantage us in attracting and retaining deposits and have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings funding and liquidity 

changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income and our interest expense to increase or decrease as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks at december 31 2015  556  of our loan receivables bore a fixed interest rate to the customer and we generally fund these assets with fixed rate certificates of deposit securitized financing and unsecured debt at december 31 2015  444  of our loan receivables bore a floating interest rate to the customer and we generally fund these assets with floating rate deposits assetbacked securities and unsecured debt the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is the prime rate and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the federal funds rate the prime rate and libor or the federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities to the extent we are unable to effectively match the interest rates on our assets and liabilities including in the future potentially through the use of derivatives our net earnings could be materially adversely affected 

competitive and regulatory factors may limit our ability to raise interest rates fixed or floating on our loans in addition some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers under those agreements if interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner or at all our net interest margin could be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay amounts owed to us our floating rate credit products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies bankruptcies chargeoffs and allowances for loan losses and decreasing recoveries all of which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity 

we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our net earnings of various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our net earnings and could also increase our funding costs and reduce our liquidity especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different from those we assumed for a discussion of interest rate risk sensitivities see “ item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective in mitigating our risks 

our risk management processes and procedures seek to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate risks we have established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor and control the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk liquidity risk strategic risk and operational including compliance risk credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation we are exposed to both consumer credit risk from our customer loans and institutional credit risk principally from our partners market risk is the risk of loss due to changes in external market factors such as interest rates liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet obligations and support business growth strategic risk is the risk from changes in the business environment improper implementation of decisions or inadequate responsiveness to changes in the business environment operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes people or systems external events ie natural disasters or compliance reputational or legal matters and includes those risks as they relate directly to our company as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business see “ item 1 business—credit risk management ” and “ risk management ” for additional information on the types of risks affecting our business 

we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework that includes our risk appetite statement era process risk policies procedures and controls reporting requirements credit risk culture and governance structure management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models if the models that we use to manage these risks are ineffective at predicting future losses or are otherwise inadequate we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected in addition the information we use in managing our credit and other risk may be inaccurate or incomplete as a result of error or fraud both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid there may also be risks that exist or that develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated including when processes are changed or new products and services are introduced if our risk management framework does not effectively identify and control our risks we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected and that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business and if they are not accurate or are misinterpreted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business including liquidity and capital planning including stress testing customer selection credit and other risk management pricing reserving and collections management the models may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect for a variety of reasons including as a result of errors in constructing interpreting or using the models or the use of inaccurate assumptions including failures to update assumptions appropriately or in a timely manner our assumptions may be inaccurate for many reasons including that they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and beyond our control eg macroeconomic conditions and their impact on partner and customer behaviors and they often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables factors and other assumptions the errors or inaccuracies in our models may be material and could lead us to make wrong or suboptimal decisions in managing our business and this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and failing to do so may result in high chargeoff rates 

our success depends on our ability to manage our credit risk while attracting new customers with profitable usage patterns we select our customers manage their accounts and establish terms and credit limits using proprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques that are designed to set terms and credit limits to appropriately compensate us for the credit risk we accept while encouraging customers to use their available credit the models and approaches we use to manage our credit risk may not accurately predict future chargeoffs for various reasons discussed in the preceding risk factor 

our ability to manage credit risk and avoid high chargeoff rates also may be adversely affected by economic conditions that may be difficult to predict such as the recent financial crisis although delinquencies and chargeoffs continued to decline through 2015 they both may increase in the future and are likely to increase materially if economic conditions deteriorate we remain subject to conditions in the consumer credit environment there can be no assurance that our credit underwriting and risk management strategies will enable us to avoid high chargeoff levels or delinquencies or that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover actual losses 

a customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders under mortgage credit card and other loans including student loans these changes can result from increases in base lending rates or structured increases in payment obligations and could reduce the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations to other lenders and to us in addition a customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by the restricted availability of credit to consumers generally including reduced and closed lines of credit customers with insufficient cash flow to fund daily living expenses and lack of access to other sources of credit may be more likely to increase their card usage and ultimately default on their payment obligations to us resulting in higher credit losses in our portfolio our collection operations may not compete effectively to secure more of customers’ diminished cash flow than our competitors in addition we may not identify customers who are likely to default on their payment obligations to us and reduce our exposure by closing credit lines and restricting authorizations quickly enough which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition at december 31 2015  269  of our portfolio’s loan receivables were from consumers with a fico score of 660 or less excluding unrated accounts who typically have higher delinquency and credits losses than consumers with higher fico scores 

our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations and collection regulations competitors’ actions and consumer behavior as well as inadequate collections staffing techniques models and performance of vendors such as collection agencies 

our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to cover losses on our loans 

we maintain an allowance for loan losses a reserve established through a provision for losses charged to expense that we believe is appropriate to provide for incurred losses in our loan portfolio in addition for portfolios we may acquire when we enter into new partner program agreements any deterioration in the performance of the purchased portfolios after acquisition results in incremental loss reserves growth in our loan portfolio generally would lead to an increase in the allowance for loan losses 

the process for establishing an allowance for loan losses is critical to our results of operations and financial condition and requires complex models and judgments including forecasts of economic conditions changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding our loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses we may underestimate our incurred losses and fail to maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to account for these losses in cases where we modify a loan if the modified loans do not perform as anticipated we may be required to establish additional allowances on these loans 

we periodically review and update our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to establish our allowance for loan losses to reflect our view of current conditions moreover our regulators as part of their supervisory function periodically review the methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use for calculating and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses our regulators based on their judgment may conclude that we should modify our methodology models or the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments increase our allowance for loan losses andor recognize further losses we continue to review and evaluate our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use and we will implement further enhancements or changes to them as needed we cannot assure you that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses future increases in the allowance for loan losses or recognized losses as a result of any review update regulatory guidance or otherwise will result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements are incorrect or are required to change our reported results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are required to make various assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements under gaap including for purposes of determining allowances for loan losses asset impairment reserves related to litigation and other legal matters valuation of income and other taxes and regulatory exposures and the amounts recorded for certain contractual payments to be paid to or received from partners and others under contractual arrangements in addition significant assumptions and estimates are involved in determining certain disclosures required under gaap including those involving the fair value of our financial instruments if the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect the actual amounts realized on transactions and balances subject to those estimates will be different and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently reviewing or proposing changes to several financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of our financial statements including the proposed standard on accounting for credit losses and other areas where assumptions or estimates are required as a result of changes to financial accounting or reporting standards whether promulgated or required by the fasb or other regulators we could be required to change certain of the assumptions or estimates we previously used in preparing our financial statements which could materially impact how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition generally for additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements see “ item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting estimates ” and note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated and combined financial statements 

we may not be able to offset increases in our costs with decreased payments under our retailer share arrangements which could reduce our profitability 

most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the relevant program exceeds a contractually defined threshold although the share arrangements vary by partner these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program based typically on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold however because the threshold and the economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on among other things agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses we may not be able to pass on increases in our actual expenses such as funding costs or operating expenses in the form of reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements and our economic return on a program could be adversely affected 

competition in the consumer finance industry is intense 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners the competition for partners is intense and becoming more competitive our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as alliance data american express capital one chase citibank td bank and wells fargo and to a lesser extent potential partners’ own inhouse financing capabilities some of our competitors are substantially larger have substantially greater resources and may offer a broader range of products and services we compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors including program financial and other terms underwriting standards marketing expertise service levels product and service offerings including incentive and loyalty programs technological capabilities and integration brand and reputation in addition some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting eg new account approval customer service and collections and other core banking responsibilities that we retain but some partners may prefer to handle as a result of competition we may be unable to acquire new partners lose existing relationships to competing companies or find it more costly to maintain our existing relationships 

our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain customers and generate usage of our products by them the consumer credit and payments industry is highly competitive and we face an increasingly dynamic industry as emerging technologies enter the marketplace as a form of payment our products compete with cash checks debit cards general purpose credit cards including visa and mastercard american express and discover card other private label card brands and to a certain extent prepaid cards we also compete with nontraditional providers such as paypal in the future we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies such as apple pay android pay chase pay samsung pay square and walmart pay as well as consortia of merchants that are expected to combine payment systems to reduce interchange and other costs eg currentc to the extent that our products are not accepted in or compatible with such technologies we may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry we compete for customers and their usage of our products and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances based on a number of factors including pricing interest rates and fees product offerings credit limits incentives including loyalty programs and customer service although we offer a variety of consumer credit products some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services including home and automobile loans debit cards and bank branch atm access which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitors advantages including a more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers operational efficiencies more versatile technology platforms broadbased local distribution capabilities and lowercost funding in addition some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage customer attrition from any or all of our credit products or any lowering of the pricing of our products by reducing interest rates or fees in order to retain customers could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings 

in our retail deposits business we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct banking competitors we compete for deposits with traditional banks and in seeking to grow our direct banking business we compete with other banks that have direct banking models similar to ours such as ally financial american express capital one 360 ing discover nationwide sallie mae and usaa competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors 

if we are unable to compete effectively for partners customer usage or deposits our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in that market than a more diversified company 

our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit as a result we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular to us consumer credit than a more diversified company for example our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the us economy consumer spending and consumer credit we are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at consumer credit or the specific consumer credit products that we offer including promotional financing due to our carecredit platform we are also more susceptible to increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions targeted at elective healthcare related procedures or services in contrast to other industries our business concentration could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services 

our industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technologies products and services a key part of our financial success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services including with respect to loyalty programs mobile and point of sale technologies and new synchronybranded bank deposit and credit products realizing the benefits of those products and services is uncertain we may not assign the appropriate level of resources priority or expertise to the development and commercialization of these new products services or enhancements our ability to develop acquire or commercialize competitive technologies products or services on acceptable terms or at all may be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert in addition success is dependent on factors such as partner and customer acceptance adoption and usage competition the effectiveness of marketing programs the availability of appropriate technologies and business processes and regulatory approvals success of a new product service or enhancement also may depend upon our ability to deliver it on a large scale which may require a significant investment 

we also may select utilize and invest in technologies products and services that ultimately do not achieve widespread adoption and therefore are not as attractive or useful to our partners customers and service partners as we anticipate or partners may not recognize the value of our new products and services or believe they justify any potential costs or disruptions associated with implementing them in addition because our products and services typically are marketed through our partners if our partners are unwilling or unable to effectively implement our new technologies products services or enhancements we may be unable to grow our business competitors may also develop or adopt technologies or introduce innovations that change the markets we operate in and make our products less competitive and attractive to our partners and customers 

in any event we may not realize the benefit of new technologies products services or enhancements for many years or competitors may introduce more compelling products services or enhancements our failure to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products services or enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may not realize the value of strategic investments that we pursue and such investments could divert resources or introduce unforeseen risks to our business 

we may execute strategic acquisitions or partnerships or make other strategic investments in businesses products technologies or platforms to enhance or grow our business these strategic investments may introduce new costs or liabilities which could impact our ability to grow or maintain acceptable performance 

we may be unable to integrate systems personnel or technologies from our strategic investments these strategic investments may also present unforeseen legal regulatory or other challenges that we may not be able to manage effectively the planning and integration of an acquisition partnership or investment may shift employee time and other resources which could impair our ability to focus on our core business 

strategic investments may not perform as expected due to lack of acceptance by partners customers or employees higher than forecasted costs lengthy transition periods synergies or savings not being realized and a variety of other factors this may result in a delay or unrealized benefit or in some cases increased costs or other unforeseen risks to our business 

reductions in interchange fees may reduce the competitive advantages our private label credit card products currently have by virtue of not charging interchange fees and would reduce our income from those fees 

interchange is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the network’s infrastructure and payment facilitation and which are paid to credit card issuers to compensate them for the risk they bear in lending money to customers we earn interchange fees on dual card transactions but we do not charge or earn interchange fees from our partners or customers on our private label credit card products 

merchants trying to decrease their operating expenses have sought to and have had some success at lowering interchange rates several recent events and actions indicate a continuing increase in focus on interchange by both regulators and merchants beyond pursuing litigation legislation and regulation merchants are also pursuing alternate payment platforms as a means to lower payment processing costs to the extent interchange fees are reduced one of our current competitive advantages with our partners — that we typically do not charge interchange fees when our private label credit card products are used to purchase our partners’ goods and services — may be reduced moreover to the extent interchange fees are reduced our income from those fees will be lower we received approximately 505 million  of interchange fees for the year ended december 31 2015  as a result a reduction in interchange fees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition for our dual cards we are subject to the operating regulations and procedures set forth by the interchange network and our failure to comply with these operating regulations which may change from time to time could subject us to various penalties or fees or the termination of our license to use the interchange network all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

fraudulent activity associated with our products and services could negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and cause the use of our products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase 

we are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with partners customers and third parties handling customer information our fraudrelated losses have increased significantly in recent years and were 219 million  154 million  and 134 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively our fraudrelated losses are due primarily to our dual card product which has grown in recent years and like the overall market for general purpose credit cards has experienced significant counterfeit and mailphone fraud including as a result of wellpublicized security breaches at retailers unrelated to us our products are also susceptible to application fraud because among other things we provide immediate access to the credit line at the time of approval in addition sales on the internet and through mobile channels are becoming a larger part of our business and fraudulent activity is higher as a percentage of sales in those channels than in stores dual cards and private label credit cards are susceptible to different types of fraud and depending on our product channel mix including as a result of the introduction if any of a synchronybranded general purpose credit card we may continue to experience variations in or levels of fraudrelated expense that are different from or higher than that experienced by some of our competitors or the industry generally 

the risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry in general and credit card fraud identity theft and related crimes are likely to continue to be prevalent and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated our resources technologies and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud in 2015   we reissued all active dual cards visa and mastercards that were active at the time when the portfolio was reissued with new emv chip cards with all of our retail partners but the types of fraud perpetrated will continue to shift to other fraud types and we expect to see an increase in the rates of attack in application fraud account takeover and cardnotpresent fraud high profile fraudulent activity also could negatively impact our brand and reputation which could negatively impact the use of our cards and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention such as increased customer notification requirements and mandatory issuance of cards with emv chips which could increase our costs and also negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and could lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk which could increase our costs 

cyberattacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our partners and our customers we also have arrangements in place with our partners and other third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business continuity programs our facilities and systems and those of our partners and thirdparty service providers are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events we and our partners and thirdparty service providers have experienced all of these events in the past and expect to continue to experience them in the future these events could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services although the impact to date from these events has not had a material adverse effect on us we cannot be sure this will be the case in the future 

information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies including mobile devices to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime perpetrators of fraud hackers terrorists and others in addition to cyberattacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions that are designed to disrupt key business services such as consumerfacing web sites the separation and our emergence as a separately branded company could increase our profile and therefore our risk of being targeted for cyberattacks and other security breaches including attacks targeting our key business services and websites we are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources we employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection 

we also face risks related to cyberattacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various thirdparties including our partners retailers that are not our partners where our dual cards are used merchant acquiring banks payment processors card networks eg visa and mastercard and our processors eg first data some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyberattacks and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure future security breaches or cyberattacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them we also rely on numerous other thirdparty service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them while we regularly conduct security assessments of significant thirdparty service providers we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach 

the access by unauthorized persons to or the improper disclosure by us of confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information software methodologies and business secrets could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition recently there have been a number of wellpublicized attacks or breaches directed at others in our industry that have heightened concern by consumers generally about the security of using credit cards which have caused some consumers including our customers to use our credit cards less in favor of alternative methods of payment and has led to increased regulatory focus on and potentially new regulations relating to these matters further cyberattacks or other breaches in the future whether affecting us or others could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of our cards and increased costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the failure of third parties to provide various services that are important to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

some services important to our business are outsourced to thirdparty vendors for example our credit card transaction processing production and related services including the printing and mailing of customer statements are handled by first data first data and in some cases other thirdparty vendors are the sole source or one of a limited number of sources of the services they provide for us it would be difficult and disruptive for us to replace some of our thirdparty vendors particularly first data in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future as a result of their financial or business conditions or otherwise and our business and operations likely would be materially adversely affected first data has publicly disclosed that it is highly leveraged and that it has incurred net losses of 15 billion  458 million  and 869 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively our principal agreement with first data expires in november 2026 unless it is terminated earlier or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof in addition if a thirdparty provider fails to provide the services we require fails to meet contractual requirements such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations or suffers a cyberattack or other security breach our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are replacing the thirdparty vendor that manages the technology platform for our online retail deposits this transition to a new vendor could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the technology platform for our online retail deposits is currently managed by fis and will be managed by a replacement vendor fiserv during 2015 we began the process of transitioning the core banking and deposit services provided by fis to fiserv we currently expect our planned transition to our new vendor will be completed in 2016 this transition to a new vendor could be difficult for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

disruptions in the operation of our computer systems and data centers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ability to deliver products and services to our partners and our customers service our loans and otherwise operate our business and comply with applicable laws depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems and data centers as well as those of our partners and thirdparty service providers these computer systems and data centers may encounter service interruptions at any time due to system or software failure natural disaster or other reasons in addition the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain current and integrate new systems may also cause service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause our failure to comply with applicable laws all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in connection with the separation we have migrated and in some cases established with third parties key parts of our technology infrastructure including our data centers as we migrated and continue to migrate to our new data centers our partners have needed and will need to make changes to their networks to establish connectivity with us these infrastructure changes both the ones that we make and the ones required of our partners may cause disruptions systems interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays 

we expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer credit industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies and business processes may be better than those we currently use the pace of technology change is high and our industry is intensely competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete and better ones become available a failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less competitive all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have international operations that subject us to various international risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs 

we have international operations primarily in india the philippines and canada and some of our thirdparty service providers provide services to us from other countries all of which subject us to a number of international risks including among other things sovereign volatility and sociopolitical instability us regulations also govern various aspects of the international activities of domestic corporations and increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs any failure on our part or the part of our service providers to comply with applicable us regulations as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in which we or they operate could result in fines penalties injunctions or other similar restrictions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are alleged to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights owned by others or are not able to protect our intellectual property our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competitors or other third parties may allege that we or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us infringe on their intellectual property rights we also may face allegations that our employees have misappropriated intellectual property of their former employers or other third parties given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation an assertion of an infringement claim against us may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim even if we ultimately prevail pay significant money damages lose significant revenues be prohibited from using the relevant systems processes technologies or other intellectual property cease offering certain products or services or incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses moreover it has become common in recent years for individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees in addition although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs such indemnifying party may refuse or be unable to uphold its contractual obligations 

moreover we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information including copyrights trademarks patents trade secrets and controls on access and distribution these measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage and in any event we may be required to litigate to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information from misappropriation or infringement by others which is expensive could cause a diversion of resources and may not be successful third parties may challenge invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property or our intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages our competitors or other third parties may independently design around or develop similar technology or otherwise duplicate our services or products such that we could not assert our intellectual property rights against them in addition our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure 

we have launched our new brand “synchrony” and expect to spend significant amounts over the next few years promoting the new brand we recently filed trademark applications to protect our new name in the united states and certain other countries but the registrations of many of these trademarks are not complete and they may ultimately not become registered our use of our new name for our existing or any new products in the united states or other countries may be challenged by third parties and we may become involved in legal proceedings to protect or defend our rights with respect to our new name all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses 

our business is subject to increased risks of litigation and regulatory actions as a result of a number of factors and from various sources including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry 

in the normal course of business from time to time we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business activities certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in addition while historically the arbitration provision in our customer agreements generally has limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future there may also be legislative administrative or regulatory efforts to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of predispute arbitration clauses or we may be compelled as a result of competitive pressure or reputational concerns to voluntarily eliminate predispute arbitration clauses in march 2015 the cfpb issued a report scrutinizing predispute arbitration clauses and in october 2015 the cfpb published proposals that would require any arbitration agreement included in a contract for a consumer financial product or service to provide explicitly that the arbitration agreement is inapplicable to cases filed in court on behalf of a class unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed if the cfpb proposals are enacted our exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly 

we are also involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business collectively “regulatory matters” which could subject us to significant fines penalties obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses diminished earnings and damage to our reputation the current environment of additional regulation increased regulatory compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may prevent or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services there is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will not in the future affect how we conduct our business and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we contest liability andor the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter the outcome of pending and future matters could be material to our results of operations financial condition and cash flows depending on among other factors the level of our earnings for that period and could adversely affect our business and reputation for a discussion of certain legal proceedings see “ item 1   business—regulation—consumer financial services regulation ” note 17 legal proceedings and regulatory matters  to our consolidated and combined financial statements and “ item 3   legal proceedings ” 

in addition to litigation and regulatory matters from time to time through our operational and compliance controls we identify compliance issues that require us to make operational changes and depending on the nature of the issue result in financial remediation to impacted cardholders these selfidentified issues and voluntary remediation payments could be significant depending on the issue and the number of cardholders impacted they also could generate litigation or regulatory investigations that subject us to additional adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business 

recently financial services companies have been experiencing increased reputational risk as consumers take issue with certain of their practices or judgments maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining customers partners investors and employees in particular adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could also make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy of increasing retail deposits at the bank and may lead to decreases in deposits harm to our reputation can arise from many sources including employee misconduct misconduct by our partners outsourced service providers or other counterparties litigation or regulatory actions failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality inadequate protection of customer information and compliance failures negative publicity regarding us or others engaged in a similar business or activities whether or not accurate may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and motivate key officers and employees 

our success depends in large part on our ability to retain recruit and motivate key officers and employees our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for senior executives in the financial services and payment industry is intense we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel guidance issued by the federal banking regulators as well as proposed rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the doddfrank act may limit the type and structure of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior executives in addition proposed rules under the doddfrank act would prohibit the payment of “excessive” compensation to our executives compensation paid to officers of the bank would be subject to comparable limitations these restrictions could negatively impact our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting retaining and motivating key personnel failure to retain talented senior leadership could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions and we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives may be proposed such as proposals for fundamental tax reform in the united states and lowering the corporate tax rate which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our deferred tax assets tax positions andor our tax liabilities in addition us federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our historical tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in defending our position in connection with any such challenge 

state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could change and adversely affect our results of operations 

state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could adversely affect our results of operations retailers collect sales tax from retail customers and remit those collections to the applicable states when customers fail to repay their loans including the amount of sales tax advanced by us to the merchant on their behalf we are entitled in some cases to seek a refund of the amount of sales tax from the applicable state sales tax laws and regulations enacted by the various states are subject to interpretation and our compliance with such laws is routinely subject to audit and review by the states audit risk is concentrated in several states and these states are conducting ongoing audits the outcomes of ongoing and any future audits and changes in the states’ interpretation of the sales tax laws and regulations involving the recovery of tax on bad debts could materially adversely impact our results of operations 

we could have a material indemnification obligation to ge under the tssa if we cause the splitoff from ge or certain preliminary transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment or in the case of certain significant transfers of our stock following the splitoff from ge 

ge completed its exit from its investment in us in an exchange offer that concluded in november 2015 resulting in our splitoff from ge the splitoff was designed to qualify for tax­free treatment to ge and its shareholders under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” ge obtained a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain issues relating to the tax­free treatment of the splitoff and a series of preliminary transactions that occurred prior to implementing the exchange offer although the irs private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the irs private letter ruling the irs private letter ruling addresses only certain aspects of the transaction as a result ge obtained an opinion from tax counsel confirming the taxfree treatment of the splitoff the opinion is based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by us and ge if any of those factual representations or assumptions in the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion are untrue or incomplete in any material respect any undertaking is not complied with or the facts upon which the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion was based are materially different from the facts at the time of the distribution the splitoff may not qualify for tax­free treatment opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs as a result the conclusions expressed in the opinion of counsel could be challenged by the irs and if the irs prevails in such challenge the tax consequences of the splitoff could be materially less favorable if the splitoff or any of the preliminary transactions is determined to be taxable ge and its shareholders could incur significant tax liabilities and under the tssa we entered into with ge we may be required to indemnify ge for any liabilities incurred by ge if the liabilities are caused by any action or inaction undertaken by us following the ipo or as a result of any direct or indirect transfers of our stock following the exchange offer 

in order to preserve the tax­free status of the splitoff and the preliminary transactions to ge the tssa includes a provision generally prohibiting us from taking any action or inaction that is within our control other than actions or inactions that implemented the splitoff or certain preliminary transactions or actions or inactions that are consented to by ge or are at the direction of ge that would cause the splitoff or the preliminary transactions to become taxable and providing for an indemnity obligation from us to ge for tax liabilities incurred by ge as a result of a breach of these provisions by us or as a result of any direct or indirect transfers of our stock following the exchange offer as a result we may not as part of a plan that includes the exchange offer enter into certain mergers or other change of control transactions 

the obligations associated with being an independent public company require significant resources and management attention 

as an independent public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act the sarbanesoxley act and sec rules thereunder the doddfrank act and regulations of the nyse the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sarbanesoxley act and sec rules thereunder require among other things that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting such requirements have and will increase our legal accounting and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming and costly and could be burdensome on our personnel systems and resources 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act and sec rules our management is required to conduct an annual evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and include a report of management on our internal controls in our annual reports on form 10k in addition our independent auditors will attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting beginning with this annual report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2015   failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading prices of our securities 

risks relating to regulation 

 

our business is subject to government regulation supervision examination and enforcement which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business including our relationships with our customers is subject to regulation supervision and examination under us federal state and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices treatment of our customers safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure liquidity dividends and other capital distributions transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel as a savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as a large provider of consumer financial services we are also subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb the bank is a federally chartered savings association as such the bank is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ which is its primary regulator and by the cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic we and the bank are regularly reviewed and examined by our respective regulators which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require response and attention see “ item 1   business—regulation ” for more information about the regulations applicable to us 

banking laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect federally insured deposits the dif and the banking system as a whole and not intended to protect our stockholders noteholders or creditors if we or the bank fail to satisfy applicable laws and regulations our respective regulators have broad discretion to enforce those laws and regulations including with respect to the operation of our business required capital levels payment of dividends and other capital distributions engaging in certain activities and making acquisitions and investments our regulators also have broad discretion with respect to the enforcement of applicable laws and regulations including through enforcement actions that could subject us to civil money penalties customer remediation programs increased compliance costs and limits or prohibitions on our ability to offer certain products and services or to engage in certain activities in addition to the extent we undertake actions requiring regulatory approval or nonobjection our regulators may make their approval or nonobjection subject to conditions or restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition any other actions taken by our regulators could also have a material adverse impact on our business reputation and brand results of operations and financial condition moreover some of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less restrictive legislative and regulatory regimes which may have the effect of providing them with a competitive advantage over us 

new laws or regulations or policy or practical changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our own reexamination of our current practices could adversely impact our profitability limit our ability to continue existing or pursue new business activities require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with customers affect retention of our key personnel or expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs andor customer remediation these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for example the cfpb has broad authority over our businesses see “ —there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureau’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business ” 

we are also subject to potential enforcement and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties and fines customer remediation programs and increased compliance costs as well as damage our reputation and brand and limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices for a discussion of risks related to actions or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies see “ —risks relating to our business—litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses ” 

the doddfrank act has had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the doddfrank act was enacted on july 21 2010 while certain provisions in the act were effective immediately many of the provisions require implementing regulations to be effective the doddfrank act and regulations promulgated thereunder have had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition for example the doddfrank act and related regulations restrict certain business practices impose more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements as well as additional costs including increased compliance costs and increased costs of funding raised through the issuance of assetbacked securities on us limit the fees we can charge for services and impact the value of our assets in addition the doddfrank act requires us to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution we control such as the bank such support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interest of synchrony or its stockholders noteholders or creditors we describe certain provisions of the doddfrank act and other legislative and regulatory developments in “ item 1   business—regulation ” federal agencies continue to promulgate regulations to implement the doddfrank act and these regulations may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many provisions of the doddfrank act require the adoption of additional rules to implement in addition the doddfrank act mandates multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action as a result the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations remains unclear and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureau’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business 

the cfpb which commenced operations in july 2011 has broad authority over our businesses this includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions such as us and the bank for compliance the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory supervisory and enforcement authority the federal reserve board and the occ and state government agencies may also invoke their supervisory and enforcement authorities to prevent unfair and deceptive acts or practices these federal and state agencies are authorized to remediate violations of consumer protection laws in a number of ways including collecting civil money penalties and fines and providing for customer restitution the cfpb also engages in consumer financial education requests data and promotes the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities in addition the cfpb maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the products we offer this system could inform future cfpb decisions with respect to its regulatory enforcement or examination focus 

there continues to be uncertainty as to how the cfpb’s strategies and priorities including in both its examination and enforcement processes will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward actions by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services making them less attractive to consumers less profitable to us and restricting our ability to offer them for example since 2013 we have entered into two consent orders with the cfpb  the 2013 cfpb consent order with respect to carecredit and the 2014 cfpb consent order with respect to our debt cancellation product and sales practices and an unrelated issue that arose from the bank’s selfidentified omission of certain spanishspeaking customers and customers residing in puerto rico from two offers that were made to certain delinquent customers both consent orders required remediation to certain consumers and changes to certain business practices see “ item 1 business—regulation—consumer financial services regulation ” and “ —changes to our methods of offering our carecredit products could materially impact operating results ” 

although we have committed significant resources to enhancing our compliance programs changes by the cfpb in regulatory expectations interpretations or practices or interpretations that are different or stricter than ours or those adopted in the past by other regulators could increase the risk of additional enforcement actions fines and penalties in december 2015 the cfpb published its second biennial report reviewing the consumer credit card market in the report the cfpb identified areas of concern for consumers including deferred interest products subprime specialist credit card issuers and unexpected rate increases with respect to variable interest rate products in addition the report analyzed issues regarding debt sales and debt collection practices the adequacy and availability of online disclosures as well as of the disclosures associated with rewards products and grace periods actions by the cfpb with respect to any of these areas could result in requirements to alter our products and services that may make them less attractive to consumers or less profitable to us see “ —changes to our methods of offering our carecredit products could materially impact operating results ” 

future actions by the cfpb or other regulators against us or our competitors that discourage the use of products we offer or suggest to consumers the desirability of other products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of customers if the cfpb changes regulations which were adopted in the past by other regulators and transferred to the cfpb by the doddfrank act or modifies through supervision or enforcement past related regulatory guidance or interprets existing regulations in a different or stricter manner than they have been interpreted in the past by us the industry or other regulators our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if future regulatory or legislative restrictions or prohibitions are imposed that affect our ability to offer promotional financing including deferred interest for certain of our products or require us to make significant changes to our business practices and we are unable to develop compliant alternatives with acceptable returns these restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the doddfrank act authorizes state officials to enforce regulations issued by the cfpb and to enforce the act’s general prohibition against unfair deceptive or abusive practices this could make it more difficult than in the past for federal financial regulators to declare state laws that differ from federal standards to be preempted to the extent that states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or state officials and courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer laws that differ from those adopted by the cfpb we may be required to alter or cease offering products or services in some jurisdictions which would increase compliance costs and reduce our ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide and we may be subject to a higher risk of state enforcement actions 

changes to our methods of offering our carecredit products could materially impact operating results 

the 2013 cfpb consent order relating to our carecredit platform required us to pay up to 341 million  to qualifying customers and among other things to provide additional training and monitoring of our carecredit enrolled network providers to include provisions in agreements with our carecredit enrolled network providers prohibiting charges for certain services not yet rendered to make changes to certain consumer disclosures application procedures and procedures for resolution of customer complaints and to terminate carecredit enrolled network providers that have chargeback rates in excess of certain thresholds some of the changes required by the 2013 cfpb consent order are similar to requirements in the assurance we believe the bank to be in compliance with the material business practice changes required by the 2013 cfpb consent order and the assurance subject to ongoing reporting chargeback monitoring and biannual enrolled network provider retraining obligations we will continue to actively monitor and access the impact of these changes on our carecredit program in addition to the costs of remediation which were not material for the assurance and were 341 million  for the 2013 cfpb consent order we will incur an estimated ongoing annual cost of approximately 2 million  although at this time we do not believe that the 2013 cfpb consent order and the assurance will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations going forward we may elect or be required to make changes with respect to these and other deferred interest products in the future and those changes may adversely affect customers’ use of our credit cards or our business in addition our resolutions with the cfpb and the new york attorney general do not preclude other regulators or state attorneys general from seeking additional monetary or injunctive relief with respect to carecredit and any such relief could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us 

synchrony and the bank must meet rules for capital adequacy as discussed in “ item 1 business—regulation ” as a standalone savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to capital requirements similar to those that apply to the bank we cannot predict the effects of these capital requirements on synchrony in addition synchrony and the bank may be subject to increasingly stringent capital adequacy standards in the future 

synchrony and the bank must also comply with regulatory requirements related to the maintenance management monitoring and reporting of liquidity as discussed in “ item 1 business—regulation ” these liquidity requirements are new and synchrony and the bank may become subject to additional liquidity requirements in the future we cannot predict the effects of such liquidity requirements on synchrony the bank is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and beginning on january 1 2017 synchrony will be required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the occ’s and the federal reserve board’s stress test regulations the bank is and synchrony will be required to use stresstesting methodologies providing for results under at least three different sets of conditions including baseline adverse and severely adverse conditions in addition although as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” rule the federal reserve board may in the future require us to comply with the ccar process or some modified version of the ccar process under such process   the federal reserve board would measure our minimum capital requirement levels under various stress scenarios further while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the federal reserve board’s capital planning rule we plan to prepare and submit a form of capital plan to the federal reserve board and we may in the future be required to seek the federal reserve board’s review and approval of our capital plan consistent with the capital planning rule to the extent we are made subject to the ccar process or the capital planning rule our ability to return capital to shareholders or to reinvest capital in our business may be curtailed 

if synchrony or the bank fails to meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements its operations results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected among other things failure by synchrony or the bank to maintain its status as “well capitalized” or otherwise meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements could compromise our competitive position and result in restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board or the occ including potentially on the bank’s ability to engage in certain activities these could include restrictions on the bank’s ability to enter into transactions with affiliates accept brokered deposits grow its assets engage in material transactions extend credit in certain highly leveraged transactions amend or change its charter bylaws or accounting methods pay interest on its liabilities without regard to regulatory caps on the rates that may be paid on deposits and pay dividends or repurchase stock in addition failure to maintain the well capitalized status of the bank could result in our having to invest additional capital in the bank which could in turn require us to raise additional capital the market and demand for and cost of our assetbacked securities also could be adversely affected by failure to meet current or future capital requirements 

we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends or make payments on our indebtedness 

we are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock by our regulators who have broad authority to review our capital planning and risk management processes and our current projected and stressed capital levels and to object to any capital action that they consider to be unsafe or unsound in addition the declaration and amount of any future dividends to holders of our common stock or stock repurchases will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including the financial condition earnings capital and liquidity requirements of us and the bank applicable regulatory requirements corporate law and contractual restrictions including restrictions contained in the bank term loan and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant if we are unable to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of synchrony financial see “ item 1   businessregulation—savings and loan holding company regulationdividends and stock repurchases ” 

we rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity including to pay our obligations under our indebtedness and other indebtedness as they become due and federal law limits the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us for example occ regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital including payment of dividends stock redemptions and repurchases cashout mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account the bank must obtain the occ’s approval prior to making a capital distribution in certain circumstances including if the bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements or will not do so as a result of the proposed capital distribution or certain net income requirements in addition the bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared dividend or other distribution with the federal reserve board the federal reserve board or the occ may object to a capital distribution if among other things the bank is or as a result of such dividend or distribution would be undercapitalized or the federal reserve board or occ has safety and soundness concerns additional restrictions on bank dividends may apply if the bank fails the qtl test the application of these restrictions on the bank’s ability to pay dividends involves broad discretion on the part of our regulators limitations on the bank’s payments of dividends and other distributions and payments that we receive from the bank could reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to pay dividends or our obligations under our indebtedness see “ item 1   business—regulation—savings association regulation—dividends and stock repurchases ” and “ —activities ” 

regulations relating to privacy information security and data protection could increase our costs affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities 

we are subject to various privacy information security and data protection laws including requirements concerning security breach notification and we could be negatively impacted by them for example in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the glba and implementing regulations and guidance among other things the glba i imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties ii requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties with certain exceptions and iii requires financial institutions to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches 

moreover various united states federal banking regulatory agencies states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual consumer regulatory andor law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach many of these requirements also apply broadly to our partners that accept our cards in many countries that have yet to impose data security breach notification requirements regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data security breaches 

furthermore legislators andor regulators in the united states and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy data protection and information securityrelated practices our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer andor employee information and some of our current or planned business activities this could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives in the united states this includes increased privacyrelated enforcement activity at the federal level by the federal trade commission as well as at the state level such as with regard to mobile applications 

compliance with current or future privacy data protection and information security laws including those regarding security breach notification affecting customer andor employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services such as products or services that involve us sharing information with third parties or storing sensitive credit card information which could materially and adversely affect our profitability our failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory investigations and government actions litigation fines or sanctions consumer or partner actions and damage to our reputation and our brand all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our use of thirdparty vendors and our other ongoing thirdparty business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention 

we regularly use thirdparty vendors and subcontractors as part of our business we also have substantial ongoing business relationships with our partners and other third parties these types of thirdparty relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic and our consumer regulator the cfpb regulatory guidance requires us to enhance our due diligence ongoing monitoring and control over our thirdparty vendors and subcontractors and other ongoing thirdparty business relationships including with our partners in certain cases we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors andor their subcontractors to meet these enhanced requirements which could increase our costs we expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our thirdparty relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships as a result if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our thirdparty vendors and subcontractors or other ongoing thirdparty business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately we could be subject to enforcement actions including the imposition of civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation 

failure to comply with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us 

we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act and the usa patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale these controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments we cannot be sure our programs and controls will be effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

introduction and business overview

our separation from ge 

on october 14 2015 we received approval from the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve board” to become a standalone savings and loan holding company to retain control of the bank and to retain control of our nonbank subsidiaries following the completion of ge’s offer to exchange shares of ge common stock for all of our shares of our common stock owned by ge the “exchange offer” on november 17 2015 we announced the completion of the exchange offer and our separation from ge the separation following the separation ge no longer owns any of our outstanding common stock 

our sales platforms 

 

we conduct our operations through a single business segment profitability and expenses including funding costs loan losses and operating expenses are managed for the business as a whole substantially all of our operations are within the united states we offer our products through three sales platforms retail card payment solutions and carecredit those platforms are organized by the types of products we offer and the partners we work with and are measured on platform revenue loan receivables new accounts and other sales metrics see “ item 1 business—our sales platforms ” 

 

 retail card 

retail card is a leading provider of private label credit cards and also provides dual cards and small and mediumsized business credit products our patented dual cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used elsewhere we offer one or more of these products primarily through 22  national and regional retailers with which we have ongoing program agreements the average length of our relationship with these retail card partners is 17  years retail card’s platform revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables plus other income less retailer share arrangements other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned on dual card transactions when the card is used outside of our partners sales channels and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products less loyalty program payments substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard terms 

payment solutions 

payment solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans at december 31 2015  payment solutions offered these products through participating partners consisting of national and regional retailers local merchants manufacturers buying groups and industry associations substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing payment solutions’ platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables including “merchant discounts” which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of foregone interest income associated with promotional financing 

carecredit 

carecredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures or services such as dental veterinary cosmetic vision and audiology at december 31 2015  we had a network of carecredit providers that collectively have approximately 195000  locations the vast majority of which are individual or small groups of independent healthcare providers through which we offer a carecredit branded private label credit card substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing carecredit’s platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables including merchant discounts 

our credit products 

 

through our platforms we offer three principal types of credit products credit cards commercial credit products and consumer installment loans see “ item 1 business  our credit products ” 

credit cards 

we offer two principal types of credit cards private label credit cards and dual cards 

 commercial credit products 

we offer private label cards and cobranded cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings we also offer a commercial payinfull accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers we offer our commercial credit products primarily through our retail card platform to the commercial customers of our retail card partners 

installment loans 

in payment solutions we originate installment loans to consumers and a limited number of commercial customers in the united states primarily in the power product market motorcycles atvs and lawn and garden installment loans are closedend credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments installment loans are assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates 

business trends and conditions 

 

we believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions including the following 

 a total of 17  of our 22  retail card program agreements now have an expiration date in 2019 or beyond these 17  program agreements represented in the aggregate 897  of our retail card platform revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  and 916  of our retail card loan receivables at december 31 2015  

 in addition under the terms of certain program agreements we have extended in recent years we have agreed to dedicate increased marketing expense and other investments to promote these programs we expect to benefit from these increased payments and other expenses as they will create additional incentives for our partners to support their programs and in the case of increased marketing expense and other investments directly promote these programs all of which we expect will have a positive impact on purchase volume and result in higher loan receivables and increased interest and fees on loans we also expect to benefit from the extended duration of our amended program agreements 

 

 

seasonality 

 

in our retail card and payment solutions platforms we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down 

the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations delinquency metrics and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods these fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year 

in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in chargeoffs as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end consistent with this historical experience we generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period as compared to the end of a calendar year in addition despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end reflecting these same seasonal trends

the following table sets forth certain other financial and statistical data for the periods indicated 

 

 

average balance sheet 

the following tables set forth information for the periods indicated regarding average balance sheet data which are used in the discussion of interest income interest expense and net interest income that follow 

 

 

 the following table sets forth the amount of changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in average volume and average yieldrate variances due to changes in both average volume and average yieldrate have been allocated between the average volume and average yieldrate variances on a consistent basis based upon the respective percentage changes in average volume and average yieldrate 



interest income 

interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans which includes merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities we include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over a oneyear period and recorded in interest and fees on loans for noncredit card receivables direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans 

we analyze interest income as a function of two principal components average interestearning assets and yield on average interestearning assets key drivers of average interestearning assets include 

 key drivers of yield on average interestearning assets include 

 interest income increased by 986 million  or 81  for the year ended   december 31 2015  and by 929 million or 82 for the year ended december 31 2014 these increases were driven primarily by growth in our loan receivables 

average interestearning assets   



  

the increase in average loan receivables for the year ended   december 31 2015  was driven primarily by higher purchase volume of 101  as a result of average active account growth and higher purchase volume per account average active accounts increased 44  to 626 million  for the year ended   december 31 2015  from 600 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  

the increase in average loan receivables for the year ended   december 31 2014  was driven primarily by higher purchase volume of 99 resulting from an increase in average active credit card accounts to 600 million  for the year ended december 31 2014 from 563 million  for the year ended december 31 2013 

  yield on average interestearning assets   



the decrease in yield on interestearning assets for the year ended   december 31 2015  was driven primarily by growth in our liquidity portfolio which is comprised primarily of cash and equivalents and obligations of the us treasury that mature in less than twelve months which results in a significantly lower yield than our loan receivables the yield on our average loan receivables decreased to 2122  for the year ended   december 31 2015  from 2139  for the year ended   december 31 2014  reflecting the impact of slightly higher payment rates from our customers and growth in promotional balances 

the decrease in yield on interestearning assets for the year ended december 31 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in our average interestearning cash and equivalents which earn a lower yield than our loan receivables the yield on our average loan receivables decreased slightly to 2139 for the year ended december 31 2014 from 2155 for the year ended december 31 2013 reflecting the impact of higher payment rates from our customers 

interest expense 

interest expense is incurred on our interestbearing liabilities which consisted of interestbearing deposit accounts borrowings of consolidated securitization entities the bank term loan and senior unsecured notes 

key drivers of interest expense include 

 interest expense increased by 213 million  or 231  for the year ended   december 31 2015  driven primarily by increases in average interestbearing liabilities of 7782 million  or 142  and an increase of 13 basis points in our cost of funds arising from the changes in our funding mix our cost of funds increased to 182  for the year ended   december 31 2015  from 169  for the year ended   december 31 2014  

interest expense increased by 180 million or 243 for the year ended december 31 2014 driven primarily by increases in average interestbearing liabilities of 7104 million or 149 and an increase of 13 basis points in cost of funds 

average interestbearing liabilities 



the increases in average interestbearing liabilities for the year ended december 31 2015  was driven primarily by growth in our direct deposits and the issuance of thirdparty debt to replace our related party funding from gecc 

the increase in average interestbearing liabilities for the year ended december 31 2014 were driven primarily by increases of 7705 million in our average interestbearing deposit accounts as well as from the new thirdparty debt incurred in connection with the ipo partially offset by a reduction in average borrowings under our securitization programs and our related party debt 

net interest income 

net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense we expect net interest income as a percentage of interestearning assets to be influenced by changes in the interest rate environment changes in our mix of products the level of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to our standard rates credit performance of our loans and changes in the amount and composition of our interestbearing liabilities 

net interest income increased by 773  million or 68  for the year ended   december 31 2015  driven by higher average loan receivables partially offset by increased interest expense driven by higher liquidity funding mix and growth 

net interest income increased by 749 million or 71 for the year ended december 31 2014 driven by growth in loan receivables partially offset by higher interest expense and a decrease in our yield on interestearning assets due to a higher average interestearning cash and equivalents balance 

retailer share arrangements 

most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products although the share arrangements vary by partner these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program based typically on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold the threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on among other things agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses and therefore increases in our actual expenses such as funding costs or operating expenses may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have increased in recent years both in absolute terms and as a proportion of interest income partially as a result of the growth of our receivables related to programs with retailer share arrangements and improvements in the credit performance of these receivables in addition we have made changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years that have contributed to the increase in payments to partners pursuant to retailer share arrangements 

we believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners’ interests with ours we also believe that changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have contributed to the increase in our retailer share arrangement payments will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease and mitigate the impact on our profitability in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements 

retailer share arrangements increased by 163  million or 63  for the year ended   december 31 2015  driven primarily by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements partially offset with increased other expense and loyalty costs associated with these programs 

retailer share arrangements increased by 202 million or 85 for the year ended december 31 2014 driven by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements including the effect of a lower provision for loan losses the increase was also driven by changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended program agreements in the second half of 2013 and in 2014 

provision for loan losses 

provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at each period end date provision for loan losses in each period is a function of net chargeoffs gross chargeoffs net of recoveries and the required level of the allowance for loan losses our process to determine our allowance for loan losses is based upon our estimate of the incurred loss period for each type of loss ie aged fraud deceased settlement other nonaged and bankruptcy by partner see “ critical accounting estimates  allowance for loan losses” and note 2 significant accounting policies to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our allowance for loan loss methodology 

provision for loan losses increased by 35 million  or 12  for the year ended   december 31 2015  primarily due to portfolio growth partially offset by improving asset quality trends our allowance coverage ratio decreased to 512  at december 31 2015  as compared to 528  at december 31 2014  reflecting the recent improvements in our asset quality trends 

provision for loan losses decreased by 155 million or 50 for the year ended december 31 2014 this decrease was driven primarily as a result of an incremental provision of 642 million recorded in 2013 relating to enhancements to our allowance for loan loss methodology which was not repeated in the current period this decrease was partially offset by increased provisions in 2014 primarily related to portfolio growth our allowance coverage ratio increased to 528 at december 31 2014 as compared to 505 at december 31 2013 reflecting a transition to a stable credit outlook at december 31 2014 from an improving outlook at december 31 2013 

other income 



interchange revenue   

we earn interchange fees on dual card transactions outside of our partners’ sales channels based on a flat fee plus a percent of the purchase amount we also process general purpose card transactions for some payment solutions and carecredit partners as their acquiring bank for which we obtain an interchange fee growth in interchange revenue has been and is expected to continue to be driven primarily by growth in our dual card product 

interchange revenue increased by 116 million  or 298  for the year ended december 31 2015  and by 65 million or 201 for the year ended december 31 2014  due to increased purchase volume outside of our retail partners sales channels 

debt cancellation fees 

debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance in return we will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events we offer our debt cancellation product to our credit card customers online and on a limited basis by direct mail we no longer offer this product via phone calls to our customer service department which has led to a decrease in new enrollments for this product and is expected to result in a lower level of income generated by this product in the future as the balances of existing accounts enrolled in this program decrease over time 

debt cancellation fees decreased by 26 million  or 95  for the year ended december 31 2015  and by 49 million or 151 for the year ended december 31 2014  driven by fewer customers being enrolled in the product 

loyalty programs 

we operate a number of loyalty programs in our retail card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty these programs typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a preset spending level on their private label credit card or dual card other programs provide cash back or rewards points which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards growth in loyalty program payments has been and is expected to continue to be driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs 

loyalty programs cost increased by 138 million  or 491  for the year ended december 31 2015  and by 68 million or 319 for the year ended december 31 2014 arising from the launch of new rewards programs with our partners and growth in purchase volume associated with existing loyalty programs 

other 

other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees and investment gainslosses 

other decreased by 45 million  or 441  for the year ended   december 31 2015  and increased by 37 million or 569 for the year ended december 31 2014 these changes were primarily due to a gain recorded in connection with portfolio sales in 2014 

other expense 



employee costs 

employee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs 

employee costs increased by 176 million  or 203  for the year ended december 31 2015  and by 168 million or 241 for the year ended december 31 2014  primarily related to additional compensation expenses for new employees related to the building of our standalone infrastructure and to support business growth and salary increases for existing employees 

professional fees   

professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees eg collection agencies and call centers legal accounting consulting and recruiting expenses 

professional fees increased by 82 million  or 146  for the year ended december 31 2015  these expense increases were due to business growth the separation and higher thirdparty costs related to the emv card rollout for active dual card accounts 

professional fees increased by 121 million or 249 for the year ended december 31 2014 these expense increases were due to higher professional and other consulting fees related to the ipo the separation growth of the retail deposit platform and other business growth eg increased active accounts and increased purchase volumes 

marketing and business development 

marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing and business development spend as well as amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions 

marketing and business development costs decreased by 27 million  or 59  for the year ended december 31 2015  primarily due to lower portfolio marketing investments and lower brand advertising 

marketing and business development costs increased by 191 million or 710 for the year ended december 31 2014 due to increased marketing expenses for our programs investments in our brand including the launch of our new advertising campaign and increased amortization expense associated with program acquisitions and extensions 

information processing 

information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers credit card associations and software licensing agreements 

information processing costs increased by 85 million  or 401  for the year ended december 31 2015  due to higher information technology investment and higher transaction volume 

information processing costs increased by 19 million or 98 for the year ended december 31 2014 due to higher transaction volume and increased software licensing and maintenance expense

other primarily consists of postage fraud expense litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other corporate overhead items such as facilities leases and maintenance leased equipment and telephone charges for periods prior to the ipo we incurred certain corporate overhead costs that were allocated to us by ge postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing option fraud is driven primarily by the number of our active dual card accounts 

the “other” component increased for the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to investments in growth infrastructure build in preparation for separation from ge higher fraud expense and also included expenses related to the completion of the emv card rollout for active dual card accounts these increases were largely offset by the impact of corporate overhead allocations no longer being billed to us by ge following our ipo 

the “other” component decreased for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily due to lower corporate overhead allocations and assessments from gecc and a decrease in litigation and regulatory expense these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expense driven by business growth following the ipo we no longer receive corporate overhead allocations and assessments from gecc all services provided by gecc to us following the ipo were directly billed to us in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreement and are included in the appropriate cost categories see note 15  related party transactions to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our transactions with ge and gecc 

provision for income taxes 



for periods up to and including the date of separation we are included in the consolidated us federal and state income tax returns of ge where applicable but also file certain separate state and foreign income tax returns for periods after the date of separation we will file separate consolidated us federal and state income tax returns our current obligations for taxes are settled with ge or the relevant tax authority as applicable on an estimated basis and adjusted in later periods as appropriate and are reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements in the periods in which those settlements occur we recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated and combined financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws see “ critical accounting estimates—income taxes ” for a discussion of the significant judgments and estimates related to income taxes 

the effective tax rate for the year ended   december 31 2015  decreased slightly compared to the prior year the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in certain nondeductible expenses and tax reserves for uncertain income tax positions partially offset by increases in current state tax rates and a nonrecurring tax expense incurred in the prior year related to an internal corporate reorganization in each period the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 primarily due to state income taxes 

platform analysis 

as discussed above under “ —our sales platforms ” we offer our products through three sales platforms retail card payment solutions and carecredit which management measures based on their revenuegenerating activities the following is a discussion of the platform revenue for each of our platforms 

nongaap measure 

in order to assess and internally report the revenue performance of our three sales platforms we use a measure we refer to as “platform revenue” platform revenue is the sum of three line items in our consolidated and combined statements of earnings prepared in accordance with gaap “interest and fees on loans” plus “other income” less “retailer share arrangements” platform revenue itself is not a measure presented in accordance with gaap we deduct retailer share arrangements but do not deduct other line item expenses such as interest expense provision for loan losses and other expense because those items are managed for the business as a whole we believe that platform revenue is a useful measure to investors because it represents management’s view of the net revenue contribution of each of our platforms this measure should not be considered a substitute for interest and fees on loans or other measures of performance we have reported in accordance with gaap the reconciliation of platform revenue to interest and fees on loans for each platform is set forth in the table included in the discussion of each of our three platforms below the following table sets forth the reconciliation of total platform revenue to total interest and fees on loans for the periods indicated 



retail card 

the following table sets forth supplemental information related to our retail card platform for the periods indicated 



retail card platform revenue increased by 508 million  or 73  for the year ended   december 31 2015  and by 512 million or 80 for the year ended  december 31 2014 these increases were primarily the result of an increase in interest and fees on loans driven by an increase in average loan receivables partially offset by increases in retailer share arrangement payments the increases in these payments were as a result of the factors discussed under the heading “ retailer share arrangements ” above 

payment solutions 

the following table sets forth supplemental information related to our payment solutions platform for the periods indicated 

payment solutions platform revenue increased by 118 million  or 75  for the year ended   december 31 2015  the increase was primarily the result of higher interest and fees on loans driven primarily by an increase in average loan receivables partially offset with a reduction in receivable yield 

payment solutions platform revenue increased by 67 million or 44 for the year ended december 31 2014 the increase was primarily the result of higher interest and fees on loans due to an increase in average loan receivables 

carecredit 

the following table sets forth supplemental information related to our carecredit platform for the periods indicated 



carecredit platform revenue increased by 81 million  or 50  for the year ended   december 31 2015  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest and fees on loans driven primarily by an increase in average loan receivables 

carecredit platform revenue increased by 125 million or 83 for the year ended december 31 2014 the increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest and fees on loans driven primarily by an increase in average loan receivables 

services and funding provided by ge 

 

services provided by ge 

following the separation ge no longer owns any of our outstanding common stock and is no longer a related party to us and we no longer consider our transactions with ge as related party transactions 

following the ipo ge provided a variety of services to us which were governed by the transitional services agreement “tsa” and various other agreements with ge and gecc that we entered into in connection with the ipo the services provided included among other things employee benefits and benefit administration information technology telecommunication services and leases for vehicles equipment and facilities under the tsa all of the costs billed to us by ge subsequent to the ipo were at ge’s cost in accordance with historic billing methodologies the majority of the services provided by ge have been replaced and we expect the remaining services will be replaced by mid2016 

for periods prior to the ipo we were an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of ge and gecc and in addition to the services discussed above we also received a corporate overhead allocation and assessment from ge and gecc for corporate activities that either directly or indirectly benefited our business 

funding provided by gecc 

gecc no longer provides funding to our business during the first quarter of 2015 we prepaid all of the remaining outstanding indebtedness provided under the gecc term loan prior to the ipo gecc was a key source of funding for our business 

see note 15  related party transactions to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our transactions with ge and gecc prior to the separation and see funding liquidity and capital resources  funding sources  related party debt for additional information on the funding provided by gecc to us and the related interest expense 

investment securities 

 

the following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our investment securities portfolio all of our investment securities are classified as availableforsale at december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  and are primarily shortterm obligations of the us treasury or held to comply with the community reinvestment act investment securities classified as availableforsale are reported in our consolidated statements of financial position at fair value our portfolio of investment securities consisted primarily of shortterm obligations of the us treasury state and municipal bonds and residential mortgagebacked securities 

the following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our investment securities at the dates indicated 



unrealized gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities that are not otherthantemporarily impaired are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of comprehensive income loss until realized at december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  our investment securities had gross unrealized gains of 2 million  4 million  and 1 million  respectively and gross unrealized losses of 17 million  4 million  and 16 million  respectively 

our investment securities portfolio had the following maturity distribution at december 31 2015  equity securities have been excluded from the table because they do not have a maturity 



 

 at december 31 2015  we did not hold investments in any single issuer with an aggregate book value that exceeded 10 of equity excluding obligations of the us government 

loan receivables 

 

the following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio 

loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenues the following table sets forth the composition of our loan receivables portfolio by product type at the dates indicated 



loan receivables increased by 7004 million  or 114  at december 31 2015  compared to december 31 2014  driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth 

our loan receivables portfolio had the following maturity distribution at december 31 2015  



 

 our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at december 31 2015  



 

 impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings 

our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions principal forgiveness extensions or other actions which may cause the related loan to be classified as a troubled debt restructuring “tdr” and also be impaired we use shortterm 3 to 12 months or longterm 12 to 60 months modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve longterm collectability of the loans that are classified as tdrs for our credit card customers the shortterm program primarily consists of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction both lasting for a period no longer than 12 months the longterm program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan the longterm program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments we also make loan modifications for some customers who request financial assistance through external sources such as a consumer credit counseling agency program the loans that are modified typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal interest or fees the determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions meet the tdr criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances 

loans classified as tdrs are recorded at their present value with impairment measured as the difference between the loan balance and the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan our allowance for loan losses on tdrs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows 

interest income from loans accounted for as tdrs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans we accrue interest on credit card balances until the accounts are chargedoff in the period the accounts become 180 days past due the following table presents the amount of loan receivables that are not accruing interest loans that are 90 days or more pastdue and still accruing interest and earning tdrs for the periods presented 



 

 



delinquencies 

loan delinquencies as a percentage of periodend loan receivables decreased with the over30 day delinquency rate decreasing to 406  at december 31 2015  as compared to 414  at december 31 2014  the 8 basis point decrease compared to the same period in prior year was primarily driven by general improvement in the us economy 

net chargeoffs 

net chargeoffs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible net of recovered amounts we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and thirdparty fraud losses from chargeoffs chargedoff and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while thirdparty fraud losses are included in other expense chargeoffs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses and subsequent recoveries of previously chargedoff amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses costs incurred to recover chargedoff loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our consolidated and combined statements of earnings 

the table below sets forth the ratio of net chargeoffs to average loan receivables including held for sale for the periods indicated 



allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses totaled 3497  million at december 31 2015  compared with 3236 million  at december 31 2014  representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the increase in allowance for loan losses was primarily driven by an increase in our expected losses driven by growth in loan receivables 

the following tables provide changes in our allowance for loan losses for the periods presented 











 

 

funding liquidity and capital resources 

 

we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital our funding liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations our business growth our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments 

funding sources 

our primary funding sources include cash from operations deposits direct and brokered deposits thirdparty debt and securitized financings 

the following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated 

 

 deposits 

we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers “direct deposits” or through thirdparty brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers “brokered deposits” at december 31 2015  we had 297 billion  in direct deposits which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions and 137 billion  in deposits originated through brokerage firms including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to significantly expand our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding 

our direct deposits include a range of fdicinsured deposit products including certificates of deposit iras money market accounts and savings accounts 

brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms we have relationships with 10  brokers that offer our deposits through their networks our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at december 31 2015  had a weighted average remaining life of 34  years these deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal 

our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to among other things the interest rates we pay and therefore we bear funding and interest rate risk if we fail or are required to pay higher rates to attract new deposits or retain existing deposits to mitigate these risks we pursue a funding strategy that seeks to match our assets and liabilities by interest rate and expected maturity characteristics and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources including securitized financings including our undrawn committed capacity and unsecured debt 

over the next several years we are seeking to increase our direct deposits through investing in our direct deposit programs and capabilities the growth of direct deposits will be supported by a significant investment in marketing and brand awareness 

the following table summarizes certain information regarding our interestbearing deposits by type all of which constitute us deposits for the periods indicated 

 

 our deposit liabilities provide funding with maturities ranging from one day to ten years at december 31 2015  the weighted average maturity of our interestbearing time deposits was 22  years see note 7 deposits  to our consolidated and combined financial statements for more information on their maturities 

the following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity at december 31 2015  



 

 securitized financings 

we have been engaged in the securitization of our credit card receivables since 1997 we access the assetbacked securitization market using the synchrony credit card master note trust “synct” through which we issue assetbacked securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits in addition we issue assetbacked securities in private transactions through the synchrony sales finance master trust “sft” and the synchrony receivables trust “srt” 

at december 31 2015  we had 60 billion  of outstanding private assetbacked securities and 76 billion  of outstanding public assetbacked securities in each case held by unrelated third parties 

the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors’ interests in securitized financings at december 31 2015  

 

 we retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through i in the case of synct sft and srt subordinated retained interests in the receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series to provide credit enhancement for a particular series as well as a pari passu seller’s interest in each trust and ii subordinated classes of synct notes that we own 

all of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers referred to as early amortization events including events related to material breaches of representations warranties or covenants inability or failure of the bank to transfer loans to the trusts as required under the securitization documents failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents and certain insolvencyrelated events with respect to the related securitization depositor synchrony solely with respect to synct or the bank in addition an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series falls below zero following an early amortization event principal collections on the loans in our trusts are applied to repay principal of the assetbacked securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business the occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred no early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in synct sft or srt 

the following table summarizes for each of our trusts the threemonth rolling average excess spread at december 31 2015  



 

 thirdparty debt 

bank term loan 

on august 5 2014 we borrowed the full amount under the bank term loan with thirdparty lenders that provided 80 billion principal amount of unsecured term loans maturing in 2019 in 2014 we prepaid 505 million of the bank term loan using a portion of the net proceeds from our issuance of senior unsecured notes in october 2014 we amended the bank term loan to among other things increase the amount of indebtedness that the company may incur by 750 million and this amount was borrowed in full 

during the year ended december 31 2015  we prepaid an additional 41 billion  in the aggregate of the bank term loan which included the use of a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in february july and december 2015 at december 31 2015  the total indebtedness outstanding under the bank term loan was 42 billion  and the weighted average interest rate was 217  

subsequent to december 31 2015  we prepaid an additional 27 billion  in the aggregate of the bank term loan the total indebtedness outstanding under the bank term loan following the additional prepayments was 15 billion  

there are no required amortization payments or prepayments of the bank term loan 

senior unsecured notes 



   

the net proceeds from the above issuances were primarily used to prepay our indebtedness under the gecc term loan and bank term loan 

in addition on august 11 2014 we issued a total of 36 billion of senior unsecured notes with various maturities ranging from 2017 through 2024 we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of unsecured senior notes to prepay 505 million of the bank term loan 

at december 31 2015  the amount outstanding of our senior unsecured notes debt was 66 billion  and the weighted average interest rate on the unsecured notes was 331  

related party debt 

during the first quarter of 2015 we prepaid 655 million of the gecc term loan which represented all of the remaining outstanding indebtedness under that agreement and gecc no longer provides funding to our business 

for periods prior to our ipo in 2014 gecc was a key source of our debt funding pursuant to various intercompany funding arrangements 

the aggregate interest and fees incurred with respect to funding provided by gecc to us was 4 million  113 million  and 157 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

shortterm borrowings 

except as described above there were no material shortterm borrowings for the periods presented 

undrawn securitized financings   

at december 31 2015  we had an aggregate of 61 billion  of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under two of our existing securitization programs 

other   

at december 31 2015  we had more than 250 billion  of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window 

covenants 

the bank term loan includes a affirmative covenants which among other things require the bank to remain a whollyowned subsidiary of ours and b negative covenants which among other things restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability subject to various exceptions to incur liens incur indebtedness engage in transactions with affiliates amend the master agreement and enter into certain restrictive agreements the negative covenants also restrict our ability subject to certain exceptions to undergo various fundamental changes including mergers liquidations saleleaseback transactions and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets 

the bank term loan also contains financial covenants to be tested on a quarterly basis that require i synchrony to maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 ratio of not less than 10  ii synchrony to maintain minimum liquidity of not less than 40 billion  and iii the bank to maintain minimum liquidity of not less than 20 billion  the bank term loan includes customary events of default including the occurrence of a change of control not including the separation and the occurrence of certain material adverse regulatory events 

the indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants including covenants that restrict subject to certain exceptions synchrony’s ability to dispose of or incur liens on any of the voting stock of the bank or otherwise permit the bank to be merged consolidated leased or sold in a manner that results in the bank being less than 80  controlled by us 

if we do not satisfy any of the covenants discussed above the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december 31 2015  

our real estate leases also include various covenants but typically do not include financial covenants if we do not satisfy the covenants in the real estate leases the leases may be terminated and we may be liable for damage claims at december 31 2015  we were not in default under any of our credit facilities and had not received any notices of default under any of our real estate leases 

credit ratings 

our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of the company the bank and the ratings of our assetbacked securities 

our senior unsecured debt issued in 2014 and 2015 was rated bbb stable outlook by fitch and bbb stable outlook by sp in addition certain of the assetbacked securities issued by synct are rated by fitch sp andor moody’s a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

liquidity 

 

we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations fund asset growth satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions 

we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business which is the responsibility of our asset and liability management committee a subcommittee of our enterprise risk management committee we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process we evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs 

we maintain a liquidity portfolio which at december 31 2015  had 148 billion  of liquid assets primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and shortterm obligations of the us treasury less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid compared to a 129 billion  liquidity portfolio at december 31 2014  the increase in liquid assets was primarily due to debt financings and also the retention of excess cash flows from operations within our company 

as additional sources of liquidity at december 31 2015  we had an aggregate of 61 billion  of undrawn committed capacity subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under two of our existing securitization programs and we had more than 250 billion  of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window 

as a general matter investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash the level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions 

we will rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity however bank regulations contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the bank’s ability to pay dividends see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends or make payments on our indebtedness ” and “ regulation—savings association regulation—dividends and stock repurchases ” 

capital 

 

our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our businesses and existing equity capital the proceeds from the ipo in 2014 also increased our equity capital significantly we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our businesses meet regulatory requirements adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments within these constraints we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders 

our capital adequacy assessment also includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance we maintain a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet and we include this asset when calculating our regulatory capital levels however for regulatory capital purposes deferred tax assets i are limited to the amount of taxes previously paid that a company could recover through loss carrybacks and ii 10 of the amount of our tier 1 capital at december 31 2015 no portion of our deferred tax asset was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes 

the bank is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and beginning on january 1 2017 the company will be required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the occs and the federal reserve boards stress test regulations the bank is and the company will be required to use stresstesting methodologies providing for results under at least three different sets of conditions including baseline adverse and severely adverse conditions in addition while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the federal reserve boards capital planning rule we prepare and submit a capital plan to the federal reserve board 

dividend and share repurchases 

the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including the financial condition earnings capital and liquidity requirements of us and the bank regulatory restrictions corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make repurchases of our stock for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on our and the bank’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock see “ risk factors—risks relating to regulation—we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends or make payments on our indebtedness ” 

regulatory capital requirements  synchrony financial 

as a savings and loan holding company we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios under the applicable us basel iii capital rules for more information see “ regulation—savings and loan holding company regulation ” 

for synchrony financial to be a wellcapitalized savings and loan holding company synchrony bank must be wellcapitalized and synchrony financial must not be subject to any written agreement order capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued by the federal reserve board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure as of december 31 2015 synchrony financial met all the requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized 

the following table sets forth at december 31 2015  and 2014  the composition of our capital ratios for the company calculated under the basel iii and basel i regulatory capital standards respectively 



 

 

nongaap measures 

the capital ratios presented above include common equity tier 1 capital cet1 as calculated under the us basel iii capital rules on a fully phasedin basis which is not currently required by our regulators to be disclosed and as such is considered to be a nongaap measure in addition we also present certain capital ratios for the company at december 31 2014 as calculated under the us basel i capital rules which are also considered to be nongaap measures we believe that these capital ratios are useful measures to investors because they are widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies although these ratios may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table sets forth a reconciliation of each component of our capital ratios set forth above to the comparable gaap component at december 31 2015  and 2014  





 

 

regulatory capital requirements  synchrony bank 

at december 31 2015  and 2014  the bank met all applicable requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized pursuant to occ regulations and for purposes of the federal deposit insurance act effective january 1 2015 the bank became subject to the us basel iii regulatory capital standards subject to transition provisions the following table sets forth the composition of the bank’s capital ratios calculated under the basel iii rules at december 31 2015  and calculated under basel i rules at december 31 2014  





failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see “ risk factors—risks relating to regulation—failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us ” 

offbalance sheet arrangements and unfunded lending commitments 

 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements including guarantees of thirdparty obligations guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a thirdparty based on certain trigger events at december 31 2015  we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position related to any guarantees 

we extend credit primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards in the ordinary course of business see note 4  loan receivables and allowance for loan losses  to our consolidated and combined financial statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments 

contractual obligations 

 

in the normal course of business we enter into various contractual obligations that require future cash payments our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations at december 31 2015 are summarized below 

 

 critical accounting estimates 

 

in preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties the critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for loan losses asset impairment income taxes and fair value measurements all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables future impairments of investment securities goodwill and intangible assets and the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities among other effects see note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated and combined financial statements which discusses the significant accounting policies related to these estimates 

allowance for loan losses 

losses on loan receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of probable losses takes into account our historical experience adjusted for current conditions with each product and customer type and our judgment concerning the probable effects of relevant observable data trends and market factors 

we evaluate each portfolio quarterly for credit card receivables our estimation process includes analysis of historical data and there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance our risk process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or on a portfolio basis as appropriate more specifically we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables we use other analyses to estimate losses incurred on nondelinquent accounts the considerations in these analyses include past performance risk management techniques applied to various accounts historical behavior of different account vintages current economic conditions recent trends in delinquencies bankruptcy filings account collection management policy changes account seasoning loan volume and amounts payment rates forecasting uncertainties and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for losses which compares this allowance for losses to projected net chargeoffs over the next 12 months in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance we do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis but instead estimate its allowance for credit card loan losses on a portfolio basis further experience is not available for new portfolios therefore while we are developing that experience we set loss allowances based on our experience with the most closely analogous products in our portfolio the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates 

asset impairment 

investments 

we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria for debt securities if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows for equity securities our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we do not amortize goodwill but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is defined under gaap as the operating segment or one level below that operating segment the component level if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management our operating segment consists of a single reporting unit based on the level at which management regularly reviews and measures the business operating results 

goodwill impairment risk is first assessed under fasb accounting standards update “asu” 201108 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment  by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors for our reporting unit if potential goodwill impairment risk exists that indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value we apply a twostep quantitative test the first step compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of our reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step is applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill is considered impaired and reduced to its implied fair value the qualitative assessment for each period presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements was performed without hindsight assuming only factors and market conditions existing as of those dates and resulted in no potential goodwill impairment risk for our reporting unit consequently goodwill was not deemed to be impaired for any of the periods presented 

definitelived intangible assets principally consist of customerrelated assets including contract acquisitions and purchased credit card relationships these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the evaluation compares the cash inflows expected to be generated from each intangible asset to its carrying value if cash flows attributable to the intangible asset are less than the carrying value the asset is considered impaired and written down to its estimated fair value no impairments of definitelived intangible assets have been recognized in the periods presented 

income taxes 

we are subject to income tax in the united states federal state and local as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate our provision for income tax expense is based on our income the statutory tax rates and other provisions of the tax laws applicable to us in each of these various jurisdictions these laws are complex and their application to our facts is at times open to interpretation the process of determining our consolidated income tax expense includes significant judgments and estimates including judgments regarding the interpretation of those laws our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities incorporate those judgments and estimates and reflect management’s best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities as well as the impact of tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks and are measured using the enacted income tax laws and rates that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are specific to the jurisdiction in which they arise and are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization of those assets is more likely than not in making decisions regarding our ability to realize tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income taxable income in carryback periods expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the implementation of available tax planning strategies these decisions rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and our short and longrange business forecasts to provide insight 

asc 740 income taxes  establishes the framework by which we determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to be maintained for uncertain income tax positions applying this framework we recognize the financial statement impact of uncertain income tax positions when we conclude that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits of a position that the position will be sustained upon examination in certain situations we establish a liability that represents the difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return and the amount of taxes recognized in our financial statements 

fair value measurements 

assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances primarily include loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost method and equity method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired 

assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs a fair value measurement is determined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued 

new accounting standards 

 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap when it becomes effective in july 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of this standard with a revised effective date for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective cumulative effect transition method we are evaluating the effect that asu 201409 will have on our consolidated and combined financial statements and related disclosures we have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 interest  imputation of interest the asu changes the financial statement presentation of debt issuance costs from being presented as an asset to a direct reduction to the carrying amount of the longterm debt the amortization of debt issuance costs will continue to be included in interest expense this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 we are currently evaluating the effect of the asu on our consolidated and combined financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates see “ item 1a risk factors—risks relating to our business—changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings funding and liquidity ” and “ —a reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets ” 

interest rate risk   

we borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is generally the prime rate and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either libor or the federal funds rate the prime rate and the libor or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities 

competitive factors and future regulatory reform may limit or restrict our ability to raise interest rates fixed or floating on our loans in addition some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers if interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner our net interest income and margin could be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us our floating rate products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowances for loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity 

to manage interest rate risk we generally pursue a match funding strategy pursuant to which we seek to match the interest rate repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities at december 31 2015  556  of our loan receivables bore a fixed interest rate to the customer and we have historically funded these assets with fixed rate certificates of deposit securitized financing and unsecured debt at december 31 2015  444  of our loan receivables bore a floating interest rate to the customer and we generally fund these assets with floating rate deposits securitized financing and unsecured debt historically we have not used interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk to the extent we are unable to effectively match the interest rates on our assets and liabilities our net earnings could be materially adversely affected 

we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our net interest income 

for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates over the 12month period from our reporting date we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period the sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously simultaneously and to the same degree 

our interestrate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity portfolio at december 31 2015  444  of our receivables bore a floating interest rate assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature or otherwise contractually reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12month period are considered to be rate sensitive the latter category includes certain loans that may be offered at belowmarket rates for an introductory period such as balance transfers and special promotional programs after which the loans will contractually reprice under standard terms in accordance with our normal marketbased pricing structure for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice ie assets are categorized as fixed or floating according to their underlying contractual terms for assets that have a fixed interest rate at the period end but which contractually will or are assumed to reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 

interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12month period thus liabilities that vary with changes in a marketbased index such as the federal funds rate or libor which will reset before the end of the 12month period or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a marketbased indexed rate prior to the end of the 12month period also are considered to be rate sensitive for these fixed rate liabilities net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 

assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december 31 2015  we estimate that net interest income over the following 12month period would increase by approximately 107 million  

limitations of market risk measures   

the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information internallydeveloped assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments other market inputs such as interest rates market prices and interest rate volatility are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures we regularly evaluate update and enhance these assumptions models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities 

there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates the sensitivity analysis provided above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet it does not attempt to estimate the effect of a more significant interest rate increase over a sustained period of time which as described in “ —interest rate risk ” above could adversely affect our net interest income in addition the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ from our projections which could cause our actual net interest income to differ from the above sensitivity analysis

no change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2015  that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting 

 

the management of synchrony financial and subsidiaries “the company” is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company as defined by exchange act rules 13a15 and 15d15 the companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the companys assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the companys receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate although any system of internal control can be compromised by human error or intentional circumvention of required procedures we believe our system provides reasonable assurance that financial transactions are recorded and reported properly providing an adequate basis for reliable financial statements 

the company’s management has used the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

the company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting is effective there are no material weaknesses in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that have been identified by the company’s management

 formation and regulation of synchrony 

 

synchrony is a holding company for the legal entities that historically conducted ge’s north american retail finance business synchrony was incorporated in delaware on september 12 2003 but prior to april 1 2013 conducted no business during the period from april 1 2013 to september 30 2013 as part of a regulatory restructuring substantially all of the assets and operations of ge’s north american retail finance business including the bank were transferred to synchrony the remaining assets and operations of that business subsequently were transferred to synchrony in 2014 

as a savings and loan holding company the company is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board in addition as a large provider of consumer financial services the company is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb 

the bank is a federally chartered savings association and therefore is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency of the us treasury the “occ” which is its primary regulator and by the cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic 

for a discussion of the regulation of the company and the bank see “ —regulation ” for information regarding certain regulatory matters including consent orders or assurances of discontinuances that we have entered into with the cfpb the department of justice the “doj” and the attorney general for the state of new york relating to our carecredit platform our debt cancellation product and sales practices and certain collection offers see “ —regulation—consumer financial services regulation ” and “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—changes to our methods of offering our carecredit products could materially impact operating results ” 

our initial public offering 

 

on august 5 2014 we closed the ipo of 125 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of 2300 per share and on september 3 2014 we issued an additional 35 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters in the ipo we received net proceeds from the ipo including the underwriters’ option of approximately 28 billion 

ge ownership and our separation from ge 

 

ge currently owns 100 of the common stock of gecc gecc currently owns 100 of the common stock of gecfi and gecfi currently owns 846 of our common stock 

steps to our separation from ge   on november 15 2013 ge announced that it planned a staged exit from our business consistent with its strategy of reducing gecc’s percentage of ge’s total earnings and increasing gecc’s focus on its commercial lending and leasing businesses ge’s exit from our business is expected to consist of three distinct but interrelated steps described below 

 

 bank regulatory approvals required for separation and the ge slhc deregistration   in addition to ge’s application for the ge slhc deregistration we will be required to file an application with and receive approval from the federal reserve board to continue to be a savings and loan holding company and to retain ownership of the bank following the separation and the ge slhc deregistration in reviewing and acting on our application the federal reserve board will consider a range of factors and has significant discretion we do not expect the federal reserve board to act on our application until among other things it has completed an indepth review as to our preparedness to operate on a standalone basis independently of ge and is satisfied with the results we anticipate that this review will not begin until after we have filed our application and will require a considerable period of time we are taking and will continue to take significant steps in order to prepare to operate on a standalone basis independently from ge including the following 

 

anticipated timeframe for separation and ge slhc deregistration   ge has indicated that it currently is targeting to complete the separation in late 2015 we may not be prepared or able to satisfy the federal reserve board that we are prepared to operate on a standalone basis independent of ge by that time more generally the conditions to any transaction involved in the separation may not be satisfied in late 2015 or thereafter or ge may decide for any reason not to consummate the separation in late 2015 or thereafter further ge’s willingness to proceed with the separation may effectively be conditioned on its obtaining the necessary determination by the federal reserve board that the ge slhc deregistration will occur upon separation although the separation and the ge slhc deregistration need not coincide for this reason any delays in obtaining the ge slhc deregistration may delay the consummation of the separation 

anticipated costs associated with separation and ge slhc deregistration   we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional expenses to operate as a fully independent public company for a discussion of these expenses see “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business trends and conditions ” and “ —services and funding provided by ge ” 

for a discussion of certain risks associated with separation and the ge slhc deregistration including risks related to anticipated timing and costs see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to our separation from ge ” 

our sales platforms 

 

we offer our credit products through three sales platforms retail card payment solutions and carecredit set forth below is a summary of certain information relating to our retail card payment solutions and carecredit platforms 



retail card 

retail card is a leading provider of private label credit cards and also provides dual cards and small and mediumsized business credit products retail card accounted for 69 billion  or 683  of our total platform revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard ie nonpromotional terms 

retail card’s platform revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables plus other income less retailer share arrangements other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned on dual card transactions when the card is used outside of our partners’ sales channels and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products less loyalty program payments 

retail card partners 

we have ongoing retail card programs with 19  national and regional retailers which have approximately 33000  retail locations and include department stores specialty retailers mass merchandisers multichannel electronic retailers online retailers and oil and gas retailers at december 31 2014 we also had retail card programs with three additional retailers with program agreements that have expired or otherwise will not extend beyond their current contractual expiration dates in 2015 representing 13 of our total retail card loan receivables including loan receivables held for sale at december 31 2014 in the fourth quarter of 2014 we also entered into an agreement with an additional retail card partner bp for which we expect the associated program to begin in mid2015 at december 31 2014 nearly 90 of retail card loan receivables including loan receivables held for sale were under program agreements with an expiration date in 2018 or beyond set forth below is certain information regarding the ongoing 19 retail card partners at december 31 2014 



 

 our ten largest retail card programs accounted in aggregate for 598  of our total platform revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 our programs with jcpenney and walmart each accounted for more than 10 of our total platform revenue and jcpenney lowe’s and walmart each accounted for more than 10 of our total platform interest and fees and other income in each case for the year ended december 31 2014 we also have programs with sam’s club a subsidiary of walmart pursuant to separate program agreements for purposes of the information provided in this paragraph with respect to walmart the platform revenue and interest and fees and other income from the sam’s club programs have not been included 

our retail card programs are governed by program agreements that are each negotiated separately with our partners although the terms of the agreements are partnerspecific and may be amended from time to time under a typical program agreement our partner agrees to support and promote the program to its customers but we control credit criteria and issue credit cards to customers who qualify under those criteria we generally own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination other key provisions in the retail card program agreements include 

term retail card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years most program agreements have renewal clauses that provide for automatic renewal for one or more years until terminated by us or our partner we typically seek to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates since january 1 2012 we have extended the duration of many of our retail card program agreements to a new expiration date in 2017 or beyond set forth below is certain information regarding the current scheduled expiration dates of our ongoing 19 retail card partner programs 

 exclusivity the program agreements typically are exclusive for the products we offer and limit our partners’ ability to originate or promote other private label or cobranded credit cards during the term of the agreement 

retailer share arrangements most of our retail card program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractuallydefined threshold economic performance for the purposes of these arrangements is typically measured based on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses we may also provide additional economic benefits to our partners such as a signing bonus royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts all of these arrangements align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products 

other economic terms in addition to the retailer share arrangements the program agreements typically provide that the parties will develop a marketing plan to support the program it sets the terms by which a joint marketing budget is funded the basic terms of the rewards program linked to the use of our product such as opportunities to receive double rewards point for purchases made on a retail card product and the allocation of costs related to the rewards program 

termination the program agreements set forth the circumstances in which a party may terminate the agreement prior to expiration our program agreements generally permit us and our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons including if the other party materially breaches its obligations some program agreements also permit our partner to terminate the program if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria we fail to achieve certain approval rate targets with respect to approvals of new customers we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds or we are not adequately capitalized or if certain force majeure events occur or certain changes in our ownership which we do not believe will be triggered by the splitoff occur certain of these program agreements are also subject to early termination by a party if the other party has a material adverse change in its financial condition historically these rights have not typically been triggered or exercised some of our program agreements provide that upon termination or expiration our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loan receivables generated with respect to its program at fair market value or a stated price including all related customer data 

acquiring new retail card partners 

we seek to partner with medium to large financially strong retailers who have a national or regional footprint and a desire to grow their business through effective consumer financing programs our business development team proactively targets and engages with potential partners that either do not have a card program or may be receptive to an opportunity for us to acquire their existing program the team responds to competitive requests for proposals “rfps” and informal inquiries initiated by retailers from january 1 2012 through december 31 2014 we added three new retail card partners in the fourth quarter of 2014 we also entered into an agreement with an additional retail card partner bp for which we expect the associated program to begin in mid2015 

acquiring and marketing to retail card customers 

we work directly with our partners using their distribution network communication channels and customer interactions to market our products to their customers and potential customers we believe our presence at our partners’ points of sale and our ability to make credit decisions instantly for a customer that is already predisposed to make a purchase enables us to acquire new customer accounts at significantly lower costs than general purpose card issuers who typically market directly to consumers through mass mailings and advertising 

to acquire new customers we collaborate with our partners and leverage our marketing expertise to create marketing programs that promote our products for creditworthy customers frequently our partners market the availability of credit as part of and with little incremental cost to the advertising for their goods and services our marketing programs include marketing offers eg 10 off the customer’s first purchase and consumer communications that are delivered through a variety of channels including instore signage online advertising retailer website placement associate communication emails and text messages direct mail campaigns advertising circulars and outside marketing via television radio and print we also employ our proprietary quickscreen and equickscreen acquisition methods to make targeted preapproved credit offers at the pointofsale both instore and online our quickscreen and equickscreen technology allows us to run customer information we have obtained from our partners through our risk models in advance so that when these customers seek to make payment for goods and services at our partners instore or online point of sale we can make a credit offer instantly if appropriate based on our experience due to the personalized and immediate nature of the offer quickscreen and equickscreen significantly outperform traditional directtoconsumer preapproved channels such as direct mail or email in response rate and dollar spending 

after a customer obtains one of our retail card products our marketing programs encourage card utilization by continuing to communicate our products’ value propositions such as depending on the program promotional financing offers cardholder events product discounts dollaroff certificates accountholder sales reward points and offers new product announcements and previews and free or reduced cost gift wrapping alteration or delivery services through our partners’ distribution channels 

through our crm and data analytics teams we track cardholder responsiveness to our marketing programs and use this research to target marketing messages and promotional offers to cardholders based on their individual characteristics such as length of relationship and spending pattern for example if a cardholder responds positively to a coupon sent by text message we will tailor future marketing messages so that they are delivered by text message our ability to target marketing messages and promotions is enhanced for dual card programs because we receive collect and analyze data on instore and all other spending 

we also manage retail loyalty programs these programs typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a preset spending level on their private label or dual card the merchandise discounts can be mailed to the cardholder accessed online or may be immediately redeemable at the partner’s store other programs provide cash back or reward points which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards these loyalty programs are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer while reinforcing the value of the card to the customer and strengthening customer loyalty in the future we intend to offer loyalty programs to customers that utilize noncredit payment types such as cash debit or check these multitender loyalty programs will allow our partners to market to an expanded customer base and allow us access to additional prospective cardholders

national and regional retailers and manufacturers for the payment solutions programs we have established with national and regional retailers and manufacturers the terms of our program agreements typically are similar to the terms of our retail card program agreements in that we are the exclusive program provider of financing for the national or regional retailer or manufacturer with respect to the financing products we offer the term of the program agreements generally run from three to five years and are subject to termination prior to the scheduled termination date by us or our partner for various reasons including if the other party materially breaches its obligations some of these programs also permit our partner to terminate the program if we change certain key cardholder terms elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds certain force majeure events occur certain changes in our ownership occur or there is a material adverse change in our financial condition a few of these programs also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us eg several months many of these program agreements have renewal clauses which allow the program agreement to be renewed for successive one or more year terms until terminated by us or our partner we typically negotiate with program participants to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates 

we control credit criteria and issue credit cards or provide installment loans to customers who qualify under those credit criteria we own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination our payment solutions program agreements set forth the program’s economic terms including the merchant discount applicable to each promotional finance offering we typically do not pay fees to our payment solutions partners pursuant to any retailer share arrangements but in some cases we pay a signup fee to a partner or provide volume based rebates on the merchant discount paid by the partner in addition to the credit programs we also process general purpose card transactions for some merchants and dealers under programs with manufacturers as their acquiring bank within most of the credit card network associations for which we receive an interchange fee 

buying groups and industry associations for the payment solutions programs we have established with buying groups and industry associations such as the north american home furnishings association jewelers of america and mega group usa the programs are governed by program agreements under which we make our credit products available to their respective members or dealers but these agreements generally do not require the members or dealers to offer our products to their customers under the terms of the program agreements buying groups and industry associations generally agree to support and promote the respective programs these arrangements may include signup fees and volume based incentives paid by us to the groups and their members in addition to these credit programs we also process general purpose card transactions for some merchants and dealers as their acquiring bank within most of the credit card network associations for which we receive an interchange fee 

individuallybranded programs our individuallybranded payment solutions programs are focused on specific industries where we create either company branded or company and partner branded private label credit cards that are usable across all participating locations within the industryspecific network for example our carcareone program comprised of merchants selling automotive parts repair services and tires covers 18000  locations across the united states and cards issued may be dual branded with carcareone and partners such as midas michelin tires or pep boys under the terms of these programs we establish merchant discounts applicable to each financing offer and in some cases the fees we charge partners for their membership in the network 

dealer agreements for the payment solutions programs we have established with manufacturers buying groups industry associations and individuallybranded programs described above we enter into individual agreements with the merchants and dealers that offer our credit products under these programs these agreements generally are not exclusive and some parties who offer our financing products also offer financing from our competitors our agreements generally continue until terminated by either party with termination typically available to either party at will on 15 days’ written notice our dealer agreements set forth the economic terms associated with the program including the fees charged to dealers to offer promotional financing and in some cases allow us to periodically change the fees we charge 

acquiring new payment solutions partners

carecredit partners 

the vast majority of our partners are individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers the remainder are national and regional healthcare providers and manufacturers such as lcavision heartland dental starkey laboratories and the veterinary centers of america vca antech at december 31 2014 we had carecredit agreements with approximately 156000  healthcare providers these partners collectively have approximately 186000  locations during 2014 over 156000 of these locations either processed a carecredit application or made a sale on a carecredit credit card no one carecredit partner accounted for more than 04  of our total platform revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 carecredit’s platform revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 is diversified across five major specialties dental  632  veterinary  153  cosmetic and dermatology  96  vision  59  audiology  26  and other markets  34  

we enter into provider agreements with individual healthcare providers who become part of our carecredit network these provider agreements are similar to the dealer agreements that govern our relationships with the merchants and dealers offering our payment solutions products in that the agreements are not exclusive and typically may be terminated at will on 15 days’ notice there typically are no retailer share arrangements with partners in carecredit 

acquiring new carecredit partners 

carecredit includes a network of healthcare practitioners that provide elective procedures that generally are not covered by insurance we screen potential partners using a variety of criteria including whether the potential provider specializes in one of our approved specialties carries the appropriate licensing and certifications and has a strong credit history we also screen potential partners for reputational issues we work with professional and other associations manufacturers buying groups industry associations and healthcare consultants to educate their constituents about the products and services we offer at december 31 2014 we had relationships with over 100  professional and other associations including the american dental association and the american animal hospital association manufacturers and buying groups which endorse and promote our credit products to their members of these relationships over 60  were paid endorsements linked to member enrollment in and volume under the relevant program we believe our ability to attract new partners is aided by our customer satisfaction rate which our research in 2014 shows is 89  we also approach individual healthcare service providers through direct mail and advertising and at trade shows we have increased the number of our carecredit partner locations from approximately 154000  at december 31 2011 to approximately 186000  at december 31 2014 

acquiring and marketing to carecredit customers 

we market our products through our provider network by training our network providers on the advantages of carecredit products and by making marketing materials available for providers to use to promote the program and educate customers our training helps our providers learn to discuss payment options during the pretreatment consultation phase including the option to apply for a carecredit credit card and the offer of promotional credit according to a 2014 survey of our carecredit customers 48  indicated that they would have postponed or reduced scope of treatment if financing was not offered by their provider consumers can apply for our carecredit products in the provider’s office or online via the web or mobile device 

we also market our products to potential and existing customers directly through our webbased partner locator which allows customers to search for healthcare service providers that accept the carecredit credit card by desired geography and provider type according to our records our carecredit partner locator averaged over 600000 hits per month during the year ended december 31 2014 we believe our partners recognize the locator as an important source of new customer acquisition our extensive marketing activities targeted to existing customers have yielded high levels of carecredit card reuse across the network with 47 of purchase volume across our carecredit network during the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from repeat use at one or more providers 

our credit products 

 

we offer three principal types of credit products credit cards commercial credit products and consumer installment loans we also offer a debt cancellation product 

the following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer at december 31 2014 



credit cards 

our credit card products are loans we extend through openended revolving credit card accounts we offer two principal types of credit cards private label credit cards and dual cards 

private label credit cards 

private label credit cards are partnerbranded credit cards eg lowe’s or amazon or programbranded credit cards eg carcareone or carecredit that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network in addition in some cases cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances 

credit under a private label credit card typically is extended on either standard terms only which means accounts are assessed periodic interest charges using an agreed nonpromotional fixed andor variable interest rate or pursuant to a promotional financing offer involving deferred interest no interest or reduced interest during a set promotional period promotional periods typically range between six and 48 months but we may agree to longer terms with the partner in almost all cases we receive a merchant discount from our partners to compensate us for all or part of the cost of providing the promotional financing feature the terms of these promotions vary by partner but generally the longer the deferred interest reduced interest or interestfree period the greater the partner’s merchant discount some offers permit customers to pay for a purchase in equal monthly payments with no interest or at a reduced interest rate rather than deferring or delaying interest charges 

in retail card credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only and in payment solutions and carecredit credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended pursuant to a promotional financing offer in carecredit standard rate financing generally applies to charges under 200 

we typically do not charge interchange or other fees to our partners when a customer uses a private label credit card to purchase our partners’ goods and services through our payment system 

most of our private label credit card business is in the united states for some of our partners who have locations in canada we also support the issuance and acceptance of private label credit cards at their locations in canada and from customers in canada 

dual cards 

our proprietary dual cards are general purpose credit cards that are cobranded with our partner’s own brand and may be used to make purchases of goods or services from our partner functioning as a private label credit card or purchases from others wherever cards from those card networks are accepted functioning as a general purpose credit card or cash advance transactions we currently issue dual cards for use on the visa and mastercard networks and we currently have the ability to issue dual cards for use on the american express and discover networks 

we have been granted two us patents relating to the process by which our dual cards function as a private label credit card when used to make purchases from our partners and function as a general purpose credit card when used on the systems of other credit card associations 

credit extended under our dual cards typically is extended on standard terms only currently only retail card offers dual cards at december 31 2014 we offered dual cards through 14  of our 19 continuing retail card programs we expect to continue to increase the number of partner programs that offer dual cards and seek to increase the portion of our loan receivables attributable to dual cards 

charges using a dual card generate interchange income for us in connection with purchases made by cardholders other than in store or online from the partner 

we currently do not issue dual cards in canada 

loyalty programs 

we operate a number of loyalty programs in our retail card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty these programs typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a preset spending level on their private label credit card or dual card other programs provide cash back or reward points which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards 

terms and conditions 

as a general matter the financial terms and conditions governing our credit card products vary by program and product type and change over time although we seek to standardize the nonfinancial provisions consistently across all products the terms and conditions of our credit card products are governed by a cardholder agreement and applicable laws and regulations 

we assign each card account a credit limit when the account is initially opened thereafter we may increase or decrease individual credit limits from time to time at our discretion based primarily on our evaluation of the customer’s creditworthiness and ability to pay to the extent required by law or regulation we send a monthly billing statement to each customer who has an outstanding debit or credit balance 

for the vast majority of accounts periodic interest charges are calculated using the daily balance method which results in daily compounding of periodic interest charges subject to at times a grace period on new purchases cash advances are not subject to a grace period and some credit card programs do not provide a grace period for promotional purchases in addition to periodic interest charges we may impose other charges and fees on credit card accounts including as applicable and provided in the cardholder agreement cash advance transaction fees and late fees where a customer has not paid at least the minimum payment due by the required due date 

typically each customer with an outstanding debit balance on his or her credit card account must make a minimum payment each month a customer may pay the total amount due at any time without penalty we also may enter into arrangements with delinquent customers to extend or otherwise change payment schedules and to waive interest charges andor fees 

commercial credit products 

we offer private label cards and cobranded cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings we also offer a commercial payinfull accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers and are rolling out an improved customer experience for this product with enhanced functionality we offer commercial credit products primarily through our retail card platform to the commercial customers of our retail card partners 

installment loans 

in payment solutions we originate installment loans to consumers and a limited number of commercial customers in the united states primarily in the power segment installment loans are closedend credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments the terms of our installment loans are governed by customer agreements and applicable laws and regulations 

installment loans are assessed periodic interest charges using fixed interest rates in addition to periodic interest charges we may impose other charges and fees on loan accounts including late fees where a customer has not made the required payment by the required due date and returned payment fees 

debt cancellation products 

we offer a debt cancellation product to our credit card customers customers who choose to purchase this product are charged a monthly fee based on their ending balance on each billing statement in return the bank will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events in october 2012 we ceased telesales of debt cancellation protection products and only offer a debt cancellation product online and on a limited basis by direct mail 

direct banking 

 

through the bank we offer our customers a range of fdicinsured deposit products directly through our optimizer plus   platform the bank also takes deposits through thirdparty securities brokerage firms that offer our fdicinsured deposit products to their customers at december 31 2014 we had 350 billion  in deposits 197 billion  of which were direct deposits which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions and 153 billion  of which were brokered deposits direct deposits were received from approximately 150000  customers that had a total of over 250000  accounts retail customers account for 97 of our direct deposits by volume and 99 of our accounts by number and commercial customers account for the remainder the bank had an 89  retention rate on certificates of deposit balances up for renewal for the year ended december 31 2014 fdic insurance is provided for our deposit products up to applicable limits 

in january 2013 we acquired the deposit business of metlife which is a direct banking platform that at the time had 64 billion in deposits 60 billion in direct deposits the acquisition of this directtoconsumer retail banking platform is a key part of our strategy to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding going forward our online platform is highly scalable allowing us to expand without having to rely on a traditional “brick and mortar” branch network we expect growth in our direct banking platform to come primarily from retail deposits 

we are growing our direct banking operations and believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the consumer drivenshift from branch banking to direct banking according to 2012 and 2014 american bankers association surveys the percentage of customers who prefer to do their banking via direct channels internet mail phone and mobile increased from 53 to 54 between 2010 and 2014 while those who prefer branch banking declined from 25 to 21 over the same period 

our deposit products include certificates of deposit iras money market accounts and savings accounts we market our deposit products through multiple channels including our online print and radio advertising customers can apply for fund and service their deposit accounts online or via phone we have a dedicated staff within our call centers to service deposit accounts historically we also offered a partnerbranded prepaid reloadable card product to the customers of a few of our retail card partners 

to attract new deposits and retain existing ones we intend to introduce new deposit and credit products and enhancements to our existing products these new and enhanced products may include the introduction of checking accounts overdraft protection lines of credit a bill payment account feature and synchronybranded debit and general purpose credit cards as well as enhanced small business deposit accounts and expanded affinity offers our focus on deposittaking and related branding efforts will also enable us to offer other branded directbanking products more efficiently in the future 

fidelity national information services inc “fis” provides our platform for online retail deposits including a customerfacing servicing platform that customers can access via our marketing site fis also provides supplemental back office it production and it development support for our direct banking operations 

we seek to differentiate our deposit product offerings from our competitors on the basis of brand reputation convenience customer service and value we have launched a subbrand for our deposit products called optimizer plus  which emphasizes reliability trust security convenience and attractive rates optimizer plus perks   offers rewards to customers based on their tenure or balance amounts including reduced fees travel offers and concierge telephone support 

credit risk management 

 

credit risk management is a critical component of our management and growth strategy credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from customer default when customers are unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to us our credit risk arising from consumer credit products is generally highly diversified across over 115 million  open accounts at december 31 2014 without significant individual exposures we manage credit risk primarily according to customer segments and product types 

customer account acquisition 

we have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and have developed varying credit decision guidelines for the different partners we originate credit accounts through several different channels including instore mail internet mobile telephone and preapproved solicitations in addition we have and may in the future acquire accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners 

regardless of the channel in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit we follow a series of credit risk and underwriting procedures in most cases when applications are made instore or by internet or mobile the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately we generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus the credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to calculate a credit score the risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio and product type we periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance and adjust the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage risk different scoring models may be used depending upon bureau type and account source 

we also apply additional application screens based on various inputs including credit bureau information to help identify potential fraud and prior bankruptcies before qualifying the application for approval we compare applicants’ names against the specially designated nationals list maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury “ofac” as well as screens that account for adherence to usa patriot act of 2001 the “patriot act” and credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 the “card act” requirements including ability to pay requirements 

we occasionally use preapproved account solicitations for certain programs potential applicants are prescreened using information provided by our partner or obtained from outside lists and qualified individuals receive a preapproved credit offer by mail or email 

acquired portfolio evaluation 

our risk management team evaluates each portfolio we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our credit risk guidelines as part of this review we receive data on the thirdparty accounts and loans which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information in addition we benchmark potential portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks finally our risk management team must approve the acquisition taking into account the results of our risk assessment process once assets are migrated to our systems our account management protocols will apply immediately as described below under “ —customer account management ” “ —credit authorizations of individual transactions ” and “ —collections ” 

customer account management 

we regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts this ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customer’s performance with respect to its account with us as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer’s broader credit performance to monitor and control the quality of our loan portfolio including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active account on its monthly cycle date proprietary risk models together with the fico scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly are an integral part of our credit decisionmaking process depending on the duration of the customer’s account risk profile and other performance metrics the account may be subject to a range of account actions including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits 

credit authorizations of individual transactions 

once an account has been opened when a credit card is used to make a purchase instore at one of our partners’ locations or online pointofsale terminals or online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system which allows for realtime updating of accounts each potential sales transaction is passed through a transaction authorization system which takes into account a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved or declined and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted 

fraud investigation 

we provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings new account fraud and transactional fraud we have developed a proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customer’s established pattern our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers we also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud recently we began implementing embedded security chip technology such as the socalled “emv chips” with some of our partners 

collections 

all monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts collections personnel generally initiate contact with customers within 30 days after any portion of their balance becomes past due the nature and the timing of the initial contact typically a personal call email text message or letter are determined by a review of the customer’s prior account activity and payment habits 

we reevaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques including internal collection activities and use of external vendors as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent we limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the transaction authorization processes the imposition of credit limits and criteriabased account suspension and revocation processes in certain situations we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules decrease interest rates andor waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us 

customer service 

 

customer service is an important feature of our relationship with our partners our customers can contact us via phone mail email eservice and echat during the year ended december 31 2014 we handled approximately 209 million  calls 

we assign a dedicated tollfree customer service phone number to each of our retail card programs our payment solutions customers access customer service through one general purpose tollfree customer service phone number except for a few large payment solutions programs which have dedicated tollfree numbers our carecredit platform has its own dedicated tollfree customer service phone number we also have dedicated tollfree customer service phone numbers for our deposit business 

we service all programs through our nine domestic and two offshore call centers we also provide phonebased customer service through a thirdparty vendor our offshore facilities are located in hyderabad india and manila philippines we blend domestic and offshore locations and seek optimal cost as an important part of our servicing strategy customer service for cards issued to customers in canada is supported through agents based in the united states 

given the nature of our business and the high volume of calls we maintain several centers of excellence to ensure the quality of our customer service across all of our sites these centers of excellence consist of quality assurance customer experience training workforce and capacity planning surveillance and process control tactical operations center business solutions and technology support 

production services 

 

our production services organization oversees a number of services including 

 

 all united states customer payments received by mail are processed at one of two centers located in atlanta georgia and longwood florida both of which are operated by the bank united states credit card statement printing and mailing card embossing and mailing and letter production and mailing for customers is provided through outsourced services with first data corporation “first data” while these services are outsourced we monitor and maintain oversight of these other services first data also produces our statements and other mailings for deposit customers 

card production embossing and mailing and statement printing and mailing services related to cards issued to customers in canada are outsourced to canadian suppliers 

technology 

 

we leverage information technology and deliver products and services that meet the needs of our partners and enable us to operate our business efficiently the integration of our technology with our partners is at the core of our value proposition enabling among other things customers to “apply and buy” at the point of sale and many of our partners to settle transactions directly with us without an interchange fee a key part of our strategic focus is the continued development of innovative efficient flexible technology and operational platforms to support marketing risk management account acquisition and account management customer service and new product development we believe that the continued investment in and development of these platforms is an important part of our efforts to increase our competitive capabilities reduce costs improve quality and provide faster more flexible technology services consequently we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems processes and competencies to meet our business needs 

as part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technologies we may either develop these capabilities internally or rely on thirdparty providers we rely on thirdparty providers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and in some cases architecture designed by us these relationships include first data for our credit card transaction processing and production and fis for retail banking 

to protect our systems and technologies and the consumer information stored on our systems we employ security backup and recovery systems and generally require the same of our most significant thirdparty service providers our information security policy and supporting standards and procedures including multiple layers of security controls are designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of consumer data and ensure that access is limited to those with a business need we evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls through ongoing assessment and measurement we have implemented a security program that is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store process or have access to material consumer data 

in addition we perform or cause to be performed a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms systems and applications used to provide our products and services in an effort to reduce the risk that any attacks on these platforms systems and applications are successful we also perform periodic test and validation of our disaster recovery plans and require certain of our third parties to do so as well in connection with the separation we must migrate and in some cases establish with third parties key parts of our technology infrastructure including our data centers 

competition 

 

our industry is highly competitive and is becoming more competitive we compete for relationships with partners in connection with retaining existing or establishing new consumer credit programs our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as alliance data american express capital one chase citibank td bank and wells fargo and to a lesser extent potential partners’ own inhouse financing capabilities we compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors including program financial and other terms underwriting standards marketing expertise service levels product and service offerings including incentive and loyalty programs technological capabilities and integration brand and reputation in addition some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting eg new account approval customer service and collections and other core banking responsibilities that we retain 

we also compete for customer usage of our products consumer credit provided and credit card payments made using our cards constitute only a small percentage of overall consumer credit provided and credit card payments in the united states consumers have numerous financing and payment options available to them as a form of payment our products compete with cash checks debit cards visa and mastercard credit cards as well as american express discover card other privatelabel card brands and to a certain extent prepaid cards we also compete with nontraditional providers such as paypal in the future we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies such as apple pay google wallet and square as well as consortia of merchants that are expected to combine payment systems to reduce interchange and other costs eg currentc to the extent that our products are not accepted in or compatible with such technologies we may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry we compete for customers and their usage of our products and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances based on a number of factors including pricing interest rates and fees product offerings credit limits incentives including loyalty programs and customer service some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services including home and automobile loans debit cards and bank branch atm access which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs in addition some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are may have substantially greater resources than we do or may offer a broader range of products and services than we do moreover some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage 

in our retail deposits business we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct banking competitors we compete for deposits with traditional banks and in seeking to grow our direct banking business we compete with other banks that have direct banking models similar to ours such as ally financial american express capital one 360 ing discover nationwide sallie mae and usaa competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to quickly and easily deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors 

intellectual property 

 

we use a variety of methods such as trademarks patents copyrights and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property we also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures our brands are important assets and we take steps to protect the value of these assets and our reputation following the ipo we launched our new brand “synchrony” and expect to spend significant amounts over the next few years promoting our new brand 

we have two patents for proprietary methods related to our dual cards the patents were issued in 2005 and 2010 and expire in 2023 and 2027 respectively 

we recently filed trademark applications to protect our new name in the united states and certain other countries and the applications are pending 

employees 

 

at december 31 2014 we had approximately 11000 full time employees none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we have not experienced any material employmentrelated work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good we also have relationships with thirdparty call center providers in the united states and other countries that provided us with additional contractors for customer service collections and other functions 

risk management 

 

strong risk management is at the core of our business strategy and we have developed processes to manage the major categories of risk we encounter namely credit market liquidity operational and strategic risk historically the risk function for substantially all of our operations has been managed through the risk management function at the bank level we established an overall risk management function at the company level in connection with the ipo building on our extensive wellestablished risk management experience and processes at the bank the bank maintains a substantial risk management function that is coordinated with our overall risk management the following is a description of our overall risk management function 

as described in greater detail below under “ —risk management roles and responsibilities ” we manage our enterprise risk using an integrated framework that includes boardlevel oversight administration by a group of crossfunctional management committees and daytoday implementation by a dedicated risk management team led by the chief risk officer “cro” the risk committee of our board of directors has responsibility for the oversight of our risk management program and three other board committees have other oversight roles with respect to risk management several management committees and subcommittees have important roles and responsibilities in administering our risk management program including the enterprise risk management committee the “ermc” the management committee the “mc” and the asset and liability management committee the “alco” this committeefocused governance structure provides a forum through which risk expertise is applied crossfunctionally to all major decisions including development of processes policies and controls used by the cro and risk management team to execute our risk management philosophy 

our enterprise risk management philosophy is to ensure that all relevant risks in our business activities are appropriately identified measured monitored and controlled our approach in executing this philosophy focuses on leveraging our strong credit risk culture to drive enterprise risk management using a strong governance framework a comprehensive enterprise risk assessment program and an effective risk appetite framework 

risk categories 

our risk management is organized around five major risk categories credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk and strategic risk we evaluate the potential impact of a risk event on us including the bank and other subsidiaries by assessing the partner and customer financial reputational and legal and regulatory impacts 

credit risk 

credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation credit risk includes exposure to consumer credit risk from customer loans as well as institutional credit risk principally from our partners consumer credit risk is one of the most significant risks we face see “ — credit risk management” for a description of our customer credit risk management procedures 

market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss due to changes in external market variables such as interest rates and asset values our principal market risk exposures arise from volatility in interest rates and their impact on our economic value capitalization levels and earnings market risk is managed through our alco processes and is subject to policy and risk appetite limits for both earnings at risk and the economic value of equity sensitivity analysis the alco reviews market risk scenario results on a monthly basis and interest rate risk appetite metrics are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the ermc and our board of directors 

liquidity risk 

liquidity risk is the risk that an institution’s financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by a real or perceived inability to meet contractual obligations and support planned growth our primary liquidity objective is to maintain a liquidity profile that will enable us even in times of stress or market disruption to fund our existing assets and meet all of our liabilities in a timely manner and at an acceptable cost policy and risk appetite limits require us and the bank and other entities within our business as applicable to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are available to survive liquidity stresses over a specified time period our risk appetite policies also call for funding diversification monitoring early warning indicators in the capital markets and limits on the amounts of certificates of deposit maturities in any one month our alco reviews liquidity exposures continuously in the context of approved policy and risk appetite limits and reports results quarterly to the ermc and our board of directors 

operational risk 

operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes people or systems external events ie natural disasters or compliance reputational or legal matters and includes any of those risks as they relate directly to us and our subsidiaries including the bank as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules regulations and internal policies and procedures operational risk also includes model risk relating to various financial and other models used by us and our subsidiaries including the bank and is subject to a formal governance process 

strategic risk 

strategic risk consists of the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from changes in the business environment and from adverse business decisions improper implementation of decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the business environment our operational risk team will conduct a formal strategic risk assessment at least annually and establish risk mitigation plans for top strategic risks the bank’s new product innovation council assesses the strategic viability and consistency of each new bank product or service new initiatives require the approval of the mc and our board of directors in the case of projects deemed more risky or critical to the mission of the business

regulation 

 

general 

our business including our relationships with our customers is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination under us federal state and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices treatment of our customers safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure liquidity dividends and other capital distributions transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel 

as a savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board prior to july 21 2011 savings and loan holding companies such as the bank’s parent before synchrony were subject to regulation by the office of thrift supervision “ots” as a large provider of consumer financial services we are also subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb until the ge slhc deregistration we will be controlled by gecc which is also a savings and loan holding company and is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board in addition the financial stability oversight council has designated gecc as a nonbank systemically important financial institution a “nonbank sifi” under the doddfrank act 

the bank is a federally chartered savings association as such the bank is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the occ which is its primary regulator and by the cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank act which was enacted in july 2010 significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the united states as discussed further throughout this section certain aspects of the doddfrank act are subject to further rulemaking that will take effect over several years making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us or across the industry see also “ item 1a  risk factors—risks relating to regulation—the doddfrank act has had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations ” 

savings and loan holding company regulation 

overview 

as a savings and loan holding company we are required to register and file periodic reports with and are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board the federal reserve board has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as liquidity risk management securitizations operational risk management internal controls and audit systems business continuity and compensation and other employee benefits we are regularly reviewed and examined by the federal reserve board which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require our response and attention our parent gecc as a savings and loan holding company is also regularly reviewed and examined by the federal reserve board which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of gecc’s business generally and our business specifically that require response and attention 

the federal reserve board has broad enforcement authority over us and our subsidiaries other than the bank and its subsidiaries under the doddfrank act we are required to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution that we control such as the bank in addition until the ge slhc deregistration we will be controlled by gecc which has its own regulatory obligations as a savings and loan holding company and as a nonbank sifi we may be affected by those obligations of gecc see “ —gecc’s regulatory status ” and “ item 1a risk factors—risks relating to regulation—as long as we are controlled by gecc for bank regulatory purposes regulation and supervision of gecc could adversely affect us ” 

capital 

as a savings and loan holding company synchrony historically has not been required to maintain any specific amount of minimum capital beginning as soon as 2015 however we expect that synchrony will be subject to capital requirements similar to those applicable to the bank in addition until the ge slhc deregistration we will be controlled by gecc which itself is expected to be subject to capital requirements similar to those which apply to the bank as well as any enhanced capital standards that may be imposed on it as a nonbank sifi the capital requirements applicable to the bank have recently been substantially revised including as a result of basel iii and the requirements of the doddfrank act although we cannot predict the effects of the newly adopted rules implementing basel iii and the doddfrank act synchrony and gecc expect to be subject to increasingly stringent capital adequacy standards in the future see “ —gecc’s regulatory status ” and “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—as long as we are controlled by gecc for bank regulatory purposes regulation and supervision of gecc could adversely affect us ” 

the following are the minimum capital ratios to which we and gecc expect to be subject starting as soon as during 2015 

 for a discussion of our capital ratios see “ item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—capital ” 

in connection with applicable capital adequacy standards we and gecc will also be required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the federal reserve board’s stress test regulations we and gecc will each be required to utilize stresstesting methodologies providing for results under at least three different sets of conditions including baseline adverse and severely adverse conditions in addition as part of meeting our minimum capital requirements we and gecc may be required to comply with the federal reserve board’s comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” process or some modified version of the ccar process which would measure our minimum capital requirement levels under various stress scenarios in connection with such a process we and gecc may be required to develop for the federal reserve board’s review and approval a capital plan that will include how we and gecc will meet our minimum capital requirements under specified stress scenarios 

dividends and stock repurchases 

we are limited in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock by the federal reserve board including on the basis that doing so would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice if we intend to declare or pay a dividend we generally will be required to inform and consult with the federal reserve board in advance to ensure that such dividend does not raise supervisory concerns it is the policy of the federal reserve board that a savings and loan holding company like us should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition 

according to guidance from the federal reserve board our dividend policies will be assessed against among other things our ability to achieve applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements if we do not achieve applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements when they are fully phasedin we may not be able to pay dividends although we currently expect to meet the applicable final basel iii capital ratio requirements inclusive of any applicable capital conservation buffer when they are fully phased in by the federal reserve board we cannot be sure that we will meet those requirements or even if we do if we will be able to pay dividends 

we also will be required to inform and consult with the federal reserve board in advance of redeeming or repurchasing our stock if the result will be a net reduction in our equity compared to our equity as of the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs in evaluating the appropriateness of a proposed redemption or repurchase of stock the federal reserve board will consider among other things the potential loss that we may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets as a result of continued asset deterioration and our ability to raise additional common equity and other capital to replace the stock that will be redeemed or repurchased the federal reserve board also will consider the potential negative effects on our capital structure of replacing common stock with any lowertier form of regulatory capital issued moreover the approval process for any capital plan we are required to submit could result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions 

until the ge slhc deregistration we will be controlled by gecc which as a savings and loan holding company is subject to all of the same regulatory requirements regarding dividends and stock repurchases and redemptions to which we are subject accordingly until the ge slhc deregistration our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our shares may be affected by gecc’s ability to meet the same requirements to which we are subject in addition as a nonbank sifi gecc may be required to provide a capital plan for federal reserve board approval that includes proposed capital distributions including dividends and stock redemptions or repurchases not only by gecc but also by entities controlled by gecc such as us as long as we are controlled by gecc for bank regulatory purposes any such capital plan requirement imposed on gecc by the federal reserve board could affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our shares or redeem the notes prior to maturity 

activities 

in general savings and loan holding companies may only conduct or acquire control of companies engaged in financial activities specified in the relevant provisions of the bank holding company act and savings and loan holding company act we and each of our current parent companies are not subject to these activity restrictions and therefore are permitted to engage in nonfinancial activities because we are grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies this grandfathered status is based on the fact that our parent companies ge and gecc became grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies through the conversion of ge capital retail bank from a state bank to a federal savings bank under an application pending with the ots before may 4 1999 we succeeded to our parent companies’ grandfathered status upon becoming a savings and loan holding company on april 1 2013 

our certificate of incorporation provides that until the earlier to occur of i the time immediately prior to the splitoff and ii the ge slhc deregistration no stockholder or group other than ge or its affiliates and certain other exempt persons shall have the right to vote more than 499 of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors we are not aware of any stockholder or group other than ge or its affiliates that has acquired or otherwise owns or controls more than 499 of our capital stock including through the ipo assuming the ge slhc deregistration occurs and possibly at the separation if it occurs prior to the ge slhc deregistration we expect we will then no longer qualify to be a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to our separation from ge—we need federal reserve board approval to continue to be a savings and loan holding company following the ge slhc deregistration we may not receive this approval in a timely manner or at all and additional approval conditions beyond what we are anticipating may be imposed that prevent or delay the separation or the ge slhc deregistration or require us to incur significant additional expense ” if we were no longer to qualify to be a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company we would be subject to the activity restrictions in that event although we are not currently engaged in nonfinancial activities we will also need to submit to the federal reserve board a request to become a financial holding company in order to engage in activities that are permissible only for savings and loan holding companies that are treated as financial holding companies including to continue to obtain financing through our securitization programs 

even as a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company and until the ge slhc deregistration as a subsidiary of gecc which is also a savings and loan holding company we and the bank are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit in certain respects the types of acquisitions and investments that we can make for example certain acquisitions of and investments in depository institutions or their holding companies that we undertake are subject to the prior review and approval of our banking regulators including the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic our banking regulators have broad discretion on whether to approve such acquisitions and investments in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition or investment federal bank regulators may consider among other factors i the effect of the acquisition or investment on competition ii our and until the ge slhc deregistration gecc’s financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels iii the competence experience and integrity of our and until the ge slhc deregistration gecc’s management and its and their record of compliance with laws and regulations iv the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including our and until the ge slhc deregistration gecc’s record of compliance under the community reinvestment act the “cra” v our and until the ge slhc deregistration gecc’s effectiveness in combating money laundering and vi any risks that the proposed acquisition poses to the us banking or financial system in addition as long as we are a subsidiary of gecc which is a nonbank sifi as well as a savings and loan holding company we or gecc may be required to provide notice to the federal reserve board in advance of our acquiring voting shares of a company other than an fdicinsured depository institution that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature and that has total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more 

certain acquisitions of our voting stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal law investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not directly or indirectly acquire shares of our stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval under the change in bank control act and the savings and loan holding company act which prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us without in most cases the prior written approval of the federal reserve board

savings associations including the bank are subject as well to limitations on their lending and investments these limitations include percentage of asset limitations on various types of loans the bank may make in addition there are similar limitations on the types and amounts of investments the bank may make 

insured depository institutions including the bank are subject to restrictions under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act as implemented by federal reserve board regulation w which govern transactions between an insured depository institution and any affiliate including an entity that is the institution’s direct or indirect holding company and a nonbank subsidiary of such a holding company restrictions in sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act apply to “covered transactions” such as extensions of credit issuances of guarantees or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit made by the insured depository institution to an affiliate must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and that the aggregate amount of covered transactions is limited as to any one affiliate of the bank to 10 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus and as to all of the bank’s affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the bank’s capital stock and surplus in addition transactions between the bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered by the bank to nonaffiliated companies ie at arm’s length 

the cra is a federal law that generally requires an insured depository institution to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments offer products and provide services in each case designed to meet the credit needs of these communities the cra also requires an institution to maintain comprehensive records of cra activities to demonstrate how it is meeting the credit needs of communities these records are subject to periodic examination by the responsible federal banking agency of the institution based on these examinations the agency rates the institution’s compliance with cra as “outstanding” “satisfactory” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance” the cra requires the agency to take into account the record of an institution in meeting the credit needs of the entire communities served including low and moderate income neighborhoods in determining such rating failure of an institution to receive at least a “satisfactory” rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities including acquisitions the bank received a cra rating of “outstanding” as of its most recent cra examination 

the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “wellcapitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates there are no such restrictions under the fdia on a bank that is “wellcapitalized” further “undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations at december 31 2014 the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized for purposes of the fdia an inability to accept brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity 

in connection with the occ’s december 12 2012 approval of the bank’s assumption of certain deposits and related liabilities of metlife and acquisition of certain assets of metlife the bank entered into an operating agreement with the occ the “operating agreement” and also into a capital assurance and liquidity maintenance agreement with gecc gecfi and synchrony the “calma” on january 11 2013 the material terms of the operating agreement and the calma are summarized below and the operating agreement and the calma have been filed as exhibits to this report

the operating agreement provides that if the occ determines there is an existing or imminent material breach of the bank’s obligation to maintain the required amounts of capital or liquidity or gecc gecfi and synchrony are likely to be unable to fulfill their obligations under the calma due to a material adverse change in the financial condition of gecc gecfi or synchrony or in certain other circumstances the bank must submit to the occ a plan for the sale merger or dissolution of the bank and must implement such plan upon obtaining the occ’s nonobjection and written direction to begin implementation subject to a right on the bank’s part to cure the basis for such direction within 15 days of its issuance the operating agreement also provides that the occ may require the bank to immediately cease extending new or additional credit under certain circumstances including if i the occ determines there is an existing or imminent material breach of the bank’s obligation to maintain the required amounts of capital or liquidity or gecc gecfi and synchrony are likely to be unable to fulfill their obligations under the calma due to a material adverse change in the financial condition of gecc gecfi or synchrony ii the occ deems that breach or change likely to pose an imminent threat to the financial condition of the bank and iii such breach or change has not been cured or remedied as the case may be within five days of receiving written notice from the occ the operating agreement imposes certain monitoring and reporting obligations including among other things notification to the occ regarding material changes to the financial condition of the bank gecc gecfi and synchrony the operating agreement will remain in effect until it is terminated in writing by the occ the bank ceases to be a federal savings association or the consummation of a merger consolidation or other business combination in which the bank is not the resulting entity

deposit insurance 

the fdia requires the bank to pay deposit insurance assessments deposit insurance assessments are affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the federal deposit insurance fund the “dif” the doddfrank act increased the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the dif to 135 and removed the statutory cap on the reserve ratio the fdic subsequently set a reserve ratio of 2 and may increase that ratio in the future under the fdic’s current deposit insurance assessment methodology the bank is required to pay deposit insurance assessments based on its average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity and various other regulatory factors included in an fdic assessment scorecard 

the fdia creates a depositor preference regime for the resolution of all insured depository institutions including the bank if any such institution is placed into receivership the fdic will pay out of the remaining net assets of the failed institution and only to the extent of such assets first secured creditors to the extent of their security second the administrative expenses of the receivership third all deposits liabilities both insured and uninsured fourth any other general or senior liabilities fifth any obligations subordinated to depositors or general creditors and finally any remaining net assets to shareholders in that capacity 

the bank may be held liable by the fdic for any loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the dif due to the default of another commonly controlled fdicinsured institution or for any assistance provided by the fdic to another commonly controlled fdicinsured institution that is in danger of default as long as we are directly or indirectly controlled by ge the bank will be commonly controlled with another fdicinsured institution ge capital bank an industrial bank chartered under the laws of utah 

consumer financial services regulation 

the relationship between us and our us customers is regulated extensively under federal and state consumer protection laws federal laws include the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act hola the fair credit reporting act the “fcra” the grammleachbliley act the “glba” the card act and the doddfrank act these and other federal laws among other things require disclosures of the cost of credit provide substantive consumer rights prohibit discrimination in credit transactions regulate the use of credit report information provide financial privacy protections require safe and sound banking operations prohibit unfair deceptive and abusive practices restrict our ability to raise interest rates and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight state and in some cases local laws also may regulate the relationship between us and our us customers in these areas as well as in the areas of collection practices and may provide other additional consumer protections moreover we and our us subsidiaries are subject to the servicemembers civil relief act which protects persons called to active military service and their dependents from undue hardship resulting from their military service the servicemembers civil relief act applies to all debts incurred prior to the commencement of active duty including credit card and other openend debt and limits the amount of interest including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges other than bona fide insurance that is related to the obligation or liability 

violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers including actual damages restitution and attorneys’ fees federal banking regulators as well as state attorneys general and other state and local consumer protection agencies also may seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies including civil money penalties and fines 

the card act was enacted in 2009 and most of the requirements became effective in 2010 the card act made numerous amendments to the truth in lending act requiring us to make significant changes to many of our business practices including marketing underwriting pricing and billing the card act’s restrictions on our ability to increase interest rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and credit risk ultimately limits our ability to extend credit to new customers and provide additional credit to current customers other card act restrictions such as limitations on late fees have resulted and will continue to result in reduced interest income and loan fee income 

the fcra regulates the bank’s and our use of credit reports and the reporting of information to credit reporting agencies and also provides a standard for lenders to share information with affiliates and certain third parties and to provide firm offers of credit to consumers the fcra also places further restrictions on the use of information shared between affiliates for marketing purposes requires the provision of disclosures to consumers when riskbased pricing is used in a credit decision and requires safeguards to help protect consumers from identity theft 

under hola the bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers in general the bank may not extend credit lease or sell property or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that i the customer obtain or provide some additional credit property or services from or to the bank or synchrony or their subsidiaries or ii the customer may not obtain some other credit property or services from a competitor except in each case to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended certain arrangements are permissible for example the bank may offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products 

the durbin amendment in the doddfrank act requires the federal reserve board to promulgate certain rules related to debit transaction interchange fees on june 29 2011 the federal reserve board adopted a final rule with respect to the durbin amendment effective on october 1 2011 which among other things established a regulatory cap for many types of debit interchange transactions that is no more than 21 cents plus five basis points of the value of the transaction the federal reserve board’s rule also allows a debit card issuer to recover 1 per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraudrelated requirements in addition the rule prohibits the imposition of restrictions on a merchant’s ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over a network for which the issuer has enabled processing these rules were challenged by retailers claiming that the interchange fee and network nonexclusivity provisions of the rule are arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion and otherwise not in accordance with the law the federal reserve board’s regulation was upheld by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit on march 21 2014 the court of appeals found that the federal reserve board’s final rule was based on a reasonable interpretation of the doddfrank act the court of appeals remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion and those lower court proceedings are ongoing the retailers petitioned the us supreme court for a review of the decision of the court of appeals which petition was denied on january 20 2015 

the doddfrank act established the cfpb which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair transparent and competitive the cfpb has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the doddfrank act and other federal consumer financial services laws as well as broad supervisory examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services such as us in addition the cfpb has an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the products we offer the system could inform future agency decisions with respect to regulatory enforcement or examination focus there continues to be uncertainty as to how the cfpb’s strategies and priorities will have an impact on our businesses and our results of operations going forward although we have been subject to various matters with the cfpb as described below neither the company nor the bank has had its first comprehensive examination by the cfpb and we cannot predict when such examination will occur or what the results will be see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—the consumer financial protection bureau is a new agency and there continues to be uncertainty as to how the agency’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business ” 

in july 2012 the cfpb issued an industry bulletin regarding marketing practices with respect to credit card addon products including debt cancellation products the bank has made a number of changes including changes in response to the cfpb bulletin with respect to its marketing and sale of debt cancellation products to credit card customers including ceasing all telesales of such products and the bank has also enhanced the disclosures associated with its website sales of such products see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to our business—litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses ” 

in october 2013 the cfpb published its first biennial report reviewing the impact of the card act on the consumer credit card market in the report the cfpb identified practices that may warrant further scrutiny by it including addon products such as debt protection identity theft protection credit score monitoring and other products that are supplementary to the extension of credit cards that charge substantial application fees and deferred interest offers and products which could include our promotional financing products the report further identified concerns regarding the adequacy of online disclosures as well as of the disclosures associated with rewards products and grace periods separately the cfpb is also studying predispute arbitration clauses and our litigation exposure could increase if the cfpb exercises its authority to limit or ban predispute arbitration clauses 

on december 10 2013 we entered into a consent order with the cfpb relating to our carecredit platform the “2013 cfpb consent order” which requires us to pay up to 341 million to customers to provide additional training and monitoring of our carecredit partners to include provisions in agreements with our carecredit partners prohibiting charges for certain services not yet rendered to make changes to certain consumer disclosures application procedures and procedures for resolution of customer complaints and to terminate carecredit partners that have chargeback rates in excess of certain thresholds some of the changes required by the 2013 cfpb consent order are similar to requirements in an assurance of discontinuation that we entered with the attorney general for the state of new york on june 3 2013 the “assurance” we believe the bank is in substantial compliance with the material business practice changes required by the 2013 cfpb consent order and the assurance subject to ongoing reporting obligations and will complete the additional provider training by the fourth quarter of 2015 in addition to the costs of remediation which were not material for the assurance and will be up to 341 million for the 2013 cfpb consent order the company will incur onetime costs of approximately 3 million to implement these changes and estimates ongoing annual costs of approximately 3 million although we continue to actively monitor and assess the impact on our carecredit program of the changes required by the 2013 cfpb consent order and the assurance some of which have only recently been implemented including the impact on program usage as providers become acclimated to the required changes we do not believe that the 2013 cfpb consent order or the assurance will have a material impact on our results of operations going forward see “ item 1a risk factors—risks relation to regulation—changes to our methods of offering our carecredit products could materially impact operating results ” 

on june 19 2014 we entered into a consent order with the cfpb the “2014 cfpb consent order” that requires us to refund 56 million to cardholders who enrolled in a debt cancellation product over the telephone from january 2010 to october 2012 11 million of which was refunded prior to the 2014 cfpb consent order pay civil money penalties of 35 million and implement a compliance plan related to the sale of “addon” products to the extent the bank restarts telesales of such products which were discontinued in october 2012 

in addition to resolving the cfpb’s concerns regarding our debt cancellation sales practices the 2014 cfpb consent order resolved an unrelated issue that arose from the bank’s selfidentified omission of certain spanishspeaking customers and customers residing in puerto rico from two offers that were made to certain delinquent customers we discovered this issue through an audit of our collection operations in 2012 reported it to the cfpb and initiated a voluntary remediation program which resulted in payments balance credits and balance waivers of 132 million the cfpb conducted a review of the collection offer omissions and also referred the matter to the doj which commenced an investigation in march 2014 at the same time we entered into the 2014 cfpb consent order we entered into a consent order with the doj the “2014 doj consent order” and together with the 2014 cfpb consent order the “2014 consent orders” to settle a complaint filed by the doj on june 19 2014 in the united states district court for the district of utah alleging claims under the equal credit opportunity act related to our collections offer omissions the 2014 doj consent order is subject to court approval which was received on june 26 2014 the 2014 doj consent order is similar to the 2014 cfpb consent order and does not impose any additional requirements on us the 2014 consent orders require us to complete our remediation program by providing additional payments balance credits and balance waivers of 37 million and to update our credit bureau reporting relating to the affected accounts in the fourth quarter of 2014 we determined that our remediation program will require us to provide approximately 38 million in additional remediation approximately 32 million of which consists of balance credits and waivers to previously chargedoff accounts of the approximately 207 million in total consumer remediation including the 132 million completed prior to the 2014 consent orders and the 75 million that remains to be completed approximately 190 million consists of balance credits and waivers to previously chargedoff accounts in addition to consumer remediation the 2014 consent orders require us to implement a fair lending compliance plan including fair lending reviews audits and training which will in part be satisfied by our existing compliance processes although we do not believe that the 2014 consent orders themselves will have a material adverse effect on results of operations going forward we cannot be sure whether the settlement will have an adverse impact on our reputation or whether any similar actions will be brought by state attorneys general or others all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

gecc’s regulatory status 

gecc is a regulated savings and loan holding company and therefore is subject to all of the regulatory obligations to which we are subject until the ge slhc deregistration gecc’s regulatory obligations as a savings and loan holding company may for reasons related or unrelated to us materially and adversely affect us including restricting our ability to initiate pay dividends or repurchase stock or continue various business activities or practices 

as a nonbank sifi gecc is subject to enhanced prudential standards under the doddfrank act and regulation by the federal reserve board nonbank sifis such as gecc currently are subject to some but not all of the enhanced prudential standards under the doddfrank act such as resolution planning the federal reserve board has also proposed to apply other enhanced prudential standards to gecc by order if adopted as proposed these standards are expected to include among other things enhanced board and risk governance enhanced capital and liquidity levels compliance with capital planning and stresstesting requirements and market terms requirements for intercompany transactions although the enhanced prudential standards currently applicable to gecc in its capacity as a nonbank sifi do not have the effect of imposing direct regulatory obligations on us we cannot be certain that standards imposed in the future by the federal reserve board on gecc as a nonbank sifi will not have the effect of directly or indirectly imposing obligations or restrictions on us so long as we are controlled by gecc for bank regulatory purposes see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—as long as we are controlled by gecc for bank regulatory purposes regulation and supervision of gecc could adversely affect us ”

ge transfer of unrelated bank 

as part of the separation assuming it is accomplished by the splitoff ge intends to transfer ownership of ge capital bank a bank that is and will be separate from and unrelated to synchrony and the bank from one of its subsidiaries to another ge has indicated to us that it does not believe that this transfer requires an application to or an approval or nonobjection by any bank regulatory authorities however if those authorities disagree and were to require an application or other opportunity for approval or nonobjection we cannot predict what action the authorities might take on such an application or notice or what conditions or restrictions if any the regulators might impose in connection with any such action any such action or any conditions or restrictions in connection with such action could have a material adverse effect on ge’s ability to retain that bank and could affect ge’s willingness to proceed with the separation as currently planned

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in “ item 1 business ” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with “ item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” mda and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in “ item 8 financial statements and supplementary data ” of this form 10k report 

our businesses routinely encounter and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we anticipate discussion about important operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in the business descriptions in “ item 1 business ” and the mda section of this form 10k report below we describe certain important strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments will affect our future results 

risks relating to our businesses 

 

macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

key macroeconomic conditions historically have affected our business results of operations and financial condition and are likely to affect them in the future consumer confidence unemployment and housing indicators are among the factors that often impact consumer spending behavior poor economic conditions reduce the usage of our credit cards and other financing products and the average purchase amount of transactions on our credit cards and through our other products which in each case reduces our interest and fee income we rely primarily on interest and fee income to generate our net earnings our interest and fee income was 122 billion  and 113 billion for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively poor economic conditions also adversely affect the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us increasing delinquencies bankruptcies chargeoffs and allowances for loan losses and decreasing recoveries for example our over30 day delinquency rate as a percentage of periodend loan receivables was 825 at december 31 2009 during the financial crisis compared to 414  at december 31 2014 and our fullyear net chargeoff rate was 1126 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 451  for the year ended december 31 2014 we believe the delinquency rate in our portfolio is at historically low levels and chargeoff rates in our portfolio are back to prerecession levels and they both may increase and are likely to increase materially if economic conditions deteriorate 

while certain economic conditions in the united states have shown signs of improvement economic growth has been slow and uneven as consumers continue to recover from previously high unemployment rates lower housing values concerns about the level of us government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address this as well as economic and political conditions in the global markets a prolonged period of slow economic growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions would likely affect consumer spending levels and the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

macroeconomic conditions may also cause net earnings to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of securities analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding the impact of these conditions on our business and this may adversely impact our stock price 

our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners 

substantially all of our revenue is generated from the credit products we provide to customers of our partners pursuant to program agreements we enter into with our partners as a result our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners historically there has been turnover in our partners and we expect this will continue in the future for example five programs previously identified as among our 40 largest program agreements measured by platform revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 have been sold or otherwise will not be extended beyond their contractual expiration dates in 2015 these five  program agreements represented in the aggregate 30  of our total platform revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 10  of our total loan receivables including loan receivables held for sale at december 31 2014 in addition we recently extended our program agreement with paypal one of our ten largest partners until october 2016 and do not expect it to extend beyond that date 

program agreements with our retail card partners and national and regional retailer and manufacturer payment solutions partners typically are for multiyear terms these program agreements generally permit our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons including in some cases if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria we fail to achieve certain targets with respect to approvals of new customers as a result of the credit criteria we use we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds or we are not adequately capitalized or certain force majeure events or changes in our ownership occur or a material adverse change in our financial condition occurs a few payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer and manufacturer partners also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us eg several months in addition programs with manufacturers buying groups and industry associations generally are made available to payment solutions partners such as individual retail outlets dealers and merchants under dealer agreements which typically may be terminated at will by the partner on short notice to us eg 15 days 

there is significant competition for our existing partners and our failure to retain our existing larger partner relationships upon the expiration or our earlier loss of a relationship upon the exercise of a partner’s early termination rights or the expiration or termination of a substantial number of smaller partner relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including growth rates and financial condition to the extent we do not acquire new partners of similar size and profitability or otherwise grow our business the competition for new partners is also significant and our failure to attract new partners could adversely affect our ability to grow 

a significant percentage of our platform revenue comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our ten largest partner relationships are with retail card partners and accounted for an aggregate of 598  of our total platform revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 our five largest programs gap jcpenney lowe’s sam’s club and walmart accounted in aggregate for 471 of our total platform revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 sam’s club is a subsidiary of walmart that is a separate contracting entity with its own program agreement with us our programs with jcpenney and walmart each accounted for more than 10 of our total platform revenue over the same period we expect to have significant concentration in our largest relationships for the foreseeable future 

the program agreements generally permit us or our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date under various circumstances as described in the preceding risk factor some of our program agreements also provide that upon expiration or termination our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loans generated with respect to its program and all related customer data the loss of any of our largest partners or a material reduction in the interest and fees we receive from their customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results depend to a significant extent on the active and effective promotion and support of our products by our partners 

our partners generally accept most major credit cards and various other forms of payment and therefore our success depends on their active and effective promotion of our products to their customers we depend on our partners to integrate the use of our credit products into their store culture by training their sales associates about our products having their sales associates encourage their customers to apply for and use our products and otherwise effectively marketing our products in addition although our retail card programs and our payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer partners typically are exclusive with respect to the credit products we offer at that partner some payment solutions programs and most carecredit provider relationships are not exclusive to us and therefore a partner may choose to promote a competitor’s financing over ours depending upon cost availability or attractiveness to consumers or other factors typically we do not have or utilize any recourse against these nonexclusive partners when they do not sufficiently promote our products partners may also implement or fail to implement changes in their systems and technologies that may disrupt the integration between their systems and technologies and ours which could disrupt the use of our products the failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as changes they may make in their business models that negatively impact card usage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition if our partners engage in improper business practices do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements or other contractual arrangements or standards or otherwise diminish the value of our brand we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our results are impacted to a significant extent by the financial performance of our partners 

our ability to generate new loans and the interest and fees and other income associated with them is dependent upon sales of merchandise and services by our partners the retail and healthcare industries in which our partners operate are intensely competitive our partners compete with retailers and department stores in their own geographic areas as well as catalog and internet sales businesses our partners in the healthcare industry compete with other healthcare providers our partners’ sales may decrease or may not increase as we anticipate for various reasons some of which are in the partners’ control and some of which are not for example partner sales may be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions having a national regional or more local effect on consumer spending business conditions affecting a particular partner or industry or catastrophes affecting broad or more discrete geographic areas if our partners’ sales decline for any reason it generally results in lower credit sales and therefore lower loan volume and associated interest and fees and other income for us from their customers in addition if a partner closes some or all of its stores or becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding or if there is a perception that it may become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding its customers who have used our financing products may have less incentive to pay their outstanding balances to us which could result in higher chargeoff rates than anticipated and our costs for servicing its customers’ accounts may increase this risk is particularly acute with respect to our largest partners that account for a significant amount of our platform revenue see “ —a significant percentage of our platform revenue comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations ” moreover if the financial condition of a partner deteriorates significantly or a partner becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding we may not be able to recover for customer returns customer payments made in partner stores or other amounts due to us from the partner a decrease in sales by our partners for any reason or a bankruptcy proceeding involving any of them could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we will need additional financing and our borrowing costs are higher following the ipo adverse financial market conditions or our inability to effectively manage our funding and liquidity risk could have a material adverse effect on our funding liquidity and ability to meet our obligations 

we need to effectively manage our funding and liquidity in order to meet our cash requirements such as day to day operating expenses extensions of credit to our customers payments of principal and interest on our borrowings and payments on our other obligations historically our primary sources of funding and liquidity have been and following the ipo continue to be collections from our customers deposits funds from securitized financings and proceeds from unsecured borrowings prior to the ipo our unsecured borrowings came from gecc and we believe our affiliation with ge made it easier and less expensive for us to obtain some of our funding from third parties in the future we do not expect to receive funding from gecc other than transitional financing from the gecc term loan and expect our borrowing costs from third parties will be higher than our historical costs from gecc in addition as a result of the ipo it may be more difficult for us to securitize our loans because our credit ratings from the rating agencies are lower than gecc’s current credit ratings which may cause investors and the credit rating agencies to view us as a weaker sponsor to compensate our recent issuances of assetbacked securities have required and future issuances likely will require additional credit enhancements and may require higher interest rates and even then the credit ratings on our assetbacked securities may be lower than they have been historically in addition to maintain the current credit ratings of certain of our existing assetbacked securities in light of the ipo we have amended the documentation for those securities to require us to maintain additional collateral in the form of additional loan receivables for those securities these factors and actions may increase the costs of securitizing our loans relative to our historical costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial flexibility 

if we do not have sufficient liquidity we may not be able to meet our obligations particularly during a liquidity stress event if we maintain or are required to maintain too much liquidity it could be costly and reduce our financial flexibility 

we will need additional financing in the future to refinance any existing debt including the expected prepayment of part or substantially all of the outstanding debt under the gecc term loan in connection with our application to the federal reserve board and the separation and finance growth of our business the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as financial market conditions generally including the availability of credit to the financial services industry consumers’ willingness to place money on deposit in the bank our performance and credit ratings and the performance of our securitized portfolios disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital credit or deposit markets such as the uncertainty and volatility experienced in the capital and credit markets during the financial crisis and more recently arising from the sovereign debt crisis in europe and other economic and political conditions in the global markets and concerning the level of us government debt and fiscal measures that may be taken over the longer term to address these matters may limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance maturing liabilities on desired terms including funding costs in a timely manner or at all it may also be more difficult or costly for us to obtain funds following the separation as a result we may be forced to delay obtaining funding or be forced to issue or raise funding on undesirable terms which could significantly reduce our financial flexibility and cause us to contract or not grow our business all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions 

in addition at december 31 2014 we had an aggregate of 61 billion  of undrawn committed capacity from private lenders under two of our existing securitization programs our ability to draw on such commitments is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including the applicable securitization trust having sufficient collateral to support the assetbacked securities issuance and the absence of an early amortization event moreover there are regulatory reforms that have recently been proposed or adopted in the united states and internationally that are intended to address certain issues that affected banks in the recent financial crisis these reforms generally referred to as “basel iii” subject banks to more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements to the extent that the basel iii requirements result in increased costs to the banks providing undrawn committed capacity under our securitization programs these costs are likely to be passed on to us in addition in response to basel iii some banks in the market including certain of the private lenders in our securitization programs have added provisions to their credit agreements permitting them to delay disbursement of funding requests for 30 days or more if our bank lenders require delayed disbursements of funding andor higher pricing for committing undrawn capacity to us our cost of funding and access to liquidity could be adversely affected 

while financial market conditions have generally stabilized and improved since the financial crisis there can be no assurance that significant disruptions uncertainties and volatility will not occur in the future if we are unable to continue to finance our business access capital markets and attract deposits on favorable terms and in a timely manner or if we experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

a reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

our senior unsecured debt currently is rated bbb stable outlook by fitch ratings inc “fitch” and bbb stable outlook by standard  poor’s “sp” although we have not requested that moody’s investor services inc “moody’s” provide a rating for our senior unsecured debt we believe that if moody’s were to issue a rating on our unsecured debt its rating would be lower than the comparable ratings issued by fitch and sp the ratings for our unsecured debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors that may not be within our control such as macroeconomic conditions and the rating agencies’ perception of the industries in which we operate and the products we offer as a result of the ipo our unsecured debt credit rating from the rating agencies is lower than gecc’s current unsecured debt credit rating the ratings of our assetbacked securities are and will continue to be based on a number of factors including the quality of the underlying loans and the credit enhancement structure with respect to each series of assetbacked securities as well as the credit rating of gecc as the servicer of our publicly registered securitization trust and our credit rating as sponsor these ratings also reflect the various methodologies and assumptions used by the rating agencies which are subject to change and could adversely affect our ratings the rating agencies regularly evaluate our credit ratings and those of gecc as well as the credit ratings of our assetbacked securities we expect gecc will resign and assign its servicing obligations for our publicly registered securitization trust to us and we have amended the program documents for this trust to enable that assignment we expect the gecc resignation and assignment will occur on the earlier of i the date all assetbacked securities outstanding at the effective time of the amendment have been redeemed or paid in full which is expected to occur no later than 2019 and ii when the holders of such securities have consented to an assignment of such servicing obligations to us the “expected gecc servicer assignment date” there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our unsecured debt or assetbacked securities credit ratings or that any of our credit ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn in the future including as ge decreases its ownership in us or when gecc is no longer the servicer we also cannot be sure that gecc’s credit ratings will not be lowered or what impact any such action would have on our credit ratings as well as those of our assetbacked securities a downgrade in our unsecured debt or assetbacked securities credit ratings or investor concerns that a downgrade may occur could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

if the ratings on our assetbacked securities are reduced put on negative watch or withdrawn as a result of the ipo the separation the ge slhc deregistration or otherwise it may have an adverse effect on the liquidity or the market price of our assetbacked securities and on the cost of or our ability to continue using securitized financings to the extent anticipated 

our inability to securitize our loans would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition 

we use the securitization of loans which involves the transfer of loans to a trust and the issuance by the trust of assetbacked securities to thirdparty investors as a significant source of funding our average level of securitized financings from third parties was 148 billion  and 162 billion  for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively for a discussion of our securitization activities see “ item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—funding liquidity and capital resources—funding sources—securitized financings ” and note 6 variable interest entities  to our consolidated and combined financial statements 

although the securitization market for credit cards has been reestablished since the financial crisis that began in 2008 there can be no assurance that the market will not experience future disruptions the extent to which we will securitize our loans in the future will depend in part upon the conditions in the securities markets in general and the credit card assetbacked securities market in particular the overall credit quality of our loans and the conformity of the loans and our securitization program to rating agency requirements the costs of securitizing our loans and the legal regulatory accounting and tax requirements governing securitization transactions in the event we are unable to refinance existing assetbacked securities from our publicly registered securitization trust with new securities from the same trust there are structural and regulatory constraints on our ability to refinance these assetbacked securities with bank deposits or other funding at the bank and therefore we would be required to rely on sources outside of the bank which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost a prolonged inability to securitize our loans on favorable terms or at all or to refinance our assetbacked securities would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition 

the occurrence of an early amortization of our securitization facilities would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds 

our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events resulting in the early amortization of our existing securitized financings during an early amortization period principal collections from the loans in our assetbacked securitization trusts would be applied to repay principal of the assetbacked securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund purchases of newly originated loans this would negatively impact our liquidity including our ability to originate new loans under existing accounts and require us to rely on alternative funding sources which might increase our funding costs or might not be available when needed 

our loss of the right to service or subservice our securitized loans would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds 

gecc currently acts as servicer with respect to our publicly registered securitization trust and its related series of assetbacked securities and the bank acts as servicer with respect to our other two securitization trusts if gecc or the bank as applicable defaults in its servicing obligations an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant assetbacked securities andor gecc or the bank as applicable could be replaced as servicer servicer defaults include for example the failure of the servicer to make any payment transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents a breach of representations warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents the delegation of the servicer’s duties contrary to the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer such an amortization event would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor 

we expect gecc will resign and assign its servicing obligations for our publicly registered securitization trust to us on or shortly after the expected gecc servicer assignment date and until that time our ability to service the public securitization trust’s assets pursuant to the subservicing arrangement with gecc will be dependent on gecc not being terminated as servicer for a servicer default or resigning in accordance with the requirements specified in the trust’s program documents as well as us not being terminated for a default under our subservicing arrangement with gecc if gecc defaults or resigns or if we default under our subservicing arrangement a third party could be appointed servicer with respect to our publicly registered securitization trust particularly if neither we nor the bank have the required ratings to serve as successor servicer similarly if we default in our servicing obligations with respect to either of our other two securitization trusts a third party could be appointed as servicer of the related trust if a thirdparty servicer is appointed there is no assurance that the thirdparty will engage us as subservicer in which event we would no longer be able to control the manner in which the related trust’s assets are serviced and the failure of a third party to appropriately service such assets could lead to an early amortization event in the affected securitization trust which would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor 

lower payment rates on our securitized loans could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

certain collections from our securitized loans come back to us through our subsidiaries and we use these collections to fund our purchase of newly originated loans to collateralize our securitized financings if payment rates on our securitized loans are lower than they have historically been fewer collections will be remitted to us on an ongoing basis further certain series of our assetbacked securities include a requirement that we accumulate principal collections in a restricted account for a specified number of months prior to the applicable security’s maturity date we are required under the program documents to lengthen this accumulation period to the extent we expect the payment rates to be low enough that the current length of the accumulation period is inadequate to fully fund the restricted account by the applicable security’s maturity date lower payment rates and in particular payment rates that are low enough that we are required to lengthen our accumulation periods could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

our inability to grow our deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to grow our business 

we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers or through brokerage firms that offer our deposit products to their customers at december 31 2014 we had 197 billion  in direct deposits which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions and 153 billion  in deposits originated through brokerage firms including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger who channels brokerage account deposits to us a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to significantly expand our direct deposits although we expect to reduce the proportion of our funding provided by brokered deposits in connection with our application to the federal reserve board we also intend to continue to rely on brokered deposits as a source of funding 

the deposit business is highly competitive with intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits we compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits features and benefits of our products the quality of our customer service and the competitiveness of our digital banking capabilities our ability to originate and maintain retail deposits is also highly dependent on the strength of the bank and the perceptions of consumers and others of our business practices and our financial health adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to difficulties in attracting and retaining deposits accounts negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas including lending practices regulatory compliance inadequate protection of customer information or sales and marketing activities and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct in addition our ability to originate and maintain deposits could be adversely affected by the loss of our association with ge’s brand and reputation as a result of the separation 

the demand for the deposit products we offer may also be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns changes in customer preferences reductions in consumers’ disposable income regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products competition from other financial services firms and others that use deposit funding products may affect deposit renewal rates costs or availability changes we make to the rates offered on our deposit products may affect our profitability and liquidity 

the fdia prohibits an insured bank from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is “well capitalized” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is “adequately capitalized” and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates there are no such restrictions under the fdia on a bank that is “well capitalized” and at december 31 2014 the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed “well capitalized” for purposes of the fdia however there can be no assurance that the bank will continue to meet those requirements limitations on the bank’s ability to accept brokered deposits for any reason including regulatory limitations on the amount of brokered deposits in total or as a percentage of total assets in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity any limitation on the interest rates the bank can pay on deposits could competitively disadvantage us in attracting and retaining deposits and have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings funding and liquidity 

changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income and our interest expense to increase or decrease as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks at december 31 2014 568  of our loan receivables bore a fixed interest rate to the customer and we generally fund these assets with fixed rate certificates of deposit securitized financing and unsecured debt at december 31 2014 432  of our loan receivables bore a floating interest rate to the customer and we generally fund these assets with floating rate deposits assetbacked securities and unsecured debt the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is the prime rate and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the federal funds rate the prime rate and libor or the federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities to the extent we are unable to effectively match the interest rates on our assets and liabilities including in the future potentially through the use of derivatives our net earnings could be materially adversely affected 

competitive and regulatory factors may limit our ability to raise interest rates fixed or floating on our loans in addition some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers under those agreements if interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner or at all our net interest margin could be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay amounts owed to us our floating rate credit products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies bankruptcies chargeoffs and allowances for loan losses and decreasing recoveries all of which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity 

we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our net earnings of various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our net earnings and could also increase our funding costs and reduce our liquidity especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different from those we assumed for a discussion of interest rate risk sensitivities see “ item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—interest rate risk ” 

our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective in mitigating our risks 

our risk management processes and procedures seek to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate risks we have established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor and control the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk liquidity risk strategic risk and operational risk credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation we are exposed to both consumer credit risk from our customer loans and institutional credit risk principally from our partners market risk is the risk of loss due to changes in external market factors such as interest rates liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet obligations and support business growth strategic risk is the risk from changes in the business environment improper implementation of decisions or inadequate responsiveness to changes in the business environment operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes people or systems external events ie natural disasters or compliance reputational or legal matters and includes those risks as they relate directly to our company as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business see “ item 1 business—credit risk management ” and “ risk management ” for additional information on the types of risks affecting our business 

we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework that includes our risk appetite statement enterprise risk assessment process risk policies procedures and controls reporting requirements credit risk culture and governance structure management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models if the models that we use to manage these risks are ineffective at predicting future losses or are otherwise inadequate we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected in addition the information we use in managing our credit and other risk may be inaccurate or incomplete as a result of error or fraud both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid there may also be risks that exist or that develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated including when processes are changed or new products and services are introduced if our risk management framework does not effectively identify and control our risks we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected and that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business and if they are not accurate or are misinterpreted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business including liquidity and capital planning including stress testing customer selection credit and other risk management pricing reserving and collections management the models may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect for a variety of reasons including as a result of errors in constructing interpreting or using the models or the use of inaccurate assumptions including failures to update assumptions appropriately or in a timely manner our assumptions may be inaccurate for many reasons including that they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and beyond our control eg macroeconomic conditions and their impact on partner and customer behaviors and they often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables factors and other assumptions the errors or inaccuracies in our models may be material and could lead us to make wrong or suboptimal decisions in managing our business and this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business depends on our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and failing to do so may result in high chargeoff rates 

our success depends on our ability to manage our credit risk while attracting new customers with profitable usage patterns we select our customers manage their accounts and establish terms and credit limits using proprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques that are designed to set terms and credit limits to appropriately compensate us for the credit risk we accept while encouraging customers to use their available credit the models and approaches we use to manage our credit risk may not accurately predict future chargeoffs for various reasons discussed in the preceding risk factor 

our ability to manage credit risk and avoid high chargeoff rates also may be adversely affected by economic conditions that may be difficult to predict such as the recent financial crisis although delinquencies and chargeoffs continued to decline through 2014 they both may increase in the future and are likely to increase materially if economic conditions deteriorate we remain subject to conditions in the consumer credit environment there can be no assurance that our credit underwriting and risk management strategies will enable us to avoid high chargeoff levels or delinquencies or that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover actual losses 

a customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders under mortgage credit card and other loans including student loans these changes can result from increases in base lending rates or structured increases in payment obligations and could reduce the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations to other lenders and to us in addition a customer’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by the restricted availability of credit to consumers generally including reduced and closed lines of credit customers with insufficient cash flow to fund daily living expenses and lack of access to other sources of credit may be more likely to increase their card usage and ultimately default on their payment obligations to us resulting in higher credit losses in our portfolio our collection operations may not compete effectively to secure more of customers’ diminished cash flow than our competitors in addition we may not identify customers who are likely to default on their payment obligations to us and reduce our exposure by closing credit lines and restricting authorizations quickly enough which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition at december 31 2014 278 of our portfolio’s loan receivables including loan receivables held for sale were from consumers with a fico score of 660 or less who typically have higher delinquency and credits losses than consumers with higher fico scores 

our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations and collection regulations competitors’ actions and consumer behavior as well as inadequate collections staffing techniques models and performance of vendors such as collection agencies 

our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to cover losses on our loans 

we maintain an allowance for loan losses a reserve established through a provision for losses charged to expense that we believe is appropriate to provide for incurred losses in our loan portfolio in addition for portfolios we may acquire when we enter into new partner program agreements any deterioration in the performance of the purchased portfolios after acquisition results in incremental loss reserves growth in our loan portfolio generally would lead to an increase in the allowance for loan losses 

the process for establishing an allowance for loan losses is critical to our results of operations and financial condition and requires complex models and judgments including forecasts of economic conditions changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding our loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses we may underestimate our incurred losses and fail to maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to account for these losses in cases where we modify a loan if the modified loans do not perform as anticipated we may be required to establish additional allowances on these loans 

we periodically review and update our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to establish our allowance for loan losses to reflect our view of current conditions moreover our regulators as part of their supervisory function periodically review the methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use for calculating and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses our regulators based on their judgment may conclude that we should modify our methodology models or the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments increase our allowance for loan losses andor recognize further losses during 2012 and 2013 we enhanced our allowance for loan losses methodology this enhancement resulted in a more granular portfolio segmentation analysis by loss type included a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the portfolio’s allowance for loan losses which compared the allowance for losses to projected net chargeoffs over the next 12 months in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance and was designed to provide a better estimate of the date of a probable loss event and length of time required for a probable loss event to result in a chargeoff as a result we recognized incremental provisions of 343 million and 642 million in 2012 and 2013 respectively we continue to review and evaluate our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use and we will implement further enhancements or changes to them as needed we cannot assure you that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses future increases in the allowance for loan losses or recognized losses as a result of any review update regulatory guidance or otherwise will result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements are incorrect or are required to change our reported results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are required to make various assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements under gaap including for purposes of determining allowances for loan losses asset impairment reserves related to litigation and other legal matters valuation of income and other taxes and regulatory exposures and the amounts recorded for certain contractual payments to be paid to or received from partners and others under contractual arrangements in addition significant assumptions and estimates are involved in determining certain disclosures required under gaap including those involving the fair value of our financial instruments if the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect the actual amounts realized on transactions and balances subject to those estimates will be different and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently reviewing or proposing changes to several financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of our financial statements including the proposed standard on accounting for credit losses and other areas where assumptions or estimates are required as a result of changes to financial accounting or reporting standards whether promulgated or required by the fasb or other regulators we could be required to change certain of the assumptions or estimates we previously used in preparing our financial statements which could materially impact how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition generally for additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements see “ item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting estimates ” and note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated and combined financial statements 

we may not be able to offset increases in our costs with decreased payments under our retailer share arrangements which could reduce our profitability 

most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the relevant program exceeds a contractually defined threshold although the share arrangements vary by partner these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program based typically on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold however because the threshold and the economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on among other things agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses we may not be able to pass on increases in our actual expenses such as funding costs or operating expenses in the form of reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements and our economic return on a program could be adversely affected 

competition in the consumer finance industry is intense 

the success of our business depends on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners the competition for partners is intense and becoming more competitive our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as alliance data american express capital one chase citibank td bank and wells fargo and to a lesser extent potential partners’ own inhouse financing capabilities some of our competitors are substantially larger have substantially greater resources and may offer a broader range of products and services we compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors including program financial and other terms underwriting standards marketing expertise service levels product and service offerings including incentive and loyalty programs technological capabilities and integration brand and reputation in addition some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting eg new account approval customer service and collections and other core banking responsibilities that we retain but some partners may prefer to handle as a result of competition we may be unable to acquire new partners lose existing relationships to competing companies or find it more costly to maintain our existing relationships 

our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain customers and generate usage of our products by them the consumer credit and payments industry is highly competitive and we face an increasingly dynamic industry as emerging technologies enter the marketplace as a form of payment our products compete with cash checks debit cards general purpose credit cards including visa and mastercard american express and discover card other privatelabel card brands and to a certain extent prepaid cards we also compete with nontraditional providers such as paypal in the future we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies such as apple pay google wallet softcard and square as well as consortia of merchants that are expected to combine payment systems to reduce interchange and other costs eg currentc to the extent that our products are not accepted in or compatible with such technologies we may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry we compete for customers and their usage of our products and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances based on a number of factors including pricing interest rates and fees product offerings credit limits incentives including loyalty programs and customer service although we offer a variety of consumer credit products some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services including home and automobile loans debit cards and bank branch atm access which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitors advantages including a more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers operational efficiencies more versatile technology platforms broadbased local distribution capabilities and lowercost funding in addition some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage customer attrition from any or all of our credit products or any lowering of the pricing of our products by reducing interest rates or fees in order to retain customers could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings 

in our retail deposits business we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct banking competitors we compete for deposits with traditional banks and in seeking to grow our direct banking business we compete with other banks that have direct banking models similar to ours such as ally financial american express capital one 360 ing discover nationwide sallie mae and usaa competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors 

if we are unable to compete effectively for partners customer usage or deposits our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in that market than a more diversified company 

our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit as a result we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular to us consumer credit than a more diversified company for example our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the us economy consumer spending and consumer credit we are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at consumer credit or the specific consumer credit products that we offer including promotional financing due to our carecredit platform we are also more susceptible to increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions targeted at elective healthcare related procedures or services in contrast to other industries our business concentration could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services 

our industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technologies products and services a key part of our financial success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services including with respect to loyalty programs mobile and point of sale technologies and new synchronybranded bank deposit and credit products realizing the benefits of those products and services is uncertain we may not assign the appropriate level of resources priority or expertise to the development and commercialization of these new products services or enhancements our ability to develop acquire or commercialize competitive technologies products or services on acceptable terms or at all may be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert in addition success is dependent on factors such as partner and customer acceptance adoption and usage competition the effectiveness of marketing programs the availability of appropriate technologies and business processes and regulatory approvals success of a new product service or enhancement also may depend upon our ability to deliver it on a large scale which may require a significant investment 

we also may select utilize and invest in technologies products and services that ultimately do not achieve widespread adoption and therefore are not as attractive or useful to our partners customers and service partners as we anticipate or partners may not recognize the value of our new products and services or believe they justify any potential costs or disruptions associated with implementing them in addition because our products and services typically are marketed through our partners if our partners are unwilling or unable to effectively implement our new technologies products services or enhancements we may be unable to grow our business competitors may also develop or adopt technologies or introduce innovations that change the markets we operate in and make our products less competitive and attractive to our partners and customers 

in any event we may not realize the benefit of new technologies products services or enhancements for many years or competitors may introduce more compelling products services or enhancements our failure to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products services or enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may not realize the value of strategic investments that we pursue and such investments could divert resources or introduce unforeseen risks to our business 

we may execute strategic acquisitions or partnerships or make other strategic investments in businesses products technologies or platforms to enhance or grow our business these strategic investments may introduce new costs or liabilities which could impact our ability to grow or maintain acceptable performance 

we may be unable to integrate systems personnel or technologies from our strategic investments these strategic investments may also present unforeseen legal regulatory or other challenges that we may not be able to manage effectively the planning and integration of an acquisition partnership or investment may shift employee time and other resources which could impair our ability to focus on our core business 

strategic investments may not perform as expected due to lack of acceptance by partners customers or employees higher than forecasted costs lengthy transition periods synergies or savings not being realized and a variety of other factors this may result in a delay or unrealized benefit or in some cases increased costs or other unforeseen risks to our business 

reductions in interchange fees may reduce the competitive advantages our private label credit card products currently have by virtue of not charging interchange fees and would reduce our income from those fees 

interchange is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the network’s infrastructure and payment facilitation and which are paid to credit card issuers to compensate them for the risk they bear in lending money to customers we earn interchange fees on dual card transactions but we do not charge or earn interchange fees from our partners or customers on our private label credit card products 

merchants trying to decrease their operating expenses have sought to and have had some success at lowering interchange rates several recent events and actions indicate a continuing increase in focus on interchange by both regulators and merchants beyond pursuing litigation legislation and regulation merchants are also pursuing alternate payment platforms as a means to lower payment processing costs to the extent interchange fees are reduced one of our current competitive advantages with our partners — that we typically do not charge interchange fees when our private label credit card products are used to purchase our partners’ goods and services — may be reduced moreover to the extent interchange fees are reduced our income from those fees will be lower we received approximately 389 million  and 324 million of interchange fees for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result a reduction in interchange fees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition for our dual cards we are subject to the operating regulations and procedures set forth by the interchange network and our failure to comply with these operating regulations which may change from time to time could subject us to various penalties or fees or the termination of our license to use the interchange network all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

fraudulent activity associated with our products and services could negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and cause the use of our products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase 

we are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with partners customers and third parties handling customer information our fraudrelated losses have increased significantly in recent years and were 154 million  134 million and 132 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our fraudrelated losses are due primarily to our dual card product which has grown in recent years and like the overall market for general purpose credit cards has experienced significant counterfeit and mailphone fraud including as a result of wellpublicized security breaches at retailers unrelated to us our private label credit card product is also susceptible to application fraud because among other things we provide immediate access to the credit line at the time of approval in addition sales on the internet and through mobile channels are becoming a larger part of our business and fraudulent activity is higher as a percentage of sales in those channels than in stores dual cards and private label credit cards are susceptible to different types of fraud and depending on our product channel mix including as a result of the introduction if any of a synchronybranded general purpose credit card we may continue to experience variations in or levels of fraudrelated expense that are different from or higher than that experienced by some of our competitors or the industry generally 

the risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry in general and credit card fraud identity theft and related crimes are likely to continue to be prevalent and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated our resources technologies and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud for example credit cards with emv chip technology such as “emv” chips provide additional security against fraudulent activity and have been widely adopted in europe and asia but merchants in the united states have been slower to adopt the technology as a result although we are in the process of rolling out this technology with several of our partners our credit cards continue to use the traditional magnetic stripes for card processing and therefore do not benefit from the embedded security chip feature and our adoption of this technology would still require wider acceptance by merchants to reduce our risk the level of our fraud chargeoffs and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to significantly increase high profile fraudulent activity also could negatively impact our brand and reputation which could negatively impact the use of our cards and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention such as increased customer notification requirements and mandatory issuance of cards with emv chips which could increase our costs and also negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and could lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk which could increase our costs 

cyberattacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our partners and our customers we also have arrangements in place with our partners and other third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business continuity programs our facilities and systems and those of our partners and thirdparty service providers are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events we and our partners and thirdparty service providers have experienced all of these events in the past and expect to continue to experience them in the future these events could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services although the impact to date from these events has not had a material adverse effect on us we cannot be sure this will be the case in the future 

information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies including mobile devices to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime perpetrators of fraud hackers terrorists and others in addition to cyberattacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions that are designed to disrupt key business services such as consumerfacing web sites the separation and our emergence as a separately branded company could increase our profile and therefore our risk of being targeted for cyberattacks and other security breaches including attacks targeting our key business services and websites we are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources we employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection 

we also face risks related to cyberattacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various thirdparties including our partners retailers that are not our partners where our dual cards are used merchant acquiring banks payment processors card networks eg visa and mastercard and our processors eg first data some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyberattacks and because the transactions involve thirdparties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure future security breaches or cyberattacks affecting any of these thirdparties could impact us through no fault of our own and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them we also rely on numerous other thirdparty service providers such as fis to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them while we regularly conduct security assessments of significant thirdparty service providers we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach 

the access by unauthorized persons to or the improper disclosure by us of confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information software methodologies and business secrets could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition recently there have been a number of wellpublicized attacks or breaches directed at others in our industry that have heightened concern by consumers generally about the security of using credit cards which have caused some consumers including our customers to use our credit cards less in favor of alternative methods of payment and has led to increased regulatory focus on and potentially new regulations relating to these matters further cyberattacks or other breaches in the future whether affecting us or others could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of our cards and increased costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the failure of third parties to provide various services that are important to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

some services important to our business are outsourced to thirdparty vendors for example our credit card transaction processing production and related services including the printing and mailing of customer statements are handled by first data and the technology platform for our online retail deposits is managed by fis first data and fis and in some cases other thirdparty vendors are the sole source or one of a limited number of sources of the services they provide for us it would be difficult and disruptive for us to replace some of our thirdparty vendors particularly first data and fis in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future as a result of their financial or business conditions or otherwise and our business and operations likely would be materially adversely affected first data has publicly disclosed that it is highly leveraged and that it has incurred net losses of 4578 million 8691 million and 7009 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our principal agreements with first data expire under their existing terms assuming we exercise our unilateral extension rights but the agreements are not otherwise renewed or extended by mutual agreement of the parties at various times between 2016 and 2020 our principal agreement with fis expires under its existing terms assuming we exercise our unilateral extension rights but the agreements are not otherwise renewed or extended by mutual agreement of the parties in 2020 in addition if a thirdparty provider fails to provide the services we require fails to meet contractual requirements such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations or suffers a cyberattack or other security breach our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

disruptions in the operation of our computer systems and data centers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ability to deliver products and services to our partners and our customers service our loans and otherwise operate our business and comply with applicable laws depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems and data centers as well as those of our partners and thirdparty service providers these computer systems and data centers may encounter service interruptions at any time due to system or software failure natural disaster or other reasons in addition the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain current and integrate new systems may also cause service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause our failure to comply with applicable laws all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in connection with the separation we must migrate and in some cases establish with third parties key parts of our technology infrastructure including our data centers as we migrate to our new data centers our partners need to make changes to their networks to establish connectivity with us these infrastructure changes both the ones that we make and the ones required of our partners may cause disruptions systems interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays in addition we have entered into transitional services arrangements with ge pursuant to which it will provide certain services to us relating to technology and business processes some of these transitional services arrangements may remain in effect until 2016 and during the transitional period we will rely on ge to provide these services the complexities of these arrangements and the services provided will increase the operational risk associated with the separation and this increased risk could result in unanticipated expenses disruptions to our operations or other adverse consequences all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer credit industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies and business processes may be better than those we currently use the pace of technology change is high and our industry is intensely competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete and better ones become available a failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less competitive all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have international operations that subject us to various international risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs 

we have international operations primarily in india the philippines and canada and some of our thirdparty service providers provide services to us from other countries all of which subject us to a number of international risks including among other things sovereign volatility and sociopolitical instability us regulations also govern various aspects of the international activities of domestic corporations and increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs any failure on our part or the part of our service providers to comply with applicable us regulations as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in which we or they operate could result in fines penalties injunctions or other similar restrictions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are alleged to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights owned by others or are not able to protect our intellectual property our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competitors or other third parties may allege that we or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us infringe on their intellectual property rights we also may face allegations that our employees have misappropriated intellectual property of their former employers or other third parties given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation an assertion of an infringement claim against us may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim even if we ultimately prevail pay significant money damages lose significant revenues be prohibited from using the relevant systems processes technologies or other intellectual property cease offering certain products or services or incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses moreover it has become common in recent years for individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees in addition although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs such indemnifying party may refuse or be unable to uphold its contractual obligations 

moreover we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information including copyrights trademarks patents trade secrets and controls on access and distribution these measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage and in any event we may be required to litigate to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information from misappropriation or infringement by others which is expensive could cause a diversion of resources and may not be successful third parties may challenge invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property or our intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages our competitors or other third parties may independently design around or develop similar technology or otherwise duplicate our services or products such that we could not assert our intellectual property rights against them in addition our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure 

we have launched our new brand “synchrony” and expect to spend significant amounts over the next few years promoting the new brand we recently filed trademark applications to protect our new name in the united states and certain other countries but the registrations of these trademarks are not complete and they may ultimately not become registered our use of our new name for our existing or any new products in the united states or other countries may be challenged by third parties and we may become involved in legal proceedings to protect or defend our rights with respect to our new name all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses 

our business is subject to increased risks of litigation and regulatory actions as a result of a number of factors and from various sources including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry 

in the normal course of business from time to time we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business activities certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in addition while historically the arbitration provision in our customer agreements generally has limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future there may also be legislative administrative or regulatory efforts to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of predispute arbitration clauses including by the cfpb or we may be compelled as a result of competitive pressure or reputational concerns to voluntarily eliminate predispute arbitration clauses 

we are also involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business collectively “regulatory matters” which could subject us to significant fines penalties obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses diminished earnings and damage to our reputation the current environment of additional regulation increased regulatory compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may prevent or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services there is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will not in the future affect how we conduct our business and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we contest liability andor the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter the outcome of pending and future matters could be material to our results of operations financial condition and cash flows depending on among other factors the level of our earnings for that period and could adversely affect our business and reputation for a discussion of certain legal proceedings see “ item 1   business—regulation and supervision—consumer financial services regulation ” note 18 legal proceedings and regulatory matters  to our consolidated and combined financial statements and “ item 3   legal proceedings ” 

in addition to litigation and regulatory matters from time to time through our operational and compliance controls we identify compliance issues that require us to make operational changes and depending on the nature of the issue result in financial remediation to impacted cardholders these selfidentified issues and voluntary remediation payments could be significant depending on the issue and the number of cardholders impacted they also could generate litigation or regulatory investigations that subject us to additional adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business 

recently financial services companies have been experiencing increased reputational risk as consumers take issue with certain of their practices or judgments maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining customers partners investors and employees in particular adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could also make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy of increasing retail deposits at the bank and may lead to decreases in deposits harm to our reputation can arise from many sources including employee misconduct misconduct by our partners outsourced service providers or other counterparties litigation or regulatory actions failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality inadequate protection of customer information and compliance failures negative publicity regarding us or others engaged in a similar business or activities whether or not accurate may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and motivate key officers and employees 

our success depends in large part on our ability to retain recruit and motivate key officers and employees our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for senior executives in the financial services and payment industry is intense although we do not currently anticipate any significant changes to the management team following the completion of the separation we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel following the completion of the separation when we are no longer part of ge or at any other time guidance issued by the federal banking regulators as well as proposed rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the doddfrank act may limit the type and structure of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior executives in addition proposed rules under the doddfrank act would prohibit the payment of “excessive” compensation to our executives compensation paid to officers of the bank would be subject to comparable limitations these restrictions could negatively impact our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting retaining and motivating key personnel failure to retain talented senior leadership could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in multiple jurisdictions and we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives may be proposed such as proposals for fundamental tax reform in the united states and lowering the corporate tax rate which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our deferred tax assets tax positions andor our tax liabilities in addition us federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our historical tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in defending our position in connection with any such challenge 

state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could change and adversely affect our results of operations 

state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could adversely affect our results of operations retailers collect sales tax from retail customers and remit those collections to the applicable states when customers fail to repay their loans including the amount of sales tax advanced by us to the merchant on their behalf we are entitled in some cases to seek a refund of the amount of sales tax from the applicable state sales tax laws and regulations enacted by the various states are subject to interpretation and our compliance with such laws is routinely subject to audit and review by the states audit risk is concentrated in several states and these states are conducting ongoing audits the outcomes of ongoing and any future audits and changes in the states’ interpretation of the sales tax laws and regulations involving the recovery of tax on bad debts could materially adversely impact our results of operations 

risks relating to regulation 

 

our business is subject to extensive government regulation supervision examination and enforcement which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business including our relationships with our customers is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination under us federal state and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices treatment of our customers safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure liquidity dividends and other capital distributions transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel as a unitary savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as a large provider of consumer financial services we are also subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb until the ge slhc deregistration we will be controlled by gecc which is also subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board the bank is a federally chartered savings association as such the bank is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the occ which is its primary regulator and by the cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic we gecc and the bank are regularly reviewed and examined by our respective regulators which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require response and attention see “ item 1   business—regulation and supervision ” for more information about the regulations applicable to us 

banking laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect federally insured deposits the dif and the banking system as a whole and not intended to protect our stockholders noteholders or creditors if we or the bank or until the ge slhc deregistration gecc fail to satisfy applicable laws and regulations our respective regulators have broad discretion to enforce those laws and regulations including with respect to the operation of our business required capital levels payment of dividends and other capital distributions engaging in certain activities and making acquisitions and investments our regulators also have broad discretion with respect to the enforcement of applicable laws and regulations including through enforcement actions that could subject us to civil money penalties customer remediations increased compliance costs and limits or prohibitions on our ability to offer certain products and services or to engage in certain activities in addition to the extent we undertake actions requiring regulatory approval or nonobjection our regulators may make their approval or nonobjection subject to conditions or restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition any other actions taken by our regulators could also have a material adverse impact on our business reputation and brand results of operations and financial condition moreover some of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less restrictive legislative and regulatory regimes which may have the effect of providing them with a competitive advantage over us 

new laws or regulations or policy or practical changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our own reexamination of our current practices could adversely impact our profitability limit our ability to continue existing or pursue new business activities require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with customers affect retention of our key personnel or expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs andor customer remediation these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for example the cfpb has broad authority over our businesses see “ —there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureau’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business ” 

we are also subject to potential enforcement and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties and fines customer remediations and increased compliance costs as well as damage our reputation and brand and limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices for a discussion of risks related to actions or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies see “ —risks relating to our business—litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses ” 

the doddfrank act has had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the doddfrank act was enacted on july 21 2010 while certain provisions in the act were effective immediately many of the provisions require implementing regulations to be effective the doddfrank act and regulations promulgated thereunder have had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition for example the doddfrank act and related regulations restrict certain business practices impose more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements as well as additional costs including increased compliance costs and increased costs of funding raised through the issuance of assetbacked securities on us limit the fees we can charge for services and impact the value of our assets in addition the doddfrank act requires us to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution we control such as the bank such support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interest of synchrony or its stockholders noteholders or creditors we describe certain provisions of the doddfrank act and other legislative and regulatory developments in “ item 1   business—regulation and supervision ” federal agencies continue to promulgate regulations to implement the doddfrank act and these regulations may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many provisions of the doddfrank act require the adoption of additional rules to implement in addition the doddfrank act mandates multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action as a result the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations remains unclear and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureau’s actions will impact our business the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business 

the cfpb which commenced operations in july 2011 has broad authority over our businesses this includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions such as us and the bank for compliance the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory supervisory and enforcement authority the federal reserve board and the occ and state government agencies may also invoke their supervisory and enforcement authorities to prevent unfair and deceptive acts or practices these federal and state agencies are authorized to remediate violations of consumer protection laws in a number of ways including collecting civil money penalties and fines and providing for customer restitution the cfpb also engages in consumer financial education requests data and promotes the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities in addition the cfpb maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the products we offer this system could inform future cfpb decisions with respect to its regulatory enforcement or examination focus 

there continues to be uncertainty as to how the cfpb’s strategies and priorities including in both its examination and enforcement processes will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward actions by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer them for example in july 2012 the cfpb issued an industry bulletin regarding marketing practices with respect to credit card addon products including debt cancellation products see “ item 1   business—regulation and supervision—consumer financial services regulation ” the bank has made a number of changes including changes in response to the cfpb bulletin with respect to its marketing and sale of debt cancellation products to credit card customers including ceasing all telesales of such products and the bank has also enhanced the disclosures associated with its website sales of such products in addition in october 2013 the cfpb published its first biennial report reviewing the impact of the card act on the consumer credit card market in the report the cfpb identified practices that may warrant further scrutiny by it including addon products such as debt protection identity theft protection credit score monitoring and other products that are supplementary to the extension of credit cards that charge substantial application fees and deferred interest offers and products which could include our promotional financing products the report further identified concerns regarding the adequacy of online disclosures as well as of the disclosures associated with rewards products and grace periods separately the cfpb is also studying predispute arbitration clauses and our litigation exposure could increase if the cfpb exercises its authority to limit or ban predispute arbitration clauses 

although we have committed significant resources to enhancing our compliance programs changes by the cfpb in regulatory expectations interpretations or practices or interpretations that are different or stricter than ours or those adopted in the past by other regulators could increase the risk of additional enforcement actions fines and penalties actions by the cfpb could result in requirements such as under the 2013 cfpb consent order to alter our products and services that may make them less attractive to consumers or less profitable to us see “ —changes to our methods of offering our carecredit products could materially impact operating results ” in addition on june 19 2014 we entered into the 2014 cfpb consent order with respect to our debt cancellation product and sales practices and an unrelated issue that arose from the bank’s selfidentified omission of certain spanishspeaking customers and customers residing in puerto rico from two offers that were made to certain delinquent customers on june 19 2014 we also entered into the 2014 doj consent order to resolve the dojs coordinated investigation into issues related to such offers see “ item 1 business—regulation and supervision—consumer financial services regulation ” 

future actions by the cfpb or other regulators against us or our competitors that discourage the use of products we offer or suggest to consumers the desirability of other products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of customers if the cfpb changes regulations which were adopted in the past by other regulators and transferred to the cfpb by the doddfrank act or modifies through supervision or enforcement past related regulatory guidance or interprets existing regulations in a different or stricter manner than they have been interpreted in the past by us the industry or other regulators our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if future regulatory or legislative restrictions or prohibitions are imposed that affect our ability to offer promotional financing for certain of our products or require us to make significant changes to our business practices and we are unable to develop compliant alternatives with acceptable returns these restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the doddfrank act authorizes state officials to enforce regulations issued by the cfpb and to enforce the act’s general prohibition against unfair deceptive or abusive practices this could make it more difficult than in the past for federal financial regulators to declare state laws that differ from federal standards to be preempted to the extent that states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or state officials and courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer laws that differ from those adopted by the cfpb we may be required to alter or cease offering products or services in some jurisdictions which would increase compliance costs and reduce our ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide and we may be subject to a higher risk of state enforcement actions 

changes to our methods of offering our carecredit products could materially impact operating results 

the 2013 cfpb consent order relating to our carecredit platform requires us to pay up to 341 million to qualifying customers and among other things to provide additional training and monitoring of our carecredit partners to include provisions in agreements with our carecredit partners prohibiting charges for certain services not yet rendered to make changes to certain consumer disclosures application procedures and procedures for resolution of customer complaints and to terminate carecredit partners that have chargeback rates in excess of certain thresholds some of the changes required by the 2013 cfpb consent order are similar to requirements in the assurance we believe the bank is in substantial compliance with the material business practice changes required by the 2013 cfpb consent order and the assurance subject to ongoing reporting obligations and will complete the additional provider training by the fourth quarter of 2015 in addition to the costs of remediation which were not material for the assurance and will be up to 341 million for the 2013 cfpb consent order we incurred onetime costs of approximately 3 million to implement these changes and estimate ongoing annual costs of approximately 3 million we have only recently implemented certain of the process changes required by the 2013 cfpb consent order and the assurance and will continue to actively monitor and assess their impact on our carecredit program although at this time we do not believe that the 2013 cfpb consent order and the assurance will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations going forward we cannot be sure this will be the case particularly as providers become acclimated to the required changes and we cannot be sure whether the settlement will have an adverse impact on our reputation or whether the new requirements imposed by the 2013 cfpb consent order or the assurance will adversely affect providers’ or customers’ use of our programs or our business moreover we may elect or be required to make changes with respect to these and other deferred interest products in the future and those changes may adversely affect customers’ use of our credit cards or our business in addition our resolutions with the cfpb and the new york attorney general do not preclude other regulators or state attorneys general from seeking additional monetary or injunctive relief with respect to carecredit and any such relief could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

failure by synchrony the bank and until the ge slhc deregistration gecc to meet applicable capital adequacy rules could have a material adverse effect on us 

synchrony and the bank must meet rules for capital adequacy as discussed in “ item 1 business—regulation and supervision ” as a savings and loan holding company synchrony historically has not been required to maintain minimum capital beginning as soon as during 2015 however we expect that synchrony will be subject to capital requirements similar to those that apply to the bank in addition as discussed below until the ge slhc deregistration we will be controlled by gecc which itself is expected as soon as during 2015 to be subject to capital requirements similar to those that apply to the bank see “ —as long as we are controlled by gecc for bank regulatory purposes regulation and supervision of gecc could adversely affect us ” the capital requirements applicable to the bank have recently been substantially revised including as a result of basel iii and the requirements of the doddfrank act although we cannot predict the effects of these newly adopted rules implementing basel iii and the doddfrank act synchrony the bank and gecc expect to be subject to increasingly stringent capital adequacy standards in the future 

in connection with applicable capital adequacy standards synchrony the bank and gecc also will be required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the federal reserve board’s and the occ’s stress test regulations synchrony the bank and gecc will each be required to use stresstesting methodologies providing for results under at least three different sets of conditions including baseline adverse and severely adverse conditions in addition as part of meeting our minimum capital requirements we and gecc may be required to comply with the federal reserve board’s ccar process or some modified version of the ccar process which would measure our minimum capital requirement levels under various stress scenarios in connection with this process we and gecc may be required to develop for the federal reserve board’s review and approval a capital plan that will include how we and gecc will each meet our minimum capital requirements under specified stress scenarios 

if synchrony the bank or until the ge slhc deregistration gecc fails to meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements its operations results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected among other things failure by synchrony the bank or until the ge slhc deregistration gecc to maintain its status as “well capitalized” or otherwise meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements could compromise our competitive position and result in restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board or the occ including potentially on the bank’s ability to engage in certain activities these could include restrictions on the bank’s ability to enter into transactions with affiliates accept brokered deposits grow its assets engage in material transactions extend credit in certain highly leveraged transactions amend or change its charter bylaws or accounting methods pay interest on its liabilities without regard to regulatory caps on the rates that may be paid on deposits and pay dividends or repurchase stock in addition failure to maintain the well capitalized status of the bank could result in our having to invest additional capital in the bank which could in turn require us to raise additional capital the market and demand for and cost of our assetbacked securities also could be adversely affected by failure to meet current or future capital requirements 

we may pay dividends or repurchase our common stock which may reduce the amount of funds available to satisfy our indebtedness the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends or make payments on our indebtedness 

in connection with our application to the federal reserve board described above and the separation we expect to continue to increase our capital and liquidity levels by among other things retaining net earnings and by not paying a dividend or returning capital through stock repurchases until our application to the federal reserve board is approved thereafter our board of directors intends to consider our policy regarding the payment and amount of dividends and may consider stock repurchases in each case consistent with maintaining capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements the declaration and amount of any future dividends to holders of our common stock or stock repurchases will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including the financial condition earnings capital and liquidity requirements of us and the bank applicable regulatory restrictions including any restrictions that may be imposed in connection with the separation corporate law and contractual restrictions including restrictions contained in the bank term loan and the gecc term loan and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant however any future payment of dividends or repurchases of our capital stock will reduce the amount of funds available to satisfy our indebtedness 

we rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity including to pay our obligations under our indebtedness and other indebtedness as they become due and federal law limits the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us for example occ regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital including payment of dividends stock redemptions and repurchases cashout mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account the bank must obtain the occ’s approval prior to making a capital distribution in certain circumstances including if the bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements or will not do so as a result of the proposed capital distribution or certain net income requirements in addition the bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared dividend or other distribution with the federal reserve board the federal reserve board or the occ may object to a capital distribution if among other things the bank is or as a result of such dividend or distribution would be undercapitalized or the federal reserve board or occ has safety and soundness concerns additional restrictions on bank dividends may apply if the bank fails the qtl test the application of these restrictions on the bank’s ability to pay dividends involves broad discretion on the part of our regulators the bank must also meet certain conditions to declare or pay a dividend under the bank’s operating agreement with the occ entered into in connection with its acquisition of the deposit business of metlife limitations on the bank’s payments of dividends and other distributions and payments that we receive from the bank could reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to pay dividends or our obligations under our indebtedness see “ item 1   business—regulation  supervision—savings association regulation—dividends and stock repurchases ” and “ —activities ” 

regulations relating to privacy information security and data protection could increase our costs affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities 

we are subject to various privacy information security and data protection laws including requirements concerning security breach notification and we could be negatively impacted by them for example in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the glba and implementing regulations and guidance among other things the glba i imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties ii requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties with certain exceptions and iii requires financial institutions to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches 

moreover various united states federal banking regulatory agencies states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual consumer regulatory andor law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach many of these requirements also apply broadly to our partners that accept our cards in many countries that have yet to impose data security breach notification requirements regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data security breaches 

furthermore legislators andor regulators in the united states and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy data protection and information securityrelated practices our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer andor employee information and some of our current or planned business activities this could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives in the united states this includes increased privacyrelated enforcement activity at the federal level by the federal trade commission as well as at the state level such as with regard to mobile applications 

compliance with current or future privacy data protection and information security laws including those regarding security breach notification affecting customer andor employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services such as products or services that involve us sharing information with third parties or storing sensitive credit card information which could materially and adversely affect our profitability our failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory investigations and government actions litigation fines or sanctions consumer or partner actions and damage to our reputation and our brand all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our use of thirdparty vendors and our other ongoing thirdparty business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention 

we regularly use thirdparty vendors and subcontractors as part of our business we also have substantial ongoing business relationships with our partners and other thirdparties these types of thirdparty relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic and our consumer regulator the cfpb regulatory guidance requires us to enhance our due diligence ongoing monitoring and control over our thirdparty vendors and subcontractors and other ongoing thirdparty business relationships including with our partners in certain cases we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors andor their subcontractors to meet these enhanced requirements which could increase our costs we expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our thirdparty relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships as a result if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our thirdparty vendors and subcontractors or other ongoing thirdparty business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately we could be subject to enforcement actions including the imposition of civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation 

failure to comply with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us 

we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act and the patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale these controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments we cannot be sure our programs and controls will be effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as long as we are controlled by gecc for bank regulatory purposes regulation and supervision of gecc could adversely affect us 

gecc is a regulated savings and loan holding company and therefore is subject to all of the regulation and supervision to which we are subject until the ge slhc deregistration regulation and supervision of gecc as a savings and loan holding company may for reasons related or unrelated to us materially and adversely affect us including restricting our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock initiate or continue various business activities or practices grow our assets or complete the separation 

as a nonbank sifi gecc our indirect parent company is subject to enhanced prudential standards and regulation by the federal reserve board nonbank sifis such as gecc currently are subject to some but not all of the enhanced prudential standards under the doddfrank act such as resolution planning the federal reserve board has also proposed to apply other enhanced prudential standards to gecc by order if adopted as proposed these standards are expected to include among other things enhanced board and risk governance enhanced capital and liquidity levels compliance with capital planning and stress testing requirements and restrictions on intercompany transactions although the enhanced prudential standards currently applicable to gecc in its capacity as a nonbank sifi do not have the effect of imposing direct regulatory obligations or restrictions on us we cannot be certain that standards imposed in the future by the federal reserve board on gecc as a nonbank sifi will not have the effect of directly or indirectly imposing obligations or restrictions on us so long as we are controlled by gecc for bank regulatory purposes and those obligations and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example capital adequacy capital plan and stresstesting requirements to which gecc may be made subject as a nonbank sifi could affect among other things our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock our ability to redeem our indebtedness or gecc’s ability to complete the separation 

risks relating to our separation from ge 

 

ge may not complete the separation as planned or at all 

on november 15 2013 ge announced that it planned a staged exit from our business consistent with its strategy of reducing gecc’s percentage of ge’s total earnings and increasing gecc’s focus on its commercial lending and leasing businesses the ipo was the first step in that exit as a result of the ipo ge currently beneficially owns 846 of our outstanding common stock 

ge has indicated that it currently is targeting to complete its exit from our business in late 2015 through the separation the separation would be subject to various conditions including receipt of any necessary bank regulatory and other approvals the existence of satisfactory market conditions and in the case of a taxfree transaction a private letter ruling from the irs as to certain issues relating to and an opinion of counsel confirming the taxfree treatment of the transaction to ge and its stockholders in addition since ge’s exit from our business will not be completed until ge has obtained the ge slhc deregistration ge’s willingness to proceed with the separation may be conditioned on its obtaining the necessary determination by the federal reserve board that the ge slhc deregistration is effective ie that following the separation ge along with gecc and gecfi no longer controls us and therefore ge gecc and gecfi are released from savings and loan holding company registration 

the conditions related to the separation and the ge slhc deregistration may not be satisfied in late 2015 or thereafter or ge may decide for any other reason not to consummate the separation in late 2015 or thereafter also satisfying the conditions related to the separation and the ge slhc deregulation may require actions that ge has not anticipated any delay by ge in completing or uncertainty about its ability or intent to complete the separation and the ge slhc deregistration on the planned timetable and the contemplated terms including at the contemplated capital and liquidity levels or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if ge is unable to obtain the ge slhc deregistration it will continue to have significant control over us 

if the ge slhc deregistration is not obtained and until it is obtained ge will continue to have significant control over us ge’s degree of control will depend on among other things its level of ownership of our common stock the number of persons it is entitled to designate for nomination for election to our board of directors under the master agreement that we entered into with gecc and for limited purposes only ge prior to the completion of the ipo the “master agreement” and the requirement under the master agreement that we obtain gecc’s prior written approval before undertaking or permitting or authorizing the bank or any of our other subsidiaries to undertake various significant corporate actions this may mean that ge through gecc may not always exercise control of us in a way that benefits our public stockholders or noteholders conflicts of interest may arise between us and ge and gecc that could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us we will also continue to be subject to the regulation and supervision applicable to ge gecc and companies under their control and such regulation and supervision may for reasons related or unrelated to us adversely affect us until the ge slhc deregistration is obtained all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us see “ —ge has significant control over us and may not always exercise its control in a way that benefits our public stockholders or noteholders” and  “—risks relating to regulation—as long as we are controlled by gecc for bank regulatory purposes regulation and supervision of gecc could adversely affect us ” 

we need federal reserve board approval to continue to be a savings and loan holding company following the ge slhc deregistration we may not receive this approval in a timely manner or at all and additional approval conditions beyond what we are anticipating may be imposed that prevent or delay the separation or the ge slhc deregistration or require us to incur significant additional expense 

the savings and loan holding company act generally requires federal reserve board approval before a company acquires a savings association and becomes a savings and loan holding company we were exempt from this requirement when we initially acquired the bank and became a savings and loan holding company because we were a subsidiary of ge gecc and gecfi existing savings and loan holding companies we do not expect this exemption to continue to apply to us following the ge slhc deregistration as a result we will be required to file an application with and receive approval from the federal reserve board to continue to be a savings and loan holding company and to retain ownership of the bank following the ge slhc deregistration see “ item 1 business—regulation and supervision—savings and loan holding company regulation ” 

we expect that the federal reserve board will not act on our application to continue to be a savings and loan holding company and to retain ownership of the bank following the ge slhc deregistration until among other things the federal reserve board has completed an indepth review of our preparedness to operate on a standalone basis independently of ge and is satisfied with the results we cannot predict when this review will begin but expect it will not begin until after we file our application in connection with the federal reserve board’s review and prior to our filing an application with the federal reserve board to continue to be a savings and loan holding company and to retain ownership of the bank following the ge slhc deregistration we will continue to establish and expand our operations and infrastructure and take other steps to allow us to operate as a fully standalone public company independently of ge see “ item 1 business—ge ownership and our separation from ge ” 

once the federal reserve board begins its review of our preparedness to operate on a standalone basis we cannot predict how long such review will take we expect however that the review will require a considerable period of time in addition to obtain approval of our application to continue to be a savings and loan holding company and retain ownership of the bank following the ge slhc deregistration we may have to take additional actions beyond the significant operations and infrastructure expansion and other steps we are already planning for example we may have to increase our capital and liquidity levels beyond what we are anticipating restrict our payment of dividends or not make any payment of dividends for a longer period than what we anticipate make further changes to among other things our corporate governance risk management capital planning treasury information technology compliance regulatory internal audit and other control operations and infrastructure stop receiving any transitional services from ge repay all related party debt owed to gecc or further diversify our funding sources such as by reducing the amount of our brokered deposits or increasing the amount of our unsecured debt beyond what we are anticipating those actions may involve significant additional expenses for us and require significant time to implement beyond what we now anticipate 

even after taking any such actions there is no assurance that our application to continue to be a savings and loan holding company following the ge slhc deregistration will be approved the federal reserve board will consider a range of factors and has significant discretion in reviewing our application and its action on our application may be affected by circumstances we do not know or cannot predict at this time including factors identified in the federal reserve board’s indepth review of us changes in our current condition or changes in general economic and market conditions relevant to our operations the federal reserve board will also seek the views of the occ and fdic as regulators of the bank and their views may have a significant effect on the federal reserve board’s action on the application if the application is not approved ge will not be able to obtain the ge slhc deregistration as currently planned ge may be unwilling to proceed with the separation unless or until it is able to obtain the ge slhc deregistration 

even if our application is approved we cannot be certain when such approval will be granted or what conditions or restrictions if any will be imposed for such approval the federal reserve board’s approval could include conditions or restrictions that are more onerous than those generally applicable to savings and loan holding companies and that require additional actions or impose additional limitations beyond those we may already have taken or assumed in order to obtain approval and achieve the separation as described above any such conditions or restrictions including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock after the separation or additional required actions could be significant involve significant additional expense for us and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition ge’s ability or willingness to proceed with the separation as currently planned could be affected by the nature and effect of any such conditions restrictions or additional required actions 

prior to the separation and the ge slhc deregistration we need to establish and significantly expand many aspects of our operations and infrastructure and our failure to do so in a timely manner within anticipated costs and without disrupting our ongoing business could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could delay or prevent the separation and the ge slhc deregistration 

although historically we have operated as a largely standalone business within gecc with our own sales marketing risk management operations collections customer service and compliance functions we continue to establish and significantly expand many aspects of our operations and infrastructure prior to the separation to enable us to operate as a standalone public company after our transitional services with ge terminate for most services within 24 months after august 5 2014 the ipo completion date and to enable ge to obtain the ge slhc deregistration in connection with the separation or thereafter the operations and infrastructure to be established or expanded relate to among other areas corporate governance risk management capital planning treasury information technology compliance regulatory internal audit and other control operations and infrastructure 

establishing and expanding our operations and infrastructure involves substantial costs the hiring and integration of a large number of new employees including a number at senior levels and integration of the new and expanded operations and infrastructure with our existing operations and infrastructure and in some cases the operations and infrastructure of our partners and other third parties it also requires significant time and attention from our senior management and others throughout the company in addition to the time and attention required by their daytoday responsibilities running the business moreover we do not expect that the federal reserve board will act on our application to continue to be a savings and loan holding company and to retain ownership of the bank following the ge slhc deregistration until among other things it has completed an indepth review of our preparedness to operate on a standalone basis which we expect to involve a review of our operations and infrastructure as a result delays in establishing and expanding our operations and infrastructure may delay the review of our preparedness by the federal reserve board which could delay the separation and the ge slhc deregistration moreover the federal reserve board may require substantial additions or changes to our operations and infrastructure including the operations and infrastructure we anticipate adding all of which could significantly increase our costs and further delay the separation and the ge slhc deregistration see “ —ge may not complete the separation as planned or at all ” 

even if the ge slhc deregistration is obtained we also will need federal reserve board agreement that we meet the criteria for a savings and loan holding company to be treated as a financial holding company and we cannot be certain the federal reserve board will provide such agreement or what additional conditions or restrictions it may impose if it does so 

we currently are a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company but do not expect to continue to qualify as such a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company following the ge slhc deregistration as a result in connection with our application to continue to be a savings and loan holding company we will need to submit to the federal reserve board a request to become a financial holding company in order to engage in activities that are permissible only for savings and loan holding companies that are treated as financial holding companies including to continue to obtain financing through our securitization programs 

we believe that we will meet the criteria for a savings and loan holding company to be treated as a financial holding company however we cannot assure you that the federal reserve board will agree or that the federal reserve board will not in order for us to be treated as a financial holding company impose additional conditions or restrictions which may be similar to or different from those otherwise imposed in connection with the separation ge’s ability or willingness to proceed with the separation as currently planned could be affected by the nature of any such conditions or restrictions required by the federal reserve board in order for us to be treated as a financial holding company 

the separation could adversely affect our business and profitability as we would no longer be able to benefit from ge’s strong brand and reputation 

as a subsidiary of ge we historically have marketed many of our products using the “ge” brand name and logo and we believe the association with ge has provided many benefits including 

 the separation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain partners we may be required to provide more favorable pricing and other terms to our partners and take other action to maintain our relationship with existing and attract new partners all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

although we do not expect a material loss of customers or usage following the separation or more difficulty attracting new customers and increasing their usage because our product will continue to be closely associated with our partners and their brands we cannot be sure this will be the case in addition although our capital at the bank was increased in connection with the ipo and the customerfacing aspects of our business will remain largely unchanged following the separation we cannot be sure that we will not lose deposits or have more difficulty attracting new deposits following the separation because of depositor concerns that we will no longer be part of ge and benefiting from its brand and financial strength 

we cannot predict the effect that the separation will have on our partners customers depositors or employees the risks relating to the separation could materialize at various times including 

 

we will have the right to use the ge brand name and logo for only a limited period of time and if we fail to establish a new independently recognized brand name we could be adversely affected 

in march 2014 we changed our corporate name to “synchrony financial” and in june 2014 the bank changed its corporate name to “synchrony bank” although we the bank and our other subsidiaries may continue to use the ge brand name and logo in marketing our products and services for a limited period of time pursuant to a transitional trademark license agreement ge granted us the right to use certain “ge” “ge capital” “ge capital retail bank” “ge money” and “gecaf” marks and related gecaf logos and the ge monogram in connection with our products and services until such time as ge ceases to beneficially own more than 50 of our outstanding common stock subject to certain exceptions eg we generally will have a right to use those marks and related logos and the monogram on our credit cards for a period of three and a half years after the completion of the ipo development of a new brand is an expensive uncertain and longterm process when our right to use the ge brand name and logo expires we may not be able to maintain or enjoy comparable name recognition or status under our new brand if we are unable to successfully manage the transition of our business to our new brand in a timely manner our reputation among and relationship with our partners customers depositors and employees could be adversely affected 

the terms of our arrangements with ge may be more favorable than what we will be able to obtain from an unaffiliated third party we may be unable to replace the services gecc provides us in a timely manner or on comparable terms 

we and gecc have entered into a transitional services agreement and other agreements pursuant to the transitional services agreement gecc and its affiliates agreed to provide us with transitional services after the ipo including treasury payroll tax and other financial services human resources and employee benefits services information systems and network access application and support related services and procurement and sourcing support 

we negotiated these arrangements with gecc in the context of a parentsubsidiary relationship although gecc is contractually obligated to provide us with services during the term of the transitional services agreement we cannot assure you that these services will be sustained at the same level after the expiration of that agreement or that we will be able to replace these services in a timely manner or on comparable terms when gecc ceases to provide services pursuant to those arrangements our costs of procuring those services from third parties may increase other agreements with ge and gecc also govern the relationship between us and ge after the ipo and provide for the allocation of employee benefits tax and other liabilities and obligations attributable or related to periods or events prior to the ipo they also contain terms and provisions that may be more favorable than terms and provisions we might have obtained in arm’s length negotiations with unaffiliated third parties 

ge has significant control over us and may not always exercise its control in a way that benefits our public stockholders or noteholders 

ge currently beneficially owns 846 of our outstanding common stock and has indicated that it intends to divest its remaining interest in us however so long as ge continues to beneficially own more than 50 of our outstanding voting stock ge generally will be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval ge will have the voting power to elect the board of directors and ge will have significant influence over and in some cases the right to approve certain compensation paid to our executive officers 

the master agreement gives gecc certain significant rights until such time if any as the ge slhc deregistration occurs some of gecc’s rights under the master agreement will not terminate until the ge slhc deregistration occurs and therefore it is possible that ge will exercise some or all of such rights at a time when it does not own any of our common stock under the master agreement gecc has the right to designate five persons for nomination for election to our ninemember board of directors so long as ge beneficially owns more than 50 of our outstanding common stock and to designate a lesser number as ge’s percentage ownership decreases until the ge slhc deregistration in addition subject to certain exceptions and ownership thresholds until the ge slhc deregistration we will be required to obtain gecc’s prior written approval before undertaking or permitting or authorizing the bank or any of our other subsidiaries to undertake various significant corporate actions these include subject to certain agreed exceptions 

 

 ge’s interests may differ from your interests and the interests of our stockholders and therefore actions ge takes with respect to us as a controlling or significant stockholder or under the master agreement may not be favorable to you or our stockholders 

as long as ge owns a majority of our common stock we will rely on certain of the exemptions from the corporate governance requirements of the nyse available for “controlled companies” 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance listing standards of the new york stock exchange “nyse” because ge continues to own more than 50 of our outstanding common stock a “controlled company” may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the nyse consistent with this the master agreement provides that so long as we are a “controlled company” we will elect not to comply with the requirements to have a majority of independent directors or to have the nominating and corporate governance and management development and compensation committees of our board of directors consist entirely of independent directors six of our nine directors including one member of the board of directors’ nominating and corporate governance committee and one member of the board of directors’ management development and compensation committee do not qualify as “independent directors” under the applicable listing standards of the nyse as a result you will not benefit from certain of the protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nyse 

our historical combined financial information does not reflect the results we would have achieved as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical combined financial information included in this report does not reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods presented and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

in addition the historical combined financial information does not reflect the impact of any conditions or restrictions that may be imposed by the federal reserve board in connection with the ge slhc deregistration and the separation including requiring higher capital or liquidity levels or restricting our business activities or growth accordingly our historical combined financial information should not be relied upon as representative or indicative of what our financial condition or results of operations would have been had the ipo and related transactions occurred on the dates indicated this information also should not be relied upon as representative or indicative of our future financial condition results of operations or cash flows for additional information relating to our historical combined financial information see “ item 6 financial information ” 

the obligations associated with being a public company will require significant resources and management attention 

as a result of the ipo we became subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” and sec rules under that act the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sarbanesoxley act and sec rules thereunder require among other things that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting we have established all of the procedures and practices required as a subsidiary of ge but we will have additional procedures and practices to establish as a separate standalone public company as a result we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur furthermore the need to establish the corporate infrastructure necessary for a standalone public company may divert some of management’s attention from operating our business and implementing our strategy we have made and will continue to make changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations however the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company in addition we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in order to comply with these requirements 

the sarbanesoxley act and sec rules require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting starting with the second annual report that we file with the sec and in the annual report for the next succeeding year a report by our independent auditors addressing such assessments failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading prices of our securities 

ge could engage in business and other activities that compete with us 

ge has agreed that subject to certain exceptions for two years after the ge slhc deregistration it will not engage in the business of providing credit to consumers through i private label credit cards or dual cards in conjunction with programs with retailers merchants or healthcare providers primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the applicable retailer merchant or healthcare provider or ii general purpose credit cards in each case in the united states and canada our certificate of incorporation provides that other than that noncompete agreement and any other contractual provisions to the contrary ge will have no obligation to refrain from 

 ge has significant financial services businesses including owning a bank that takes deposits in addition to the bank providing consumer financing outside the united states and canada including private label credit cards and providing commercial financing including inventory floorplan and other financing to small and mediumsized businesses ge continues to engage in these businesses to the extent that ge engages in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or engages in business with any of our partners customers or vendors our ability to successfully operate and expand our business may be hampered 

conflicts of interest may arise between us and ge that could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us 

questions relating to conflicts of interest may arise between us and ge in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships five of our directors are current or former officers of ge andor gecc these directors and many of our senior executive officers also own ge stock and options to purchase ge stock and all of them participate in ge pension plans ownership interests of our directors or officers in ge stock or service as both a director of our company and a director officer andor employee of ge andor gecc could give rise to potential conflicts of interest when a director or officer is faced with a decision that could have different implications for us as compared to ge andor gecc these potential conflicts could arise for example over matters such as the desirability of changes in our business and operations funding and capital matters regulatory matters matters arising with respect to the master agreement and other agreements with ge employee retention or recruiting or our dividend policy 

the corporate opportunity policy set forth in our certificate of incorporation addresses certain potential conflicts of interest between our company on the one hand and ge and its officers who are directors of our company on the other hand although these provisions are designed to resolve certain conflicts between us and ge fairly we cannot assure you that any conflicts will be so resolved 

if ge distributes our stock to its stockholders in exchange for its common stock in a transaction that is intended to be taxfree to ge we could have a material indemnification obligation to ge under the tssa if we cause the distribution or certain related preliminary internal transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment or in the case of certain significant transfers of our stock following such distribution 

ge has indicated that it currently intends to complete its exit from its investment in us by making a distribution of all of its remaining shares of our stock to its stockholders in exchange for ge’s common stock in a transaction that would be designed to qualify for taxfree treatment to ge and its stockholders under section 355 of the internal revenue code the “code” completion by ge of any such distribution is conditioned on among other things a private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain issues relating to and an opinion from tax counsel confirming the taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code of the distribution and the taxfree treatment of a series of preliminary transactions that would be required prior to implementing the distribution the irs ruling and the opinion of tax counsel will rely on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from ge and us regarding the past and future conduct of ge’s and our businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied ge may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinion of tax counsel accordingly notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinion of tax counsel the irs could determine that the distribution or any of the preliminary transactions is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of ge or us after the distribution if the distribution or any of the preliminary transactions is determined to be taxable ge could incur significant tax liabilities and under the tax sharing and separation agreement the “tssa” we entered into with ge at the completion of the ipo we may be required to indemnify ge for any such liabilities if the liability is caused by any action or inaction undertaken by us following the completion of the ipo or as a result of any direct or indirect transfers of our stock following the distribution 

in order to preserve the taxfree status of the distribution and the preliminary transactions to ge the tssa includes a provision generally prohibiting us from taking action after the completion of the ipo that would cause the distribution or the preliminary transactions to become taxable as a result and given our indemnity obligation to ge under the tssa for tax liabilities incurred by ge as a result of a breach of these provisions by us or as a result of any direct or indirect transfers of our stock following the distribution we may be required to forgo certain significant transactions that would otherwise have been advantageous to us for a period of time following the distribution such as certain dispositions of our assets or issuances of our stock

dividends 

dividend policy in connection with our application to the federal reserve board described above and the separation we expect to continue to increase our capital and liquidity levels by among other things retaining net earnings and not paying a dividend or returning capital through stock repurchases until our application to the federal reserve board is approved thereafter our board of directors intends to consider a policy for paying dividends and may consider stock repurchases in each case consistent with maintaining capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements the declaration and amount of any future dividends to holders of our common stock or stock repurchases will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including the financial condition earnings capital and liquidity requirements of us and the bank applicable regulatory restrictions including any restrictions that may be imposed in connection with the separation corporate law and contractual restrictions including restrictions contained in the bank term loan and the gecc term loan and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

as a savings and loan holding company our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or to repurchase our stock is subject to regulation by the federal reserve board in addition as a holding company we rely significantly on dividends distributions and other payments from the bank to fund dividends to our stockholders the ability of the bank to make dividends and other distributions and payments to us is subject to regulation by the occ and the federal reserve board see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—failure by synchrony the bank and until the ge slhc deregistration gecc to meet applicable capital adequacy rules could have a material adverse effect on us ” and “ —we may pay dividends or repurchase our common stock which may reduce the amount of funds available to satisfy our indebtedness the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to make payments on our indebtedness ” and “ regulation—savings association regulation—dividends and stock repurchases ”

introduction and business overview 

 

we   are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the united states we provide a range of credit products through programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers local merchants manufacturers buying groups industry associations and healthcare service providers which we refer to as our “partners” during 2014  we financed 1031  billion of purchase volume and at december 31 2014  we had 613  billion of loan receivables and 643 million active accounts for the year ended december 31 2014  we had net earnings of 21  billion representing a return on assets of 32  

we offer our credit products primarily through our whollyowned subsidiary synchrony bank through the bank we offer a range of deposit products insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” we are continuing to expand our direct banking operations to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities we had 350  billion in deposits at december 31 2014  

our initial public offering 

on august 5 2014 we closed the initial public offering the “ipo” of 125 million  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of 2300  per share and on september 3 2014 we issued an additional 35 million  shares of our common stock pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters in the ipo the “underwriters option” we received net proceeds from the ipo and the underwriters option of approximately 28 billion  following the closing of the ipo and the underwriters option ge owned and currently owns approximately 846  of our common stock 

debt financings 

in connection with the ipo we repaid all of our existing related party debt owed to gecc outstanding on the closing date of the ipo which totaled 80 billion we also entered into new term loan facilities with both thirdparty lenders the “bank term loan” and gecc the “gecc term loan” the borrowings under these facilities at december 31 2014 were 82 billion  and 655 million  respectively subsequent to december 31 2014 we made additional prepayments in the aggregate to these facilities of 25 billion and 206 million respectively the borrowings under the bank term loan and gecc term loan following these additional prepayments were 57 billion and 449 million respectively 

in august 2014 we also issued a total of 36 billion  principal amount of unsecured senior notes with various maturities ranging from 2017 through 2024 in addition in february 2015 we issued a total of 10 billion principal amount of unsecured senior notes maturing in 2020 see funding   liquidity and capital resources  funding sources  thirdparty debt for additional information on these facilities and unsecured senior notes 

agreements with ge and affiliates 

in connection with the ipo we entered into a master agreement and a number of other agreements with ge and gecc setting forth various matters governing our relationship with ge and gecc following the completion of the ipo see note 16 related party transactions  to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on these agreements with ge and gecc 

our sales platforms 

 

we conduct our operations through a single business segment profitability and expenses including funding costs loan losses and operating expenses are managed for the business as a whole substantially all of our operations are within the united states we offer our products through three sales platforms retail card payment solutions and carecredit those platforms are organized by the types of products we offer and the partners we work with and are measured on platform revenues loan receivables new accounts and other sales metrics see “ item 1 business  our sales platforms ” 

 

 retail card 

retail card is a leading provider of private label credit cards and also provides dual cards and small and mediumsized business credit products our patented dual cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used elsewhere we offer one or more of these products primarily through 19  national and regional retailers with which we have ongoing program agreements the average length of our relationship with these retail card partners is 16  years retail card’s platform revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables plus other income less retailer share arrangements other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned on dual card transactions when the card is used outside of our partners sales channels and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products less loyalty program payments substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard terms 

payment solutions 

payment solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans at december 31 2014  payment solutions offered these products through approximately 63000  participating partners consisting of national and regional retailers local merchants manufacturers buying groups and industry associations substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing payment solutions’ platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables including “merchant discounts” which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of foregone interest revenue associated with promotional financing 

carecredit 

carecredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures or services such as dental veterinary cosmetic vision and audiology at december 31 2014  we had a network of carecredit providers that collectively have approximately 186000  locations the vast majority of which are individual or small groups of independent healthcare providers through which we offer a carecredit branded private label credit card substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing carecredit’s platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables including merchant discounts 

our credit products 

 

through our platforms we offer three principal types of credit products credit cards commercial credit products and consumer installment loans see “ item 1 business  our credit products ” 

the following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer at december 31 2014  



credit cards 

we offer two principal types of credit cards private label credit cards and dual cards 

 commercial credit products 

we offer private label cards and cobranded cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings we also offer a commercial payinfull accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers and are rolling out an improved customer experience for this product with enhanced functionality we offer commercial credit products primarily through our retail card platform to the commercial customers of our retail card partners 

installment loans 

in payment solutions we originate installment loans to consumers and a limited number of commercial customers in the united states primarily in the power product market motorcycles atvs and lawn and garden installment loans are closedend credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments installment loans are assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates 

business trends and conditions 

 

we believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions including the following 

 

 

 

 a total of 30  of our 40 largest program agreements now have an expiration date in 2017 or beyond these 30  program agreements represented in the aggregate 672 of our total platform revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 733 of our total loan receivables including loan receivables held for sale at december 31 2014 in addition we do not expect our program agreement with one of our 40 largest programs to extend beyond its current expiration date of october 2016 this program agreement represented 32 of our total platform revenue and 16 of our retailer share arrangements in each case for the year ended december 31 2014 and 25 of our total loan receivables including loan receivables held for sale at december 31 2014 

 in addition under the terms of certain program agreements we have recently extended we have agreed to dedicate increased marketing expense and other investments to promote these programs we expect to benefit from these increased payments and other expense as they will create additional incentives for our partners to support their programs and in the case of increased marketing expense and other investments directly promote these programs all of which we expect will have a positive impact on purchase volume and result in higher loan receivables and increased interest and fees on loans we also expect to benefit from the extended duration of our amended program agreements 

 during 2012 and 2013 we enhanced our methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses and as a result we recognized incremental provisions of 343 million and 642 million in 2012 and 2013 respectively we continue to review and evaluate our methodology and models and we will implement further enhancements or changes to them as needed 

 apart from the increase related to separation we expect our expenses to continue to grow largely in line with business growth 

 

seasonality 

 

in our retail card and payment solutions platforms we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down 

the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations delinquency metrics and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods these fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year 

in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in chargeoffs as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end consistent with this historical experience we generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period as compared to the end of a calendar year in addition despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end reflecting these same seasonal trends

summary earnings 

the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods indicated 



other financial and statistical data 

the following table sets forth certain other financial and statistical data for the periods indicated 

 

 

average balance sheet 

the following tables set forth information for the periods indicated regarding average balance sheet data which are used in the discussion of interest income interest expense and net interest income that follow 

 

 the following table sets forth the amount of changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in average volume and average yieldrate variances due to changes in both average volume and average yieldrate have been allocated between the average volume and average yieldrate variances on a consistent basis based upon the respective percentage changes in average volume and average yieldrate 





interest income 

interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans which includes merchant discounts provided by partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities we include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over a oneyear period and recorded in interest and fees on loans for noncredit card receivables direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans 

we analyze interest income as a function of two principal components average interestearning assets and yield on average interestearning assets key drivers of average interestearning assets include 

 key drivers of yield on average interestearning assets include 

 interest income increased by 929 million  or 82  for the year ended   december 31 2014  this increase was driven primarily by growth in our loan receivables 

 

interest income increased by 1004 million or 97 for the year ended december 31 2013 this increase was driven primarily by the increase in average interestearning assets which contributed 1135 million to interest income for the year ended december 31 2013 partially offset by the decrease in the yield on interestearning assets from 2122 to 2010 which reduced interest income by 131 million while yield on interestearning loan receivables was relatively flat the significant increase in the amount of cash and equivalents in our liquidity portfolio negatively impacted overall yield on interestearning assets 

 interest expense 

interest expense is incurred on our interestbearing liabilities which consisted of interestbearing deposit accounts borrowings of consolidated securitization entities related party debt provided by gecc the bank term loan and senior unsecured notes 

key drivers of interest expense include 

 interest expense increased by 180 million  or 243  for the year ended   december 31 2014  driven primarily by increases in average interestbearing liabilities of 7104 million  or 149  the increase in average interestbearing liabilities for the year ended december 31 2014 were driven primarily by increases of 7705 million  in our average interestbearing deposit accounts as well as from the new thirdparty debt incurred in connection with the ipo partially offset by a reduction in average borrowings under our securitization programs and our related party debt our cost of funds increased to 169  for the year ended   december 31 2014  from 156  for the year ended   december 31 2013  

interest expense decreased slightly by 3 million or 04 for the year ended december 31 2013 driven by a lower average cost of funds  156  for the year ended december 31 2013 versus 176 for the year ended december 31 2012 this decrease was substantially offset by an increase in average interestbearing liabilities to 47614 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from 42343 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

net interest income 

net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense we expect net interest income as a percentage of interestearning assets to be influenced by changes in the interest rate environment changes in our mix of products the level of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to our standard rates credit performance of our loans and changes in the amount and composition of our interestbearing liabilities 

net interest income increased by 749  million or 71  for the year ended   december 31 2014  driven by growth in loan receivables partially offset by higher interest expense and a decrease in our yield on interestearning assets due to a higher average interestearning cash and equivalents balance 

net interest income increased by 1007 million or 105 for the year ended december 31 2013 driven primarily by an increase in average interestearning receivables 

retailer share arrangements 

most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products although the share arrangements vary by partner these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program based typically on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold the threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on among other things agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses and therefore increases in our actual expenses such as funding costs or operating expenses may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have increased in recent years both in absolute terms and as a proportion of interest income partially as a result of the growth of our receivables related to programs with retailer share arrangements and improvements in the credit performance of these receivables in addition we have made changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years that have contributed to the increase in payments to partners pursuant to retailer share arrangements 

we believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners’ interests with ours we also believe that changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have contributed to the increase in our retailer share arrangement payments will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease and mitigate the impact on our profitability in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements 

retailer share arrangements increased by 202  million or 85  for the year ended   december 31 2014  driven by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements including the effect of a lower provision for loan losses the increase was also driven by changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended program agreements in the second half of 2013 and in 2014 

retailer share arrangements increased by 389 million or 196 for the year ended december 31 2013 this increase was driven by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements as well as by changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended program agreements in 2013 

provision for loan losses 

provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at each period end date provision for loan losses in each period is a function of net chargeoffs gross chargeoffs net of recoveries and the required level of the allowance for loan losses during 2012 we began a process to enhance our allowance for loan losses methodology by revising our estimates to determine the incurred loss period for each type of loss ie aged fraud deceased settlement other nonaged and bankruptcy by partner this enhancement resulted in a more granular portfolio segmentation analysis by loss type included a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the portfolio’s allowance for loan losses which compared the allowance for losses to projected net chargeoffs over the next 12 months in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance and was designed to provide a better estimate of the date of a probable loss event and length of time required for a probable loss event to result in a chargeoff we continue to review and evaluate our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use and we will implement further enhancements or changes to them as needed 

provision for loan losses decreased by 155 million  or 50  for the year ended   december 31 2014  this decrease was driven primarily as a result of an incremental provision of 642 million recorded in 2013 relating to the enhancements to our allowance for loan loss methodology which was not repeated in the current period this decrease was partially offset by increased provisions in 2014 primarily related to portfolio growth our allowance coverage ratio allowance for loan losses as a percent of periodend loan receivables increased to 528  at december 31 2014 as compared to 505  at december 31 2013  reflecting a transition to a stable credit outlook at december 31 2014  from an improving outlook at december 31 2013  

provision for loan losses increased by 507 million or 198 for the year ended december 31 2013 this increase was driven primarily by the enhancements to our allowance for loan loss methodology referred to above and loan receivables growth which was offset in part by lower provisions as a result of improvements to our delinquency and chargeoff rates 

other income 



interchange revenue   

we earn interchange fees on dual card transactions outside of our partners’ locations based on a flat fee plus a percent of the purchase amount we also process general purpose card transactions for some payment solutions and carecredit partners as their acquiring bank for which we obtain an interchange fee growth in interchange revenue has been and is expected to continue to be driven primarily by growth in our dual card product 

interchange revenue increased by 65 million  or 201  for the year ended december 31 2014 and by 37 million or 129 for the year ended december 31 2013 due to increases in dual card purchase volume outside of our retail partners sales channels 

debt cancellation fees 

debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance in return we will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events in october 2012 we ceased debt cancellation product sales via phone calls to our customer service department and began to only offer the product online and on a limited basis by direct mail which has led to a decrease in new enrollments for this product and is expected to result in a lower level of income generated by this product in the future as the balances of existing accounts enrolled in this program decrease over time 

debt cancellation fees decreased by 49 million  or 151  for the year ended december 31 2014 driven by fewer customers being enrolled in the product 

debt cancellation fees increased by 15 million or 49 for the year ended december 31 2013 driven primarily by higher average account balances of customers that had purchased our debt cancellation product 

loyalty programs 

we operate a number of loyalty programs in our retail card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty these programs typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a preset spending level on their private label or dual card other programs provide cash back or reward points which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards growth in loyalty program payments has been and is expected to continue to be driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs 

loyalty programs cost increased by 68 million  or 319  for the year ended december 31 2014 arising from the launch of new rewards programs with our partners and growth in existing loyalty programs purchase volume 

loyalty programs cost increased by 14 million or 70 for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to increased purchase volume 

other 

other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees and investment gainslosses 

other increased by 37 million  or 569  for the year ended   december 31 2014  primarily due to a 46 million gain recorded in connection with portfolio sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 

other decreased by 22 million or 253 for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to lower ancillary fees 

other expense 



employee costs 

employee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs 

employee costs increased by 168 million  or 241  for the year ended december 31 2014 and by 78 million or 126 for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily related to additional compensation expenses for new employees related to the building of our standalone infrastructure and to support business growth and salary increases for existing employees 

professional fees   

professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees eg collection agencies and call centers legal accounting and consulting fees and recruiting expenses 

professional fees increased by 121 million  or 249  for the year ended december 31 2014 these expense increases were due to higher professional and other consulting fees related to the ipo our planned separation from ge growth of the retail deposit platform and other business growth eg increased active accounts and increased purchase volumes 

professional fees increased by 35 million or 78 for the year ended december 31 2013 these expense increases were driven primarily by our business growth 

marketing and business development 

marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing spend as well as amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions 

marketing and business development costs increased by 191 million  or 710  for the year ended december 31 2014 due to increased marketing expenses for our programs investments in our brand including the launch of our new advertising campaign and increased amortization expense associated with program acquisitions and extensions 

marketing and business development costs increased by 61 million or 293 for the year ended december 31 2013 due to increased contractual marketing expenses under our program agreements resulting from growth in the business 

information processing 

information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers credit card associations and software licensing agreements 

information processing costs increased by 19 million  or 98  for the year ended december 31 2014 due to higher transaction volume and increased software licensing and maintenance expense 

information processing costs increased by 28 million or 170 for the year ended december 31 2013 due to higher transaction volume and associated outsourcing fees 

other 

other primarily consists of corporate overhead allocations postage fraud expense litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other smaller cost items such as facilities leases and maintenance leased equipment and telephone charges as discussed under “ —services and funding provided by ge ” prior to the ipo ge provided certain services to us which we allocated to corporate overhead unless the costs associated with such services were directly billed and included in the appropriate cost categories eg employee benefit costs are included in employee costs above postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing option fraud is driven primarily by the number of our dual card active accounts 

the “other” component decreased for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily due to lower corporate overhead allocations and assessments from gecc and a decrease in litigation and regulatory expense these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expense driven by business growth following the ipo we no longer receive corporate overhead allocations and assessments from gecc all services provided by gecc to us following the ipo are directly billed to us in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreement and are included in the appropriate cost categories see note 16  related party transactions to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our transactions with ge and gecc 

the “other” component increased for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to an increase in litigation and regulatory matters expense of 133 million our litigation and regulatory matters expense increased in 2013 as we settled a carecredit investigation pursuant to which we will pay up to 341 million as well as increased reserves for other regulatory matters 

provision for income taxes 

we are included in the consolidated us federal and state income tax returns of ge where applicable but also file certain separate state and foreign income tax returns the tax provision is presented on a separate company basis as if we were a separate filer the effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in our consolidated and combined financial statements in the period to which they relate as if we were a separate filer our current obligations for taxes are settled with our parent on an estimated basis and adjusted in later periods as appropriate and are reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements in the periods in which those settlements occur we recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws see “ critical accounting estimates—income taxes ” for a discussion of the significant judgments and estimates related to income taxes 

our effective tax rate increased to 377  from 370  for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013 respectively the effective tax rate for the year ended   december 31 2014  differs from the effective tax rate in the previous year primarily due to changes in state reserves certain nondeductible expenses in the current year and an item related to an internal corporate reorganization in the year ended december 31 2014 in each period the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 primarily due to state income taxes 

platform analysis 

as discussed above under “ —our sales platforms ” we offer our products through three sales platforms retail card payment solutions and carecredit which management measures based on their revenuegenerating activities the following is a discussion of the platform revenue for each of our platforms 

nongaap measure 

in order to assess and internally report the revenue performance of our three sales platforms we use a measure we refer to as “platform revenue” platform revenue is the sum of three line items in our consolidated and combined statements of earnings prepared in accordance with gaap “interest and fees on loans” plus “other income” less “retailer share arrangements” platform revenue itself is not a measure presented in accordance with gaap we deduct retailer share arrangements but do not deduct other line item expenses such as interest expense provision for loan losses and other expense because those items are managed for the business as a whole we believe that platform revenue is a useful measure to investors because it represents management’s view of the net revenue contribution of each of our platforms this measure should not be considered a substitute for interest and fees on loans or other measures of performance we have reported in accordance with gaap the reconciliation of platform revenue to interest and fees on loans for each platform is set forth in the table included in the discussion of each of our three platforms below the following table sets forth the reconciliation of total platform revenue to total interest and fees on loans for the periods indicated 



retail card 

the following table sets forth supplemental information related to our retail card platform for the periods indicated 



retail card platform revenue increased by 512 million  or 80  for the year ended   december 31 2014  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest and fees on loans driven by an increase in average loan receivables partially offset by increases in retailer share arrangement payments the increases in these payments were driven by the factors discussed under the heading “ retailer share arrangements ” above 

retail card platform revenue increased by 417 million or 70 for the year ended december 31 2013 this increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest and fees on loans driven by an increase in average loan receivables offset in part by an increase in retailer share arrangement payments as a result of program growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements as well as changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended programs agreements in 2013

services and funding provided by ge 

 

services provided by ge 

following the ipo ge owns approximately 846 of our common stock and continues to provide a variety of services to us which are governed by the tsa and various other agreements with ge and gecc that we entered into in connection with the ipo the services provided include among other things employee benefits and benefit administration information technology telecommunication services and leases for vehicles equipment and facilities under the tsa all of the costs billed to us by ge subsequent to the ipo are at ge’s cost in accordance with historic billing methodologies we expect the majority of the services provided by ge will be replaced within two years from the closing date of the ipo

loan receivables 

 

the following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio 

loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenues the following table sets forth the composition of our loan receivables portfolio by product type at the dates indicated 



loan receivables increased by 4032 million  or 70  at december 31 2014  compared to december 31 2013 driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth 

our loan receivables portfolio had the following maturity distribution at december 31 2014  



 

 our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at december 31 2014  



 

 

impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings 

our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions principal forgiveness extensions or other actions which may cause the related loan to be classified as a troubled debt restructuring “tdr” and also be impaired we use shortterm 3 to 12 months or longterm 12 to 60 months modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve longterm collectability of the loans that are classified as tdrs for our credit card customers the shortterm program primarily consists of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction both lasting for a period no longer than 12 months the longterm program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan the longterm program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments we also make loan modifications for some customers who request financial assistance through external sources such as a consumer credit counseling agency program the loans that are modified typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal interest or fees the determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions meet the tdr criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances 

loans classified as tdrs are recorded at their present value with impairment measured as the difference between the loan balance and the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan our allowance for loan losses on tdrs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows 

interest income from loans accounted for as tdrs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans we accrue interest on credit card balances until the accounts are chargedoff in the period the accounts become 180 days past due the following table presents the amount of loan receivables that are not accruing interest loans that are 90 days or more pastdue and still accruing interest and earning tdrs for the periods presented 



 

 



delinquencies 

loan delinquencies as a percentage of periodend loan receivables decreased with the over30 day delinquency rate decreasing to 414  at december 31 2014  as compared to 435  at december 31 2013 the 21 basis point decrease compared to the same period in prior year was primarily driven by continued improvement in the us economy and employment rates 

net chargeoffs 

net chargeoffs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible net of recovered amounts we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and thirdparty fraud losses from chargeoffs chargedoff and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while thirdparty fraud losses are included in other expense chargeoffs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses and subsequent recoveries of previously chargedoff amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses costs incurred to recover chargedoff loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our consolidated and combined statements of earnings 

the table below sets forth the ratio of net chargeoffs to average loan receivables including held for sale for the periods indicated 



allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses totaled 3236  million at december 31 2014  compared with 2892 million at december 31 2013 representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the increase in allowance for loan losses was primarily driven by an increase in our expected losses driven by growth in loan receivables 

the following tables provide changes in our allowance for loan losses for the periods presented 













 

 

funding liquidity and capital resources 

 

we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital our funding liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations our business growth our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments 

funding sources 

prior to the ipo we utilized related party debt provided by gecc and its affiliates as a primary funding source in connection with the ipo we repaid the related party debt outstanding at the date of the ipo and entered into new longterm debt arrangements with both third parties and gecc following the ipo our primary funding sources include cash from operations deposits direct and brokered deposits thirdparty debt and securitized financings 

the following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated 



 

 

deposits 

we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers “direct deposits” or through thirdparty brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers “brokered deposits” at december 31 2014  we had 197 billion  in direct deposits which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions and 153 billion  in deposits originated through brokerage firms including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to significantly expand our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding 

our direct deposits include a range of fdicinsured deposit products including certificates of deposit iras money market accounts and savings accounts which we offer under our optimizer plus  brand 

brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms we have relationships with eight  brokers that offer our deposits through their networks our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at december 31 2014  had a weighted average remaining life of 34  years these deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal 

our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to among other things the interest rates we pay and therefore we bear funding and interest rate risk if we fail or are required to pay higher rates to attract new deposits or retain existing deposits to mitigate these risks we pursue a funding strategy that seeks to match our assets and liabilities by interest rate and expected maturity characteristics and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources including securitized financings including our undrawn committed capacity and unsecured debt 

over the next several years we are seeking to increase our direct deposits through investing in our direct deposit programs and capabilities the growth of direct deposits will be supported by a significant investment in marketing and brand awareness 

the following table summarizes certain information regarding our interestbearing deposits by type all of which constitute us deposits for the periods indicated 



 

 our deposit liabilities provide funding with maturities ranging from one day to ten years at december 31 2014  the weighted average maturity of our interestbearing time deposits was 24  years see note 8 deposits  to our consolidated and combined financial statements for more information on their maturities 

the following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity at december 31 2014  



 

 securitized financings 

we have been engaged in the securitization of our credit card receivables since 1997 we access the assetbacked securitization market using the synchrony credit card master note trust “mnt” formerly the ge capital credit card master note trust through which we issue assetbacked securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits in addition we issue assetbacked securities in private transactions through the synchrony sales finance master trust “sft” formerly the ge sales finance master trust and the synchrony receivables trust “srt” formerly the ge money master trust 

at december 31 2014  we had 71 billion of outstanding private assetbacked securities and 79 billion  of outstanding public assetbacked securities in each case held by unrelated third parties 

the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors’ interests in securitized financings at december 31 2014  

 

 we retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through i in the case of mnt sft and srt subordinated retained interests in the receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series to provide credit enhancement for a particular series as well as a pari passu seller’s interest in each trust and ii subordinated classes of mnt notes that we own 

all of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers referred to as early amortization events including events related to material breaches of representations warranties or covenants inability or failure of the bank to transfer loans to the trusts as required under the securitization documents failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents and certain insolvencyrelated events with respect to the related securitization depositor gecc solely with respect to mnt or the bank in addition an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series falls below zero following an early amortization event principal collections on the loans in our trusts are applied to repay principal of the assetbacked securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business the occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred no early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in mnt sft or srt 

the following table summarizes for each of our trusts the threemonth rolling average excess spread at december 31 2014  



 

 thirdparty debt 

bank term loan 

on august 5 2014 we borrowed the full amount under the bank term loan with thirdparty lenders that provided 80 billion principal amount of unsecured term loans maturing in 2019 in august 2014 we prepaid 505 million of the bank term loan using a portion of the net proceeds from our issuance of senior unsecured notes in october 2014 we amended the bank term loan to among other things increase the amount of indebtedness that the company may incur by 750 million and this amount was borrowed in full 

at december 31 2014  the total indebtedness outstanding under the bank term loan was 82 billion  and the weighted average interest rate was 206 subsequent to december 31 2014 we prepaid an additional 25 billion in the aggregate of the bank term loan which included the use of a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in february 2015 the total indebtedness outstanding under the bank term loan following these additional prepayments was 57 billion 

other than certain nonpro rata prepayments permitted to be made to gecc term loan in reliance on guidance received by synchrony the bank or gecc from applicable bank regulatory authorities to satisfy laws regulatory capital or liquidity requirements including for the avoidance of doubt any regulatory requirement or condition necessary to effect the splitoff or the ge slhc deregistration voluntary prepayments of the loans outstanding under the bank term loan shall be made on a pro rata basis with the gecc term loan based on the principal amounts outstanding respectively at the time of such prepayment 

there are no required amortization payments or prepayments of the bank term loan except that we are generally required to prepay the bank term loan and the gecc term loan on a pro rata basis with any cash proceeds received by synchrony net of all incurred fees and expenses from any debt securities issued by synchrony in future in excess of the following amounts which we are entitled to retain i the sum of 500 million plus 20 of any such net debt proceeds in excess of 500 million in each of 2015 and 2016 and ii the sum of 750 million plus 20 of any net debt proceeds in excess of 750 million in each of 2017 2018 and 2019 

senior unsecured notes 

on august 11 2014 we issued a total of 36 billion of senior unsecured notes with various maturities ranging from 2017 through 2024 we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of unsecured senior notes to prepay 505 million of the bank term loan at december 31 2014  the amount outstanding of our senior unsecured notes debt was 36 billion  and the weighted average interest rate on the unsecured notes was 343 

on february 2 2015 we issued a total of 10 billion  principal amount of senior unsecured notes comprising 750 million  aggregate principal amount of 2700  senior notes due 2020 and 250 million  aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2020 all of the net proceeds from this issuance were used to prepay the bank term loan and gecc term loan on a pro rata basis 

related party debt 

prior to our ipo gecc provided the majority of our debt funding we repaid all of our thenexisting related party debt owed to gecc outstanding on the closing date of the ipo totaling 80 billion  and on the closing date of the ipo we borrowed the full amount under the gecc term loan which provided 15 billion  principal amount of unsecured term loan maturing in 2019 during 2014 we used the 750 million of additional borrowings under the bank term loan and a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes to make prepayments in the aggregate of 845 million of the gecc term loan and the balance of related party debt outstanding at december 31 2014 was 655 million  

subsequent to december 31 2014 we made additional prepayments in the aggregate of 206 million which included the use of a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in february 2015 following these prepayments the total indebtedness outstanding under the gecc term loan was 449 million we expect that in connection with our application to the federal reserve board and the separation we will continue to prepay part or substantially all of the remaining outstanding related party debt owed to gecc under the gecc term loan 

other than certain nonpro rata prepayments permitted to be made to the gecc term loan in reliance on certain regulatory guidance received by synchrony the bank or gecc as described above under “ —bank term loan ” all voluntary prepayments of the gecc term loan shall be made on a pro rata basis with the bank term loan there are no required amortizationprepayments of the gecc term loan except that we will be required to prepay the gecc term loan and the bank term loan with certain proceeds of future debt offerings as described above under “ —bank term loan ” 

the aggregate interest and fees incurred with respect to funding provided by gecc to us was 113 million  157 million  and 155 million for the years ended december 31 2014  2013 and 2012 respectively 

shortterm borrowings 

except as described above there were no material shortterm borrowings for the periods presented 

undrawn securitized financings   

at december 31 2014  we had an aggregate of 61 billion  of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under two of our existing securitization programs 

other   

at december 31 2014  we had more than 250 billion  of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window 

offbalance sheet items—guarantees 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet items including guarantees of thirdparty obligations guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a thirdparty based on certain trigger events at december 31 2014  we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our consolidated and combined statements of financial position related to any guarantees 

covenants 

each of the bank term loan and the gecc term loan include a affirmative covenants which among other things require the bank to remain a whollyowned subsidiary of ours and b negative covenants which among other things restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability subject to various exceptions to incur liens incur indebtedness engage in transactions with affiliates amend or prepay the other term loan facility except under the limited circumstances and in the manner specified in the term loan facilities amend the master agreement and enter into certain restrictive agreements the negative covenants also restrict our ability subject to certain exceptions to undergo various fundamental changes including mergers liquidations saleleaseback transactions and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets 

each of the bank term loan and the gecc term loan also contain financial covenants to be tested on a quarterly basis that require i the company and until the company is subject to or elects to report under basel iii the bank to maintain a minimum tier 1 common ratio of not less than 10  calculated in accordance with basel i or basel iii as applicable ii the company to maintain minimum liquidity of not less than 40 billion  and iii the bank to maintain minimum liquidity of not less than 20 billion  each of the bank term loan and the gecc term loan include customary events of default including the occurrence of a change of control which will not be triggered by our separation from ge and the occurrence of certain material adverse regulatory events 

the indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes were issued in august 2014 includes various covenants including covenants that restrict subject to certain exceptions the company’s ability to dispose of or incur liens on any of the voting stock of the bank or otherwise permit the bank to be merged consolidated leased or sold in a manner that results in the bank being less than 80  controlled by us 

if we do not satisfy any of the covenants discussed above the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december 31 2014  

our real estate leases also include various covenants but typically do not include financial covenants if we do not satisfy the covenants in the real estate leases the leases may be terminated and we may be liable for damage claims at december 31 2014  we were not in default under any of our credit facilities and had not received any notices of default under any of our real estate leases 

credit ratings 

our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of the company the bank and the ratings of our assetbacked securities 

our senior unsecured debt issued in august 2014 was rated bbb stable outlook by fitch and bbb stable outlook by sp in addition certain of the assetbacked securities issued by mnt are rated by fitch sp andor moody’s a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets 

liquidity 

 

we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under normal and stress conditions 

we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business which is the responsibility of our asset and liability management committee a subcommittee of our enterprise risk management committee we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process we evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs 

we maintain a liquidity portfolio which at december 31 2014  had 129 billion  of liquid assets primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and shortterm obligations of the us treasury less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid compared to a 21 billion liquidity portfolio at december 31 2013 the increase in liquid assets was primarily due to the proceeds from the ipo and related debt financings and also the retention of excess cash and equivalents from operations within our company 

as additional sources of liquidity at december 31 2014  we had an aggregate of 61 billion  of undrawn committed capacity subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under two of our existing securitization programs and we had more than 250 billion  of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window 

our liquidity portfolio consists of cash and equivalents primarily in the form of deposits with the federal reserve bank and shortterm obligations of the us treasury as a general matter investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash the level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions 

we will rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity however bank regulations contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the bank’s ability to pay dividends see “ item 1a   risk factors—risks relating to regulation—we and the bank are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock ” and “ regulation—savings association regulation—dividends and stock repurchases ” 

capital 

 

our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our businesses and existing equity capital the proceeds from the ipo have increased our equity capital significantly we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our businesses meet regulatory requirements adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments within these constraints we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders 

in connection with our separation from ge and the related application to the federal reserve board which we will be required to make we expect to continue to increase our capital levels by among other things retaining net earnings and by not paying a dividend or returning capital through stock repurchases until our application to the federal reserve board is approved as part of our capital plan thereafter our board of directors intends to consider our policy for paying dividends and may consider stock repurchases we are targeting tier 1 common ratios well in excess of regulatory “wellcapitalized” levels we measure capital ratios under the basel i framework and believe we are well positioned to manage our capital ratios as we transition to basel iii requirements in 2015 

the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including the financial condition earnings capital and liquidity requirements of us and the bank regulatory restrictions including any restrictions that may be imposed in connection with our separation from ge corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make repurchases of our stock for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on our and the bank’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock see “ risk factors—risks relating to regulation—we and the bank are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock ” there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any stock in the future 

regulatory capital requirements  synchrony financial 

as a savings and loan holding company we historically have not been required to maintain any specific amount of minimum capital beginning as early as 2015 however we expect that we will be subject to capital requirements under the applicable us basel iii capital rules for more information see “ regulation—savings and loan holding company regulation ” 

the following table sets forth at december 31 2014  the composition of our capital ratios for the company under basel i 



 

 at december 31 2014  we had an estimated fully phasedin basel iii tier 1 common ratio of 145  

nongaap measures 

as a new savings and loan holding company the company historically has not been required by regulators to disclose capital ratios and therefore these capital ratios are nongaap measures we believe these capital ratios are useful measures to investors because they are widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies although our basel i tier 1 common ratio is not a basel i defined regulatory capital ratio and our basel i and basel iii tier 1 common ratios may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies our basel i tier 1 common ratio is the ratio of tier 1 common equity as calculated below to total riskweighted assets as calculated in accordance with the us basel i capital rules our basel iii tier 1 common ratio is the ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to total riskweighted assets each as calculated in accordance with the us basel iii capital rules on a fully phasedin basis our basel iii tier 1 common ratio is a preliminary estimate reflecting management’s interpretation of the final basel iii capital rules adopted in july 2013 by the federal reserve board which have not been fully implemented and our estimate and interpretations are subject to among other things ongoing regulatory review and implementation guidance the following tables set forth a reconciliation of each component of our capital ratios set forth above to the comparable gaap component at december 31 2014  





 

 regulatory capital requirements  synchrony bank 

under the bank’s operating agreement with the occ which it entered into on january 11 2013 in connection with its acquisition of the deposit business of metlife and regulatory capital requirements adopted by the occ the bank must maintain minimum levels of capital which are higher than those required under basel i requirements 

the following table sets forth the composition of the bank’s capital ratios at the dates indicated 





failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see “ risk factors—risks relating to regulation—failure by synchrony the bank and until the ge slhc deregistration gecc to meet applicable capital adequacy rules could have a material adverse effect on us ” 

contractual obligations 

 

in the normal course of business we enter into various contractual obligations that require future cash payments our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations at december 31 2014 are summarized 

below 

 

 critical accounting estimates 

 

in preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties the critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for loan losses asset impairment income taxes and fair value measurements many of these estimates include determining fair value all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables future impairments of investment securities goodwill and intangible assets and the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities among other effects see note 2 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated and combined financial statements which discusses the significant accounting policies related to these estimates 

allowance for loan losses 

losses on loan receivables are recognized when they are incurred which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio the method for calculating the best estimate of probable losses takes into account our historical experience adjusted for current conditions with each product and customer type and our judgment concerning the probable effects of relevant observable data trends and market factors 

we evaluate each portfolio quarterly for credit card receivables our estimation process includes analysis of historical data and there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance our risk process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or on a portfolio basis as appropriate more specifically we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables we use other analyses to estimate losses incurred on nondelinquent accounts the considerations in these analyses include past performance risk management techniques applied to various accounts historical behavior of different account vintages current economic conditions recent trends in delinquencies bankruptcy filings account collection management policy changes account seasoning loan volume and amounts payment rates forecasting uncertainties and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for losses which compares this allowance for losses to projected net chargeoffs over the next 12 months in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance we do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis but instead estimate its allowance for credit card loan losses on a portfolio basis further experience is not available for new portfolios therefore while we are developing that experience we set loss allowances based on our experience with the most closely analogous products in our portfolio changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates 

asset impairment 

investments 

we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria for debt securities if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows for equity securities our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we do not amortize goodwill but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is defined under gaap as the operating segment or one level below that operating segment the component level if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management our operating segment consists of a single reporting unit based on the level at which management regularly reviews and measures the business operating results 

goodwill impairment risk is first assessed under fasb accounting standards update “asu” 201108 intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment  by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors for our reporting unit if potential goodwill impairment risk exists that indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value we apply a twostep quantitative test the first step compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of our reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step is applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill is considered impaired and reduced to its implied fair value the qualitative assessment for each period presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements was performed without hindsight assuming only factors and market conditions existing as of those dates and resulted in no potential goodwill impairment risk for our reporting unit consequently goodwill was not deemed to be impaired for any of the periods presented 

definitelived intangible assets principally consist of customerrelated assets including contract acquisitions and purchased credit card relationships these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable the evaluation compares the cash inflows expected to be generated from each intangible asset to its carrying value if cash flows attributable to the intangible asset are less than the carrying value the asset is considered impaired and written down to its estimated fair value no impairments of definitelived intangible assets have been recognized in the periods presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements 

income taxes 

we are subject to income tax in the united states federal state and local as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate our provision for income tax expense is based on our income the statutory tax rates and other provisions of the tax laws applicable to us in each of these various jurisdictions these laws are complex and their application to our facts is at times open to interpretation the process of determining our consolidated income tax expense includes significant judgments and estimates including judgments regarding the interpretation of those laws our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities incorporate those judgments and estimates and reflect management’s best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities as well as the impact of tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks and are measured using the enacted income tax laws and rates that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are specific to the jurisdiction in which they arise and are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization of those assets is “more likely than not” in making decisions regarding our ability to realize tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income taxable income in carryback periods expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the implementation of available tax planning strategies these decisions rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and our short and longrange business forecasts to provide insight 

fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes”  “fin 48” now part of asc 740 income taxes  establishes the framework by which we determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to be maintained for uncertain income tax positions applying this framework we recognize the financial statement impact of uncertain income tax positions when we conclude that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits of a position that the position will be sustained upon examination in certain situations we establish a liability that represents the difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return and the amount of taxes recognized in our financial statements we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and provision for income taxes respectively 

fair value measurements 

assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances primarily include loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral and cost method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired 

assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs a fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued 

new accounting standards 

 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap when it becomes effective the new standard is effective on january 1 2017 early application is not permitted the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective cumulative effect transition method we are evaluating the effect that asu 201409 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures we have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates see “ item 1a risk factors—risks relating to our business—changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings funding and liquidity ” and “ —a reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets ” 

interest rate risk   

we borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income and our interest expense to increase or decrease as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is the prime rate and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either libor or the federal funds rate the prime rate and the libor or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities 

competitive factors may limit and future regulatory reform may limit or restrict our ability to raise interest rates fixed or floating on our loans in addition some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers under those agreements if interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner our net interest margin could be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us our floating rate products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowances for loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 

changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity 

to manage interest rate risk we generally pursue a match funding strategy pursuant to which we seek to match the interest rate repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities at december 31 2014 568  of our loan receivables bore a fixed interest rate to the customer and we have historically funded these assets with fixed rate certificates of deposit securitized financing and unsecured debt at december 31 2014 432  of our loan receivables bore a floating interest rate to the customer and we generally fund these assets with floating rate deposits securitized financing and unsecured debt historically we have not used interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk to the extent we are unable to effectively match the interest rates on our assets and liabilities including in the future potentially through the use of derivatives our net earnings could be materially adversely affected 

we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our net earnings of various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes 

for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates over the 12month period from our reporting date we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period the sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously simultaneously and to the same degree 

our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity portfolio at december 31 2014 432  of our receivables bore a floating interest rate assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature or otherwise contractually reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12month period are considered to be rate sensitive the latter category includes certain loans that may be offered at belowmarket rates for an introductory period such as balance transfers and special promotional programs after which the loans will contractually reprice under standard terms in accordance with our normal marketbased pricing structure for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice for assets that have a fixed interest rate at the period end but which contractually will or are assumed to reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 

interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12month period thus liabilities that vary with changes in a marketbased index such as the federal funds rate or libor which will reset before the end of the 12month period or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a marketbased indexed rate prior to the end of the 12month period also are considered to be rate sensitive for these fixed rate liabilities earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 

assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december 31 2014 we estimate that net interest income over the following 12month period would increase by approximately 45 million  

limitations of market risk measures   

the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information internallydeveloped assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments other market inputs such as interest rates market prices and interest rate volatility are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures we regularly evaluate update and enhance these assumptions models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities 

there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates the sensitivity analysis provided above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet it does not attempt to estimate the effect of a more significant interest rate increase over a sustained period of time which as described in “ —interest rate risk ” above could adversely affect our net interest margin in addition the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ from our projections which could cause our actual earnings to differ from the above sensitivity analysis
