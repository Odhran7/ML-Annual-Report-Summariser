information with respect to our business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials we purchase raw materials subassemblies components and other supplies needed in our operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and internationally the principal raw materials and supplies used in our operations include stainless and carbon steel organic and inorganic chemicals fuel and plastic components these raw materials and supplies are generally available from several suppliers and in sufficient quantities however in fiscal 2022 we have experienced delays in receiving materials and significant cost increases that we expect will continue in fiscal 2023 we do not currently expect any significant disruption to our operations due to sourcing problems in fiscal 2023 we have longterm supply contracts for certain materials for which there are few suppliers or those that are singlesourced in certain regions of the world such as ethylene oxide eo and cobalt60 which are necessary to our ast operations in addition we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with acceleratorbased technologies which may reduce the potential supply risk 

in response to the active conflict between russian and ukraine we have stopped purchasing cobalt60 from our russian supplier a longterm disruption in cobalt60 sourced from russia may negatively impact gamma processing capacity or increase costs in certain portions of our ast operations but these impacts are not expected to be material to our ast segment and its results of operations for additional information about the risks we face concerning the conflict between russia and ukraine see part i item 1a of this annual report titled risk factors 

inflation historically our business has not been significantly impacted by the overall effects of inflation however during fiscal 2022 we experienced a rise in supply chain and labor costs and anticipate continued supply chain and inflation pressure in fiscal 2023 we monitor the prices we charge for our products and services on an ongoing basis and plan to adjust those prices to take into account future changes in the rate of inflation 

intellectual property we protect our technology and products by among other means obtaining united states and foreign patents there can be no assurance however that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology system product service or process it covers in addition the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive 

we also rely upon trade secrets technical knowhow and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our co mpetitive position 

as of march 31 2022 we held approximately 566 united states patents and approximately 2346 in other jurisdictions and had approximately 188 united states patent applications and 428 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained the actual protection a patent provides varies from country to country and depends in part upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in each country 

our products are sold around the world under various brand names and trademarks we consider our brand names and trademarks to be valuable in the marketing of our products as of march 31 2022 we had a total of approximately 2463 trademark registrations worldwide 

quality assurance we manufacture assemble and package products in several countries each of our production facilities are dedicated to particular processes and products our success depends upon customer confidence in the quality of our production process and the integrity of the data that supports our product safety and effectiveness we have implemented quality assurance procedures to support the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes 

government regulation our business is subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate in the united states the food and drug administration “fda” the environmental protection agency “epa” the occupational safety and health administration osha the nuclear regulatory commission “nrc” and other governmental authorities regulate the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products and services our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation including countryspecific rules and regulations and us regulations applicable to our international operations government regulations require detailed inspection of and controls over research and development clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing marketing and promotion sampling distribution recordkeeping storage and disposal practices 

compliance with applicable regulations is a significant expense for us past current or future regulations their interpretation or their application could have a material adverse impact on our operations also additional governmental regulation may be passed that could prevent delay revoke or result in the rejection of regulatory clearance of our products we cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulation or the interpretation or application of these regulations 

if we fail to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements penalties could be imposed on us for more information about the risks we face regarding regulatory requirements see part i item 1a of this annual report titled risk factors we are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations failure to receive or maintain or delays in receiving clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues profitability financial condition or value 

in the past we have received warning letters paid civil penalties conducted product recalls and field corrections and been subject to other regulatory penalties we believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements however there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory governmental or private action will not have a material adverse affect on us or on our performance results or financial condition 

environmental matters we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in ireland the united states and other countries we have made and continue to make significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations we cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations we believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental health and safety requirements in all material respects however there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory governmental or private action will not have a material adverse affect on our performance results or financial condition please refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled commitments and contingencies for further information 

in the future if a loss contingency related to environmental matters employee safety health or conditional asset retirement obligations is significantly greater than the current estimated amount we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded the investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition liquidity or cash flow nor can there be any assurance that such liabilities would not have a material adverse affect on our performance results or financial condition 

competition the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and generally highly regulated competition is intense in all of our business segments and includes many large and small competitors brand design quality safety ease of use serviceability price product features warranty delivery service and technical support are important competitive factors to us we expect to face continued competition in the future as new infection prevention sterile processing contamination control gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market we believe many organizations are working with a variety of technologies and sterilizing agents also a number of companies have developed disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination 

we believe that our longterm competitive position depends on our success in discovering developing and marketing innovative costeffective products and services we devote significant resources to research and development efforts and we believe steris is positioned as a global competitor in the search for technological innovations in addition to research and development we invest in quality control customer training programs distribution systems technical services and other information services 

there can be no assurance that we will develop significant new products or services or that the new products or services we provide or develop in the future will be more commercially successful than those provided or developed by our competitors in addition some of our existing or potential competitors may have greater resources than us therefore a competitor may succeed in developing and commercializing products more rapidly than we do competition as it relates to our business segments and product categories is discussed in more detail in the section above titled “information related to business segments”

 item 1a risk factors 

this section describes certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations you should consider these risk factors when evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because our actual results and financial condition might differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements should these risks occur we face other risks besides those highlighted below these other risks include additional uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial but may ultimately have a significant impact in addition the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate any of these risks which could have a material effect on us although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated should any of these risks described below or otherwise actually occur our business financial condition performance prospects value or results of operations could be negatively affected 

legal regulatory and tax risks 

doing business internationally 

compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting international laws and regulations import and export limitations anticorruption laws and exchange controls may be difficult burdensome or expensive 

we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to limitations on trade with persons in sanctioned countries while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot assure you that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics 

changes in economic climate may adversely affect us 

adverse economic cycles or conditions and customer regulatory or government response to those cycles or conditions have affected and could further affect our results of operations the onset of these cycles or conditions may not be foreseeable and there can be no assurance when they will begin to improve after they occur there also can be no assurance as to the strength or length of any recovery from a business downturn or recession credit and liquidity problems may make it difficult for some businesses to access credit markets and obtain financing and may cause some businesses to curtail spending to conserve cash in anticipation of persistent business slowdowns and liquidity needs if our customers have difficulty financing their purchases due to tight credit markets or related factors or because of other operational or utilization problems they may be experiencing or otherwise decide to curtail their purchases our business could be adversely affected our exposure to bad debt losses could also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered and delivered 

some of our customers are governmental entities or other entities that rely on government healthcare systems or government funding if government funding for healthcare becomes limited or restricted in countries in which we operate including as a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic our customers may be unable to pay their obligations on a timely basis or to make payment in full and it may become necessary to increase reserves in addition there can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in collection difficulties prospectively additional adverse effects resulting from these conditions may include decreased healthcare utilization further pricing pressure on our products and services andor weaker overall demand for our products and services particularly capital products 

our acquisition activity and ability to grow organically may be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to access the financial markets  

our recent acquisitions have been financed largely through cash on hand and borrowings under our bank credit facilities and through public note offerings in early april of fiscal 2022 future acquisitions or other capital requirements will necessitate additional cash to the extent our existing sources of cash are insufficient to fund these or other future activities we have and may need to raise additional funds through new or expanded borrowing arrangements or equity there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds beyond those available under existing bank credit facilities on terms favorable to us or at all or that such facilities can be replaced when they terminate 

the current military conflict between russia and ukraine and its implications on us canadian and european union relations with russia could cause long term geopolitical and economic instability that may impact our future operating results 

in response to the military conflict between russia and ukraine that began in february 2022 the united states other north atlantic treaty organization member states as well as nonmember states announced targeted economic sanctions on russia the longterm impact on our business resulting from the disruption of trade in the region caused by the conflict and associated sanctions and boycotts is uncertain at this time due to the fluid nature of the ongoing military conflict and response the potential impacts include supply chain and logistics disruptions financial impacts including volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates increased inflationary pressure on raw materials and energy and other risks including an elevated risk of 

cybersecurity threats and the potential for further sanctions we have stopped operating in russia and belarus which includes shipments to customers and purchases of cobalt60 from our russian supplier our operations located in the region did not represent a material portion of our consolidated assets or revenues a longterm disruption in cobalt60 sourced from russia may negatively impact gamma processing capacity or increase costs in certain portions of our ast operations but these impacts are not expected to be material to our ast segment and its results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic disrupted our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if further significant disruptions occur 

the covid19 pandemic along with the response to the pandemic by governmental and other actors disrupted our operations we experienced temporary mandatory and voluntary facility closures in certain jurisdictions in which we operate furthermore we have experienced less demand for certain of our products and services as a result of deferrals of certain medical procedures and other factors which we believe was exacerbated by the impact of stayathome orders additionally the covid19 outbreak has caused temporary disruptions and rising costs in our supply chain and distribution network 

longterm facility closures or other restrictions could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff supply or otherwise maintain our operations such restrictions also may have a substantial impact on our customers and our sales cycles the covid19 pandemic may put pressure on overall spending for our products and services and may cause our customers to modify spending priorities or delay or abandon purchasing decisions moreover because a large number of our employees have been and will continue to work from home routinely we may be subject to increased vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks we have modified and may further modify our business practices in response to the risks and negative impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic however there can be no assurance that these measures will be temporary or successful 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate duration severity and disruption to our business customers and supply chain and the related financial impact to us cannot be accurately forecasted at this time should such additional significant disruptions occur and continue for an extended period the adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition could be more severe additionally weak economic conditions the pace for economic recovery and rising inflation could result in extended weak demand for our products and services furthermore future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks discussed above 

healthcare laws and reimbursement 

changes in healthcare laws or government and other thirdparty payor reimbursement levels to healthcare providers or failure to meet healthcare reimbursement or other requirements might negatively impact our business 

we sell many of our products and services to hospitals and other healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers many of these customers are subject to or supported by government programs or receive reimbursement for services from thirdparty payors such as government programs including medicare and medicaid in the us private insurance plans and managed care programs reimbursement systems vary significantly by country governmentmanaged healthcare systems control reimbursement for healthcare services in many countries public budgetary constraints may significantly impact the ability of hospitals pharmaceutical manufacturers and other customers supported by such systems to purchase our products government or other thirdparty payors may deny or change coverage reduce their current levels of reimbursement for healthcare services or otherwise implement measures to regulate pricing or contain costs in addition our costs may increase more rapidly than reimbursement levels or permissible pricing increases or we may not satisfy the standards or requirements for reimbursement 

among other provisions the us patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act imposed an excise tax on medical devices manufactured or offered for sale in the united states late in 2019 us congress enacted legislation that repealed the excise tax which had been suspended during calendar years 2016 through 2019 in addition we have been required to commit significant resources to “sunshine act” compliance various additional health care reform proposals have emerged at the federal and state level and we are unable to predict which if any of those proposals will be enacted 

product and service related regulations and claims 

we are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations failure to receive or maintain or delays in receiving clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues profitability financial condition or value 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation in the countries where we do business in the united states our products and services are regulated by the fda and other regulatory authorities in many foreign countries sales of our products and services are subject to extensive regulations that may or may not be comparable to those of the fda in europe our products are regulated primarily by country and community regulations of those countries within the european economic area and must conform to the requirements of those authorities 

government regulation applies to nearly all aspects of testing manufacturing safety labeling storing recordkeeping reporting promoting distributing and importing or exporting of medical devices products and services in general unless an exemption applies a sterilization decontamination or medical device or product or service must receive regulatory approval or clearance before it can be marketed or sold modifications to existing products or the marketing of new uses for existing products also may require regulatory approvals approval supplements or clearances if we are unable to obtain any required approvals approval supplements or clearances for any modification to a previously cleared or approved device we may be required to cease manufacturing and sale or recall or restrict the use of such modified device pay fines or take other action until such time as appropriate clearance or approval is obtained 

regulatory agencies may refuse to grant approval or clearance or review and disagree with our interpretation of approvals or clearances or with our decision that regulatory approval is not required or has been maintained regulatory submissions may require the provision of additional data and may be time consuming and costly and their outcome is uncertain regulatory agencies may also change policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay approval or clearance of devices or could impact our ability to market a previously cleared approved or unregulated device our failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda or other applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or elsewhere might subject us to administratively or judicially imposed sanctions these sanctions include among others warning letters fines civil penalties criminal penalties injunctions debarment product seizure or detention product recalls and total or partial suspension of production sale andor promotion 

the covid19 pandemic may disrupt the operations of regulatory bodies with responsibility for oversight of healthcare and health and medical products such disruptions could result in the focus and prioritization of regulatory resources on emergent matters which could divert regulatory resources away from more routine regulatory matters that are not covid19 related but that have the potential to impact our business for example there could be delays in fda review of applications for marketing authorization including those which may be necessary for or in connection with proposed changes to our products or the changes to the processes by which they are manufactured it is unknown how long these disruptions could continue were they to occur any elongation or deprioritization or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect our ongoing device design development and commercialization plans 

our products are subject to recalls and restrictions even after receiving united states or foreign regulatory clearance or approval 

ongoing medical device reporting regulations require that we report to appropriate governmental authorities in the united states andor other countries when our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur governmental authorities can require product recalls or impose restrictions for product design manufacturing labeling clearance or other issues for the same reasons we may voluntarily elect to recall or restrict the use of a product any recall or restriction could divert managerial and financial resources and might harm our reputation among our customers and other healthcare professionals who use or recommend our products and services 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims or other legal actions or regulatory or compliance matters  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions a significant increase in the number severity amount or scope of these claims and actions may as described above with respect to recalls and restrictions result in substantial costs and harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect product sales and our business product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions may also distract management from other business responsibilities 

we are also subject to a variety of other types of claims proceedings investigations and litigation initiated by government agencies or third parties and other potential risks and liabilities these include compliance matters product regulation or safety taxes employee benefit plans employment discrimination health and safety environmental antitrust customs importexport government contract compliance financial controls or reporting intellectual property allegations of misrepresentation false claims or false statements commercial claims claims regarding promotion of our products and services or other similar or different matters any such claims proceedings investigations or litigation regardless of the merits might result in substantial costs restrictions on product use or sales or otherwise injure our business 

administratively or judicially imposed or agreed sanctions might include warning letters fines civil penalties criminal penalties loss of tax benefits injunctions product seizure recalls suspensions or restrictions relabeling detention andor debarment we also might be required to take actions such as payment of substantial amounts or revision of financial statements or to take or be subject to the following types of actions with respect to our products services or business redesign relabel restrict or recall products cease manufacturing and selling products seizure of product inventory comply with a court injunction restricting or prohibiting further marketing and sale of products or services comply with a consent decree which could result in further regulatory constraints dedication of significant internal and external resources and costs to respond to and comply with legal and regulatory issues and constraints respond to claims litigation and other proceedings brought by customers users governmental agencies and others disruption of product improvements and product launches discontinuation of certain product lines or services or other restrictions or limitations on product sales use or operation or other activities or business practices 

some product replacements or substitutions may not be possible or may be prohibitively costly or time consuming the impact of any legal regulatory or compliance claims proceeding investigation or litigation is difficult to predict 

we maintain product liability and other insurance with coverages believed to be adequate however product liability or other claims may exceed insurance coverage limits fines penalties and regulatory sanctions may not be covered by insurance or insurance may not continue to be available or available on commercially reasonable terms additionally our insurers might deny claim coverage for valid or other reasons or may become insolvent 

our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by difficulties in acquiring or maintaining a proprietary intellectual ownership position 

to maintain our competitive position for our products we need to obtain patent or other proprietary rights for new and improved products and to maintain and enforce our existing patents and other proprietary rights we typically apply for patents in the united states and in strategic other countries we may also acquire patents through acquisitions we may encounter difficulties in obtaining or protecting patents 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology these measures afford only limited protection and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information litigation may be necessary to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights litigation may also be brought against us claiming that we have violated the intellectual property rights of others litigation may be costly and may divert management’s attention from other matters additionally in some foreign countries with weaker intellectual property rights it may be difficult to maintain and enforce patents and other proprietary rights or defend against claims of infringement 

tax risks 

we might be adversely impacted by tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions 

we are subject to the tax laws at the federal state or provincial and local government levels in the many jurisdictions in which we operate or sell products or services tax laws might change in ways that adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate and cash flow the tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we are subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions that might assess additional tax liabilities against us our tax reporting positions might be challenged by relevant tax authorities we might incur significant expense in our efforts to defend those challenges and we might be unsuccessful in those efforts developments in examinations and challenges might materially change our provision for taxes in the affected periods and might differ materially from our historical tax accruals any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations our cash flows and our financial position or results of operations 

current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction subject to significant change 

the us tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” was signed into law on december 22 2017 guidance continues to be issued clarifying the application of this new legislation and new changes have been proposed in the us that could increase our total tax expense we cannot predict the overall impact that the additional guidance and proposed changes may have on our business some jurisdictions have raised tax rates and it is reasonable to expect that other global taxing authorities will be reviewing current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the tcja current economic conditions and covid19 response costs 

in addition further changes in the tax laws of other jurisdictions could arise including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting b eps project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries has issued recommendations that in some cases would make substantial changes to numerous longstanding tax positions and principles these contemplated changes to the extent adopted by oecd members andor other countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

our tax rate is uncertain and may vary from expectations which could have a material impact on our results of operations and earnings per share 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain any particular worldwide effective corporate tax rate we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectations and such variance may be material additionally tax laws or their implementation and applicable tax authority practices in any particular jurisdiction could change in the future possibly on a retroactive basis and any such change could have a material adverse impact on us and our affiliates 

changes in tax treaties and trade agreements could negatively impact our costs results of operations and earnings per share 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the us which if ultimately adopted could override or otherwise adversely impact tax treaties upon which we rely or broaden the circumstances under which steris plc would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect our tax obligations we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals however if proposals were adopted that had the effect of disregarding our organization in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could be subject to increased taxation andor potentially significant expense 

existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws and regulations or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 

proposed legislation relating to the denial of us federal or state governmental contracts to us companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to redomiciled companies may adversely affect us if adopted into law we are unable to predict the likelihood that any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments or increased regulatory scrutiny could have on our business 

the us internal revenue service the “irs” may not agree that we are a foreign corporation for us federal tax purposes 

although we are organized under the laws of ireland and are a tax resident in ireland for irish tax purposes the irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and such section “section 7874” for us federal tax purposes a company generally is considered to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization because we are organized under the laws of ireland we would generally be classified as a nonus corporation and therefore a nonus tax resident under these rules section 7874 however provides an exception to this general rule under which a nonus organized entity may be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

if we were to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes we could be subject to substantial additional us tax liability additionally if we were treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes nonus holders of our ordinary shares would be subject to us withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends we paid to such shareholders for irish tax purposes we are expected regardless of any application of section 7874 to be treated as an ireland tax resident consequently if we are treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we could be liable for both us and ireland taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

business and operational risks 

our businesses are highly competitive and if we fail to compete successfully our revenues and results of operations may be hurt  

we operate in a highly competitive global environment our businesses compete with other broadline manufacturers as well as many smaller businesses specializing in particular products or services primarily on the basis of brand design quality safety ease of use serviceability price product features warranty delivery service and technical support we face increased competition from new infection prevention sterile processing contamination control surgical support cleaning consumables gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories contract sterilization and other products and services entering the market competitors and potential competitors also are attempting to develop alternate technologies and sterilizing agents as well as disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination 

consolidations among our healthcare and pharmaceutical customers may result in a loss of customers or more significant pricing pressures  

a number of our customers have consolidated these consolidations are due in part to healthcare cost reduction measures initiated by competitive pressures as well as legislators regulators and thirdparty payors this may result in greater pricing pressures on us and in some cases loss of customers additional consolidations could result in a loss of customers or more significant pricing pressures 

decreased availability or increased costs of raw materials or energy supplies or other supplies might increase our production costs or limit our production capabilities or curtail our operations 

we purchase raw materials fabricated and other components and energy supplies from a variety of suppliers key materials include stainless steel organic and inorganic chemicals fuel cobalt60 eo and plastic components the availability and prices of raw materials and energy supplies are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions speculative action world supply and demand balances inventory levels availability of substitute materials currency exchange rates anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors also certain of our key materials and components have a limited number of suppliers some are singlesourced in certain regions of the world such as cobalt60 and eo which are necessary to our ast operations changes in regulatory requirements regarding the use of the unavailability or short supply of these products might disrupt or cause shutdowns of portions of our ast operations or have other adverse consequences we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with acceleratorbased technologies which may reduce the potential supply risk shortages in supply increased regulatory or security requirements or increases in the price of raw materials components and energy supplies may adversely affe ct us in response to the active conflict between russian and ukraine we have stopped purchasing cobalt60 from our russian supplier a longterm disruption in cobalt60 sourced from russia may negatively impact gamma processing capacity or increase costs in certain portions of our ast operations but these impacts are not expected to be material to our ast segment and its results of operations 

our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks any of which could interrupt production or operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance results or value 

business continuity hazards and other risks include explosions fires earthquakes public health crises inclement weather and other disasters utility or other mechanical failures unscheduled downtime labor difficulties inability to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits disruption of communications data security preservation and redundancy disruptions inability to hire or retain key management or employees disruption of supply or distribution and regulation of the safety security or other aspects of our operations 

the occurrence of these types of events has disrupted and may in the future disrupt or shut down operations or otherwise adversely impact the production or profitability of a particular facility or our operations as a whole certain casualties also might cause personal injury and loss of life or severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and for casualties occurring at our facilities result in liability claims against us although we maintain property and casualty insurance and liability and similar insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for our industries our insurance coverages have limits and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business 

we may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the longterm effects of climate change are difficult to assess and predict the impacts may include physical risks such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions social and human effects such as population dislocations or harm to health and wellbeing compliance costs and transition risks such as regulatory or technology changes and other adverse effects the effects could impair for example the availability and cost of certain products commodities and energy including utilities which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require we bear losses incurred as a result of for example physical damage to or destruction of our facilities such as distribution or fulfillment centers loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption due to weather events that may be attributable to climate change could materially adversely affect our business operations financial position or results of operation 

our operations are subject to regulations and permitting which may be changed or amended by the relevant authorities and which may limit or eliminate our current operations or increase the complexity burden or expense of compliance and regulated materials or processes that we use in our operations may become the focus of litigation 

our ast segment is a technologyneutral contract sterilization service that offers our customers a wide range of sterilization modalities through a worldwide network of over 50 contract sterilization and laboratory facilities one of the modalities offered by our ast operations is eo sterilization in the united states several regulators including the epa fda and agencies at the state and local level play a role in regulating the use of eo sterilization in 2016 the epa changed the cancer risk basis for eo and determined that eo is carcinogenic to humans recent announcements of the temporary or permanent closure of eo sterilization facilities operated by others have been associated with state andor local regulatory or other legal action related to eo emissions at those facilities our ast operations have taken and will continue to take measures to comply with all applicable emissions regulations and to reduce emissions however no assurance can be given that current or future legislative or regulatory action or current or future litigation to which we are or may become a party will not significantly increase the costs of conducting our eo contract sterilization operations or curtail or eliminate the use of eo in our contract sterilization operations a significant reduction in our eo contract sterilization activities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further we could be liable for damages and fines as a result of legislative or regulatory action or litigation and any liability could exceed our insurance and indemnification coverage if any and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition additionally for many medical devices eo sterilization may be the only current method of sterilization that effectively sterilizes and does not damage the device during the sterilization process in the event of regulatory legislative or legal action that curtails or eliminates eo sterilization there could be a shortage of medical devices and consequently a decline in surgical procedures a decline in surgical procedures could result in a decline in demand for the products and services provided by our healthcare business which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in acquisitions and affiliations divestitures and other business arrangements our growth may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully identify price and integrate strategic business candidates or otherwise optimize our business portfolio 

our success depends in part on strategic acquisitions and joint ventures which are intended to complement or expand our businesses divestiture of nonstrategic businesses and other actions intended to optimize our portfolio of businesses this strategy depends upon our ability to identify appropriately price and complete these types of business development transactions or arrangements and to obtain any necessary financing in the last several fiscal years we have made a number of acquisitions we also completed several divestitures of nonstrategic businesses or product lines during the last several years 

our success with respect to these recent and future acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate the businesses acquired retain key personnel realize identified cost synergies and otherwise execute our strategies our success will also depend on our ability to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in joint ventures or other affiliations or to divest or realign businesses competition for strategic business candidates may result in increases in costs and price for acquisition candidates and market valuation issues may reduce the value available for divestiture of nonstrategic businesses these types of transactions are also subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties including delays in realizing or failure to realize anticipated benefits of the transactions diversion of management’s time and attention from other business concerns difficulties in retaining key employees customers or suppliers of the acquired or divested businesses difficulties in maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies or other integration or divestiture difficulties adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers other events contributing to difficulties in generating future cash flows risks associated with the assumption of contingent or other liabilities of acquisition targets or retention of liabilities for divested businesses and difficulties in obtaining financing 

if our continuing efforts to create a lean business and insource production to reduce costs are not successful our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected  

we have undertaken various activities to create a lean business including insourcing we continue to look for opportunities to insource production that is currently provided by third partiesthese activities may not produce the full efficiencies and cost reduction benefits that we expect or efficiencies and benefits might be delayed implementation costs also might exceed expectations increases in costs of doing business may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic or similar public health crises could have a material adverse impact on ability to staff our operations 

as supplier to healthcare and life sciences customers we fall within a “critical infrastructure” sector and are also considered an essential business and therefore were exempt under various stay at homeshelter in place orders associated with covid19 accordingly our employees continued to work because of the importance of our operations to the health and wellbeing of citizens in the countries in which we operate we implemented telework policies wherever possible for appropriate categories of employees however our employees that are unable to telework continued to work at our facilities and those of our customers and we implemented appropriate safety measures such as social distancing and increased cleaning protocols while we believe that we have developed appropriate measures to ensure the health and wellbeing of our employees there can be no assurances that our measures will be sufficient to protect our employees in our workplace or that they may not otherwise be exposed to covid19 or similar illness outside of our workplace if a number of our essential employees become ill incapacitated or are otherwise unable or unwilling to continue working during the current or any future health crises our operations may be adversely impacted 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified management and other personnel or other compliance matters adversely impact our personnel 

our continued success depends in large part on our ability to hire and retain highly qualified people and if we are unable to do so our business and operations may be impaired or disrupted competition for highly qualified people is intense and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining replacements to fill vacant positions successors to fill retirements or employees moving to new positions or other highly qualified personnel in addition legal regulatory or compliance matters create significant distraction or diversion of significant or unanticipated resources or attention that could have a material adverse effect on the responsibilities and retention of qualified employees 

we could experience a failure of a key information technology system process or site or a breach of information security including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers 

we rely extensively on information technology it systems to conduct business in addition we rely on networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our busines s while we have been the previous target of cyberattacks and security breaches none of these attacks or breaches to date have had a material adverse effect on the company we cannot guarantee that future cyberattacks if successful will not have a material effect on our business or financial results numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats continue to pose potential risks to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we have made investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems hiring of exp erts employee training and security policies for employees and thirdparty providers the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action in addition the covid19 pandemic may increase the risk of such vulnerability and attacks including unauthorized access or attacks exploiting the fact that a large number of employees are working remotely during government shutdowns and closures furthermore their has also been an increase in cyber incidents that appears to be associated with the ukrainerussia military conflict enforcement of the general data protection regulation “gdpr” was effective as of may 2018 the gdpr is focused on the protection of personal data not merely the privacy of personal data the gdpr creates a range of new compliance obligations and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to 4 of global annual revenues for the preceding financial year or €20 million whichever is higher for the most serious infringements 

net sales and profitability of our dental segment are highly dependent on our relationships with a limited number of large distributors 

the distribution network in the us dental industry is concentrated with relatively few distributors of consumable products accounting for a significant share of the sales volume to dentists historically the top three customers of cantels dental segment accounted for more than 400 of its revenues the loss of a significant amount of business from any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our dental segment in addition because our dental segment products are primarily sold through thirdparty distributors and not directly to end users we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors devote to our products there can be no assurance that there will not be a loss or reduction in business from one or more of our major customers in addition we cannot assure that revenues from customers that have accounted for significant revenues in the past either individually or as a group will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 

risks related to the acquisition of cantel medical 

the integration of cantel into steris may not be as successful as anticipated 

the integration involves numerous operational strategic financial accounting legal tax and other risks potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses and uncertainties related to design operation and integration of cantel’s internal control over financial reporting difficulties in integrating cantel into steris may result in cantel performing differently than expected in operational challenges or in the failure to realize anticipated expenserelated efficiencies steris’s and cantel’s existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by the actions potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include among other factors 



the acquisition of cantel may not be as accretive to steris’s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share which may negatively affect the market price of steris shares 

the acquisition may not be as accretive to steris’s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share future events and conditions could decrease or delay any expected accretion result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected including adverse changes in market conditions production levels operating results competitive conditions laws and regulations affecting steris capital expenditure obligations higher than expected integration costs lower than expected synergies and general economic conditions 

any decrease or delay of any accretion to steris’s earnings per share or cash flow from operations per share could cause the price of the steriss ordinary shares to decline 

steris has incurred and will incur significant transaction and acquisitionrelated costs in connection with the acquisition which may be in excess of those anticipated 

steris has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the acquisition of cantel and related transactions 

steris expects to continue to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with combining the operations of steris and cantel achieving desired synergies these fees and costs have been and will continue to be substantial the nonrecurring expenses include among others employee retention costs fees paid to financial legal and accounting advisors and severance and benefit costs 

steris will also incur and has incurred costs related to implementing integration plans costs to consolidate facilities and systems and employmentrelated costs additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses although steris expects that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the steris and cantel businesses should allow steris to offset integrationrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all see the risk factor titled “the integration of cantel into steris may not be as successful as anticipated” below 

the costs described above as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating results 

we incurred a substantial amount of additional debt to complete the acquisition our debt level may limit our financial and business flexibility 

we funded the cash portion of the acquisition consideration as well as the refinancing prepayment replacement redemption repurchase settlement upon conversion discharge or defeasance of certain existing indebtedness of cantel and its subsidiaries transaction expenses general corporate expenses and working capital needs through the incurrence of approximately 21 billion of new indebtedness which includes 1350 billion of senior notes issued april 1 2021 and a new delayed draw term loan agreement in the amount of 750 million we also refinanced or settled approximately 10 billion of cantels longterm indebtedness including convertible debt outstanding 

as of march 31 2022 steris had approximately 29 billion of longterm indebtedness outstanding steris’s ability to repay all the forgoing obligations will depend on among other things steris’s financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control 

our increased indebtedness could have important consequences to our shareholders including increasing steris’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate matters including dividend payments and stock repurchases limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and our industry and creating a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

our performance may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations 

our success will depend in part on our ability to manage the expansion which poses numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate the operations and business of cantel into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers vendors and business partners 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

the success of the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses including the approximately 110 million in annualized pretax cost synergies that we expect to realize within the first four fiscal years after the completion of the acquisition the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected may require more nonrecurring costs and expenditures to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee some of the assumptions that we made such as with respect to anticipated operating synergies or the costs associated with realizing such synergies significant longterm cash flow generation and the continuation of our investment grade credit profile may not be realized the integration process may result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies there could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition that were not discovered while performing due diligence 

we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material noncash changes to our results of operation in the future 

the acquisition has been accounted for as an acquisition by steris in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us which is referred to as us gaap under the acquisition method of accounting the assets and liabilities of cantel and its subsidiaries have been recorded at their respective fair values and added to those of steris our reported financial condition and results of operations for periods after completion of the acquisition reflect cantel balances and results after completion of the acquisition but have not been restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of cantel and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the acquisition 

under the acquisition method of accounting the total purchase price has been allocated to cantel’s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition the excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible becomes impaired we may be required to incur material noncash charges relating to such impairment our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment

financial measures 

in the following sections of the mda we may at times refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under us gaap we sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report backlog debttototal capital and days sales outstanding we define these financial measures as follows

• debttototal capital – we define debttototal capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity we use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth 

• days sales outstanding “dso” – we define dso as the average collection period for accounts receivable it is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters’ revenues multiplied by 365 days we use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect 

we at times may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be “nongaap financial measures” under sec rules we have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance these financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies additional information regarding these financial measures including reconciliations of each non gaap financial measure is available in the subsection of mda titled nongaap financial measures

general overview and executive summary 

steris is a leading global provider of products and services that support patient care with an emphasis on infection prevention we help our customers create a healthier and safer world by providing innovative healthcare life sciences and dental products and services we offer our customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products such as detergents gastrointestinal “gi” endoscopy accessories barrier product solutions and other products and services including equipment installation and maintenance microbial reduction of medical devices dental instruments and tools instrument and scope repair laboratory testing services outsourced reprocessing and capital equipment products such as sterilizers and surgical tables automated endoscope reprocessors and connectivity solutions such as operating room “or” integrati on 

as a result of the acquisition of cantel we have rea ssessed the organization of our business and have added a new segment called dental we now operate and report our financial information in four reportable business segments healthcare applied sterilization technologies life sciences and dental nonallocated operating costs that support the entire company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income we describe our business segments in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled business segment information 

the bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery acceptance of new technologies government policies and general economic conditions the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes mandating that manufacturers improve their processes within healthcare there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world increased demand for medical procedures including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies and a desire by our customers to operate more efficiently all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services 

acquisitions  on june 2 2021 we acquired all outstanding equity interests in cantel medical llc cantel through a us subsidiary cantel formerly headquartered in little falls new jersey with approximately 3700 employees is a global provider of infection prevention products and services primarily to endoscopy and dental customers the total consideration for cantel common stock and stock equivalents was 36 billion  

we believe that the acquisition will strengthen steris’s leadership in infection prevention by bringing together two complementary businesse s able to offer a broader set of customers a more diversified selection of infection prevention endoscopy and sterilization products and services cantel’s dental business extends our business into a new customer segment where there is an increasing focus on infection prevention protocols and processes this business is reported as the dental segment the rest of cantel was integrated into our existing healthcare and life sciences segments additionally the acquisition is expected to result in cost savings from optimizing global backoffice infrastructure leveraging bestdemonstrated practices across locations and eliminating redundant public company costs 

the results of cantel are only reflected in the results of operations and cash flows from june 2 2021 forward which will affect results of comparability to the prior period operations and cash flows 

in addition to the acquisition of cantel we completed three other tuckin acquisitions during fiscal 2022 which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the healthcare segment total aggregate consideration for these transactions was approximately 31 million net of cash acquired and including deferred consideration of 01 million 

on january 4 2021  we purchased the remaining outstanding shares of an entity in which we had initially made an equity investment in fiscal 2019 total consideration was approximately 780 million net of cash acquired and subject to any working capital adjustments total noncash consideration for this transaction was 418 million which consisted of the settlement of outstanding principal and interest on a loan receivable the initial equity investment and receivables related to capital equipment purchases that existed at the acquisition date the business has been integrated into our applied sterilization technologies business segment and we funded the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and credit facility borrowings 

on november 18 2020 we acquired all of the outstanding units and equity of key surgical llc key surgical key surgical is a global provider of sterile processing operating room and endoscopy consumable products serving hospitals and surgical facilities key surgical has been integrated into our healthcare segment the total purchase price of the acquisition was 8532 million net of cash acquired and remains subject to customary working capital adjustments 

we also completed two other tuckin acquisitions during fiscal 2021 which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the healthcare segment total aggregate consideration for these transactions was approximately 209 million net of cash acquired and including deferred consideration of approximately 12 million 

divestitures in december 2021 we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell our renal care business to evoqua water technologies corp for cash consideration of approximately 1960 million subject to certain potential adjustments including a customary working capital adjustment and contingent consideration of 123 million we recognized a gain on the sale of 10 million the transaction closed on january 3 2022 we acquired the renal care business as part of the cantel transaction which closed on june 2 2021 and had been integrated into steriss healthcare segment the renal care business generated annual revenues of approximately 1800 million the proceeds from the sale received at closing were used to repay outstanding debt 

during fiscal 2021 we sold an applied sterilization technologies laboratory that was located in the netherlands we recorded proceeds of 05 million net of cash divested and recognized a pretax loss on the sale of 20 million in the selling general and administrative expense line of the consolidated statements of income the business generated annual revenues of approximately 60 million

covid19 pandemic we do not believe that the covid19 pandemic has had a material impact on our operations as we have been able to continue to operate our manufacturing facilities and meet the demand for essential products and services of our customers in response to the covid19 pandemic we implemented several measures that we believe helped us protect the health and safety of our employees preserve liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility we have successfully managed our liquidity throughout the covid19 pandemic and continue to invest in expansion projects as planned we obtained addi tional funding in the second half o f fiscal 2021 to continue to advance our growth strategy to supplement organic growth with acquisitions as a result we do not believe that the covid19 pandemic or the actions we took in respo nse to the pandemic will negatively impact our longterm ability to generate revenues or meet existing and future financial obligations for additional information on our risk factors related to the covid19 pandemic please refer to item 1a titled risk factors 

highlights revenues increased 14775 million or 475 to 45851 million for the year ended march 31 2022 as compared to 31075 million for the year ended march 31 2021 these increases reflect added volume from cantel and other recent acquisitions organic growth in the healthcare applied sterilization technologies and life sciences segments and favorable fluctuations in currencies 

our gross profit percentage increased to 440 for fiscal 2022 as compared to 432 for fiscal 2021 favorable impact from productivity pricing and the decline in covid19 incremental costs were partially offset by unfavorable impact from our recent acquisitions material costs inflation fluctuations in currencies and mix and other adjustments 

fiscal 2022 operating income decreased 224 to 4256 million over fiscal 2021 operating income of 5484 million this decline was primarily due to additional acquisition and integration expenses and incremental amortization expense primarily related to the acquisition of cantel unplanned supply chain and inflation of approximately 450 million also contributed to the decline in fiscal 2022 

net cash flows from operations were 6848 million and free cash flow was 3990 million in fiscal 2022 compared to net cash flows from operations of 6896 million and free cash flow of 4509 million in fiscal 2021 see subsection of mda 

titled nongaap financial measures for additional information and related reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures  the fiscal 2022 decrease in free cash flow was anticipated and was primarily due to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of cantel and higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 

our debttototal capital ratio was 321 at march 31 2022 during the year we increased our quarterly dividend for the sixteenth consecutive year to 043 per share per quarter 

outlook in fiscal 2023 and beyond we expect to continue to realize incremental cost synergies as a result of the integration of cantel manage our costs grow our business with internal product and service development invest in greater capacity and augment these value creating methods with potential acquisitio ns of additional products and services we anticipate continued supply chain and inflation pressures in fiscal 2023 please refer to information with respect to our business in general in item 1business to this annual report on form 10k

each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

the following subsections describe our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions our accounting policies and recently issued accounting pronouncements are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies 

estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles we make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements these estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management’s control as a result actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates we periodically review these critical accounting policies estimates assumptions and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the customer revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services product revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer which is generally based on contract or shipping terms service revenue is recognized when the customer benefits from the service which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the customer our customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in product revenues the associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues revenues are reported net of sales and valueadded taxes collected from customers 

we have individual customer contracts that offer discounted pricing dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates we reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns rebates and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded the reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur estimated returns are recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets 

in transactions that contain multiple performance obligations such as when products maintenance services and other services are combined we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the customer we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately 

payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered generally the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant we do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year 

we do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less 

certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future at march 31 2022 assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by customers we estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors including amounts written off historically customer payment practices and general economic conditions we also analyze significant customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to pay as a result the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible these analyses require judgment if the financial condition of our customers worsens or economic conditions change we may be required to make changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 

inventories and reserves inventories are stated at the lower of their cost and net realizable value determined by the firstin firstout fifo cost method inventory costs include material labor and overhead 

we review inventory on an ongoing basis considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable if future 

market conditions vary from those projected and our estimates prove to be inaccurate we may be required to writedown inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues 

asset impairment losses property plant equipment and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value we conduct this review on an ongoing basis and if impairment exists we record the loss in the consolidated statements of income during that period 

when we evaluate assets for impairment we make certain judgments and estimates including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations historical and anticipated performance of operations and other factors if we incorrectly anticipate these factors or unexpected events occur our operating results could be materially affected 

purchase accounting and goodwill assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed these valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets we generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill but we evaluate it annually for impairment therefore the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results 

we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists we may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows managements judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

as a result of our annual impairment review for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal year 2022 no indicators of impairment were identified 

we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists we evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists 

income taxes our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in uncertain tax benefits and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities we use judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations we cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances ultimately be determined be several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published 

we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance we determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position and whether the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence we review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowance which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution individually or in the aggregate are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period 

additional information regarding income taxes is included in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled “income taxes” 

selfinsurance liabilities we record a liability for selfinsured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities workers’ compensation and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations we use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability this liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims we review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded we maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies the obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line and the other assets line of our consolidated balance sheets our accrual for selfinsured risk retention as of march 31 2022 and 2021 was 261 million and 233 million respectively 

we are also selfinsured for employee medical claims we estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience our selfinsured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date if actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods 

contingencies we are and will likely continue to be involved in a number of legal proceedings government investigations and claims which we believe generally arise in the course of our business given our size history complexity and the nature of our business products customers regulatory environment and industries in which we participate these legal proceedings investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations including without limitation personal injury eg slip and falls burns vehicle accidents product liability or regulation eg based on product operation or claimed malfunction failure to warn failure to meet specification or failure to comply with regulatory requirements product exposure eg claimed exposure to chemicals asbestos contaminants radiation property damage eg claimed damage due to leaking equipment fire vehicles chemicals commercial claims eg breach of contract economic loss warranty misrepresentation financial eg taxes reporting employment eg wrongful termination discrimination benefits matters and other claims for damage and relief 

we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable we consider many factors in making these assessments including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel we have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses in our opinion the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however the ultimate outcome of proceedings government investigations and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates we record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled commitments and contingencies for additional information 

we are subject to taxation from federal state and local and foreign jurisdictions tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates the irs of the united states routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns 

additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled commitments and contingencies 

benefit plans we provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees in addition we sponsor an unfunded postretirement benefits plan for two groups of united states retirees benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance including prescription drug coverage 

employee pension and postretirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations we believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate a summary of significant assumptions used to determine the march 31 2022 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2022 net periodic benefit costs is as follows 



na – not applicable 

we develop our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets a ssumptions by evaluating input from thirdparty professional advisors taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios and the longterm asset class return expectations generally net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases holding all other assumptions constant lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2022 benefit costs by less than 01 million 

we develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from thirdparty professional advisers taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade longterm bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations generally the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases holding all other assumptions constant lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pensi on plans and for the other postretirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2022 net periodic benefit costs by less than 01 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately 112 million a t march 31 2022 

we have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other postretirement benefit obligation the assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five yearperiod from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 70 to the assumed longterm healthcare cost trend rate a 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate including medical prescription drug and longterm rates would have had the following effect at march 31 2022 



we recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans in our balance sheets this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit plans changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur we measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled “benefit plans” contains additional information about our pension and other postretirement welfare benefits plans 

sharebased compensation we measure the estimated fair value for sharebased compensation awards including grants of employee stock options at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the sharebased compensation vests we selected the blackscholesmerton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our sharebased stock option compensation awards this model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect sharebased compensation expense 

sharebased compensation ex pense was 577 million in fiscal 2022 260 million in fiscal 2021 and 238 million in fiscal 2020 note 14 to our consolidated financial statements titled “sharebased compensation” contains additional information about our sharebased compensation plans

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations this foreign currency exchange risk arises when we conduct business in a currency other than the us dollar for most operations local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies the financial statements of subsidiaries are translated to their us dollar equivalents at endofperiod exchange rates for assets and liabilities and at average currency exchange rates for revenues and expenses translation adjustments for subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within equity note 18 to our consolidated financial statements titled “ reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss” contains additional information about the impact of translation on accumulated other comprehensive income loss and equity transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the consolidated statements of income since we operate internationally and approximately 30 of our revenues and 30 of our cost of revenues are generated outside the united states foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can significantly impact our financial position results of operations and competitive position

we operate and report our financial information in three reportable business segments healthcare applied sterilization technologies and life sciences nonallocated operating costs that support the entire company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income we disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business the accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated company 

prior to april 1 2020 we operated and reported our financial information in four reportable business segments healthcare products healthcare specialty services life sciences and applied sterilization technologies the healthcare products and healthcare specialty services segments were combined and are now reported as one segment simply called healthcare consistent with the way management now operates and views the business prior periods have been recast in the financial tables below for comparability 

the bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery acceptance of new technologies government policies and general economic conditions the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes mandating that manufacturers improve their processes within healthcare there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world increased demand for medical procedures including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies and a desire by our customers to operate more efficiently all of which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services during fiscal 2021 we experienced reduced demand for certain products and services resulting from the reduction of deferrable surgical procedures and increased demand for other products and services from our pharmaceutical customers focused on vaccines and biologics and increased demand in the applied sterilization technologies segment for personal protective equipment product services as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic began to impact our business late in fiscal 2020 the pandemic and related public health recommendations and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of covid19 including deferral of surgical procedures and treatments and shelterinplace orders or similar measures have negatively affected and are expected to continue to negatively affect some of our operations which may impact our financial position and cash flows we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable fluctuations in demand for certain of our products and services including some products and services that are experiencing increased demand to date we do not believe that the covid19 pandemic has had a material impact on our operations as we have been able to continue to operate our manufacturing facilities and meet the demand for essential products and services of our customers during fiscal 2021 in response to the to the pandemic we implemented several measures that we believe helped us protect the health and safety of our employees preserve liquidity and enhance our financial flexibilitywe allowed employees to work remotely when possible and implemented additional safety measures in compliance with applicable regulations to allow personnel to continue to work in our facilities we suspended all nonessential travel and enacted a temporary hiring freeze on certain positions to manage liquidity we suspended our stock repurchase program and deferred certain planned capital expenditures however we continued to invest in expansion projects as planned we do not believe that these actions will negatively impact our longterm ability to generate revenues or meet existing and future financial obligations 

while we have been impacted and expect this situation to continue to have an impact on our business the full impact to our results of operations an d financial position cannot be reasonably estimated at this time for additional information and our risk factors related to the covid19 pandemic please refer to part i item 1a titled risk factors 

on january 12 2021 we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire cantel medical corp nyse cmd cantel through a us subsidiary cantel is a global provider of infection prevention products and services primarily to endoscopy and dental customers for additional information please refer to item 7 titled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

information with respect to our business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials we purchase raw materials subassemblies components and other supplies needed in our operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and internationally the principal raw materials and supplies used in our operations include stainless and carbon steel organic and inorganic chemicals fuel and plastic components these raw materials and supplies are generally available from several suppliers and in sufficient quantities that we do not currently expect any significant sourcing problems in fiscal 2022 we have longterm supply contracts for certain materials for which there are few suppliers or those that are singlesourced in certain regions of the world such as eo and cobalt60 which are necessary to our ast operations in addition we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with acceleratorbased technologies which may reduce the potential supply risk 

intellectual property we protect our technology and products by among other means obtaining united states and foreign patents there can be no assurance however that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology system product service or process it covers in addition the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive we also rely upon trade secrets technical knowhow and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 

as of march 31 2021 we held approximately 450 united states patents and approximately 1780 in other jurisdictions and had approximately 140 united states patent applications and 335 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained the actual protection a patent provides varies from country to country and depends in part upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in each country 

our products are sold around the world under various brand names and trademarks we consider our brand names and trademarks to be valuable in the marketing of our products as of march 31 2021 we had a total of approximately 1670 trademark registrations worldwide 

quality assurance we manufacture assemble and package products in several countries each of our production facilities are dedicated to particular processes and products our success depends upon customer confidence in the quality of our production process and the integrity of the data that supports our product safety and effectiveness we have implemented quality assurance procedures to support the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes 

government regulation our business is subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate in the united states the united states food and drug administration “fda” the united states environmental protection agency “epa” the united states nuclear regulatory commission “nrc” and other governmental authorities regulate the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products and services our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation including countryspecific rules and regulations and us regulations applicable to our international operations government regulations include detailed inspection of and controls over research and development clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing marketing and promotion sampling distribution recordkeeping storage and disposal practices 

compliance with applicable regulations is a significant expense for us past current or future regulations their interpretation or their application could have a material adverse impact on our operations also additional governmental regulation may be passed that could prevent delay revoke or result in the rejection of regulatory clearance of our products we cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulation or the interpretation or application of these regulations 

if we fail to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements sanctions could be imposed on us for more information about the risks we face regarding regulatory requirements see part i item 1a of this annual report titled risk factors we are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations failure to receive or maintain or delays in receiving clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues profitability financial condition or value 

in the past we have received warning letters paid civil penalties conducted product recalls and field corrections and been subject to other regulatory sanctions we believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements however there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory governmental or private action will not have a material adverse affect on us or on our performance results or financial condition 

environmental matters we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in ireland the united states and other countries we have made and continue to make significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations we cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations we believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental health and safety requirements in all material respects however there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory governmental or private action will not have a material adverse affect on our performance results or financial condition please refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled commitments and contingencies for further information 

in the future if a loss contingency related to environmental matters employee safety health or conditional asset retirement obligations is significantly greater than the current estimated amount we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded the investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition liquidity or cash flow nor can there be any assurance that such liabilities would not have a material adverse affect on our performance results or financial condition 

competition the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and generally highly regulated competition is intense in all of our business segments and includes many large and small competitors brand design quality safety ease of use serviceability price product features warranty delivery service and technical support are important competitive factors to us we expect to face continued competition in the future as new infection prevention sterile processing contamination control gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market we believe many organizations are working with a variety of technologies and sterilizing agents also a number of companies have developed disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination 

we believe that our longterm competitive position depends on our success in discovering developing and marketing innovative costeffective products and services we devote significant resources to research and development efforts and we believe steris is positioned as a global competitor in the search for technological innovations in addition to research and development we invest in quality control customer programs distribution systems technical services and other information services 

there can be no assurance that we will develop significant new products or services or that the new products or services we provide or develop in the future will be more commercially successful than those provided or developed by our competitors in addition some of our existing or potential competitors may have greater resources than us therefore a competitor may succeed in developing and commercializing products more rapidly than we do competition as it relates to our business segments and product categories is discussed in more detail in the section above titled “information related to business segments”

health safety  environment 

we realize the importance of health safety  environment hse to the wellbeing of our customers employees community the environment and ultimately our shareholders to that end our hse teams and management are committed to supporting hse programs with ongoing involvement through our continuous improvement process our ultimate goal is to be an incidentfree company the cornerstone of this initiative is the belief that incidents result from unsafe acts or conditions both of which are preventable we apply the us occupational safety and health administration recordkeeping practices worldwide key metrics for purposes of benchmarking performance include total recordable cases trc and days away from work dafw injury and illness incident rates both of which are presented in the table below

we believe that engaged employees are more productive innovative and satisfied in their work examples of how we engage our employees include quarterly management meetings a robust intranet for communication with our global teams and various communications efforts within each department in addition our global human resources team has programs focused on career development for employees at all levels 

our employee turnover rate was 11 and 15 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively and we are continuously working towards a goal of achieving 10 or under excluding retirements and reductions in force although reductions in force are sometimes necessary we work to avoid them and they must always be approved by executive management every year we 

encourage all associates to participate in our employee engagement survey which is administered by a third party on a confidential basis this process has been valuable in helping us recognize things we do well and foster an open conversation about how we can make steris an even better place to work we are pleased to report that 89 and 86 of our people completed our 2021 and 2020 surveys respectively in our most recent survey overall employee engagement was 77 and the fourteen principal factors that we measure all improved since 2020 and have generally for a decade the results indicate that the majority of our people are committed to serving our customers are proud to work for steris and have confidence in the stability of our business

• implemented additional cleaning protocols in all facilities limited travel and discontinued in person meetings where practical 

• provided additional personal protective equipment for fieldbased personnel supporting critical care environments

 item 1a risk factors 

this section describes certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations you should consider these risk factors when evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because our actual results and financial condition might differ materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements should these risks occur we face other risks besides those highlighted below these other risks include additional uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial but may ultimately have a significant impact in addition the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate any of these risks which could have a material effect on us should any of these risks described below or otherwise actually occur our business financial condition performance prospects value or results of operations could be negatively affected 

legal regulatory and tax risks 

market risks 

doing business internationally 

compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting international laws and regulations import and export limitations anticorruption laws and exchange controls may be difficult burdensome or expensive 

we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we are also subject to limitations on trade with persons in sanctioned countries while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws we cannot assure you that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic along with the response to the pandemic by governmental and other actors has disrupted our operations we have experienced temporary mandatory and voluntary facility closures in certain jurisdictions in which we operate furthermore we have experienced less demand for certain of our products and services as a result of deferrals of certain medical procedures and other factors which we believe was exacerbated by the impact of stayathome orders additionally the covid19 outbreak has caused temporary disruptions in our supply chain 

longterm facility closures or other restrictions could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff supply or otherwise maintain our operations such restrictions also may have a substantial impact on our customers and our sales cycles the covid19 pandemic may put pressure on overall spending for our products and services and may cause our customers to modify spending priorities or delay or abandon purchasing decisions moreover because a large number of our employees have been working from home we may be subject to increased vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks we have modified and may further modify our business practices in response to the risks and negative impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic however there can be no assurance that these measures will be temporary or successful 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate duration severity and disruption to our business customers and supply chain and the related financial impact to us cannot be accurately forecasted at this time should such disruption continue for an extended period the adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition could be more severe additionally weak economic conditions the pace for economic recovery and raising inflation could result in extended weak demand for our products and services furthermore future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks discussed above 

changes in economic climate may adversely affect us 

adverse economic cycles or conditions and customer regulatory or government response to those cycles or conditions have affected and could further affect our results of operations the onset of these cycles or conditions may not be foreseeable and there can be no assurance when they will begin to improve after they occur there also can be no assurance as to the strength or length of any recovery from a business downturn or recession credit and liquidity problems may make it difficult for some businesses to access credit markets and obtain financing and may cause some businesses to curtail spending to conserve cash in anticipation of persistent business slowdowns and liquidity needs if our customers have difficulty financing their purchases due to tight credit markets or related factors or because of other operational or utilization problems they may be experiencing or otherwise decide to curtail their purchases our business could be adversely affected our exposure to bad debt losses could also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered and delivered 

many of our customers are governmental entities or other entities that rely on government healthcare systems or government funding if government funding for healthcare becomes limited or restricted in countries in which we operate including as a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic our customers may be unable to pay their obligations on a timely basis or to make payment in full and it may become necessary to increase reserves in addition there can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in collection difficulties prospectively additional adverse effects resulting from these conditions may include decreased healthcare utilization further pricing pressure on our products and services andor weaker overall demand for our products and services particularly capital products 

our acquisition activity and ability to grow organically may be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to access the financial markets  

our recent acquisitions have been financed largely through cash on hand and borrowings under our bank credit facilities and through public note offerings in early april of fiscal 2022 future acquisitions including the pending acquisition of cantel medical corp cantel or other capital requirements will necessitate additional cash to the extent our existing sources of cash are insufficient to fund these or other future activities we have and may need to raise additional funds through new or expanded borrowing arrangements or equity there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds beyond those available under existing bank credit facilities on terms favorable to us or at all or that such facilities can be replaced when they terminate 

healthcare laws and reimbursement 

changes in healthcare laws or government and other thirdparty payor reimbursement levels to healthcare providers or failure to meet healthcare reimbursement or other requirements might negatively impact our business 

we sell many of our products and services to hospitals and other healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers many of these customers are subject to or supported by government programs or receive reimbursement for services from thirdparty payors such as government programs including medicare and medicaid in the us private insurance plans and managed care programs reimbursement systems vary significantly by country governmentmanaged healthcare systems control reimbursement for healthcare services in many countries public budgetary constraints may significantly impact the ability of hospitals pharmaceutical manufacturers and other customers supported by such systems to purchase our products government or other thirdparty payors may deny or change coverage reduce their current levels of reimbursement for healthcare services or otherwise implement measures to regulate pricing or contain costs in addition our costs may increase more rapidly than reimbursement levels or permissible pricing increases or we may not satisfy the standards or requirements for reimbursement 

among other provisions the us patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act imposed an excise tax on medical devices manufactured or offered for sale in the united states late in 2019 us congress enacted legislation that repealed the excise tax which had been suspended during calendar years 2016 through 2019 in addition we have been required to commit significant resources to “sunshine act” compliance various additional health care reform proposals have emerged at the federal and state level and we are unable to predict which if any of those proposals will be enacted 

product and service related regulations and claims 

we are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations failure to receive or maintain or delays in receiving clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues profitability financial condition or value 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation in the countries where we do business in the united states our products and services are regulated by the fda and other regulatory authorities in many foreign countries sales of our products and services are subject to extensive regulations that may or may not be comparable to those of the fda in europe our products are regulated primarily by country and community regulations of those countries within the european economic area and must conform to the requirements of those authorities 

government regulation applies to nearly all aspects of testing manufacturing safety labeling storing recordkeeping reporting promoting distributing and importing or exporting of medical devices products and services in general unless an exemption applies a sterilization decontamination or medical device or product or service must receive regulatory approval or clearance before it can be marketed or sold modifications to existing products or the marketing of new uses for existing products also may require regulatory approvals approval supplements or clearances if we are unable to obtain any required approvals approval supplements or clearances for any modification to a previously cleared or approved device we may be required to cease manufacturing and sale or recall or restrict the use of such modified device pay fines or take other action until such time as appropriate clearance or approval is obtained 

regulatory agencies may refuse to grant approval or clearance or review and disagree with our interpretation of approvals or clearances or with our decision that regulatory approval is not required or has been maintained regulatory submissions may require the provision of additional data and may be time consuming and costly and their outcome is uncertain regulatory agencies may also change policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay approval or clearance of devices or could impact our ability to market a previously cleared approved or unregulated device our failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda or other applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or elsewhere might subject us to administratively or judicially imposed sanctions these sanctions include among others warning letters fines civil penalties criminal penalties injunctions debarment product seizure or detention product recalls and total or partial suspension of production sale andor promotion 

the covid19 pandemic may disrupt the operations of regulatory bodies with responsibility for oversight of healthcare and health and medical products such disruptions could result in the focus and prioritization of regulatory resources on emergent matters which could divert regulatory resources away from more routine regulatory matters that are not covid19 related but that have the potential to impact our business for example there could be delays in fda review of applications for marketing authorization including those which may be necessary for or in connection with proposed changes to our products or the changes to the processes by which they are manufactured it is unknown how long these disruptions could continue were they to occur any elongation or deprioritization or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect our ongoing device design development and commercialization plans 

our products are subject to recalls and restrictions even after receiving united states or foreign regulatory clearance or approval 

ongoing medical device reporting regulations require that we report to appropriate governmental authorities in the united states andor other countries when our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur governmental authorities can require product recalls or impose restrictions for product design manufacturing labeling clearance or other issues for the same reasons we may voluntarily elect to recall or restrict the use of a product any recall or restriction could divert managerial and financial resources and might harm our reputation among our customers and other healthcare professionals who use or recommend our products and services 

we may be adversely affected by product liability claims or other legal actions or regulatory or compliance matters  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions a significant increase in the number severity amount or scope of these claims and actions may as described above with respect to recalls and restrictions result in substantial costs and harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect product sales and our business product liability claims and other legal and regulatory actions may also distract management from other business responsibilities 

we are also subject to a variety of other types of claims proceedings investigations and litigation initiated by government agencies or third parties and other potential risks and liabilities these include compliance matters product regulation or safety taxes employee benefit plans employment discrimination health and safety environmental antitrust customs importexport government contract compliance financial controls or reporting intellectual property allegations of misrepresentation false claims or false statements commercial claims claims regarding promotion of our products and services or other similar or different matters any such claims proceedings investigations or litigation regardless of the merits might result in substantial costs restrictions on product use or sales or otherwise injure our business 

administratively or judicially imposed or agreed sanctions might include warning letters fines civil penalties criminal penalties loss of tax benefits injunctions product seizure recalls suspensions or restrictions relabeling detention andor debarment we also might be required to take actions such as payment of substantial amounts or revision of financial statements or to take or be subject to the following types of actions with respect to our products services or business redesign relabel restrict or recall products cease manufacturing and selling products seizure of product inventory comply with a court injunction restricting or prohibiting further marketing and sale of products or services comply with a consent decree which could result in further regulatory constraints dedication of significant internal and external resources and costs to respond to and comply with legal and regulatory issues and constraints respond to claims litigation and other proceedings brought by customers users governmental agencies and others disruption of product improvements and product launches discontinuation of certain product lines or services or other restrictions or limitations on product sales use or operation or other activities or business practices 

some product replacements or substitutions may not be possible or may be prohibitively costly or time consuming the impact of any legal regulatory or compliance claims proceeding investigation or litigation is difficult to predict 

we maintain product liability and other insurance with coverages believed to be adequate however product liability or other claims may exceed insurance coverage limits fines penalties and regulatory sanctions may not be covered by insurance or insurance may not continue to be available or available on commercially reasonable terms additionally our insurers might deny claim coverage for valid or other reasons or may become insolvent 

our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by difficulties in acquiring or maintaining a proprietary intellectual ownership position 

to maintain our competitive position for our products we need to obtain patent or other proprietary rights for new and improved products and to maintain and enforce our existing patents and other proprietary rights we typically apply for patents in the united states and in strategic other countries we may also acquire patents through acquisitions we may encounter difficulties in obtaining or protecting patents 

we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology these measures afford only limited protection and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information litigation may be necessary to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights litigation may also be brought against us claiming that we have violated the intellectual property rights of others litigation may be costly and may divert management’s attention from other matters additionally in some foreign countries with weaker intellectual property rights it may be difficult to maintain and enforce patents and other proprietary rights or defend against claims of infringement 

tax and trade risk 

we might be adversely impacted by tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions 

we are subject to the tax laws at the federal state or provincial and local government levels in the many jurisdictions in which we operate or sell products or services tax laws might change in ways that adversely affect our tax positions effective tax rate and cash flow the tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we are subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions that might assess additional tax liabilities against us our tax reporting positions might be challenged by relevant tax authorities we might incur significant expense in our efforts to defend those challenges and we might be unsuccessful in those efforts developments in examinations and challenges might materially change our provision for taxes in the affected periods and might differ materially from our historical tax accruals any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations our cash flows and our financial position or results of operations 

current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction subject to significant change 

the us tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” was signed into law on december 22 2017 guidance continues to be issued clarifying the application of this new legislation and new changes have been proposed in the us that could increase our total tax expense we cannot predict the overall impact that the additional guidance and proposed changes may have on our business some jurisdictions have raised tax rates and it is reasonable to expect that other global taxing authorities will be reviewing current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the tcja current economic conditions and covid19 response costs 

in addition further changes in the tax laws of other jurisdictions could arise including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting b eps project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries has issued recommendations that in some cases would make substantial changes to numerous longstanding tax positions and principles these contemplated changes to the extent adopted by oecd members andor other countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

our tax rate is uncertain and may vary from expectations which could have a material impact on our results of operations and earnings per share 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain any particular worldwide effective corporate tax rate we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectations and such variance may be material additionally tax laws or their implementation and applicable tax authority practices in any particular jurisdiction could change in the future possibly on a retroactive basis and any such change could have a material adverse impact on us and our affiliates 

changes in tax treaties and trade agreements could negatively impact our costs results of operations and earnings per share 

legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the us which if ultimately adopted could override or otherwise adversely impact tax treaties upon which we rely or broaden the circumstances under which steris plc would be considered a us resident each of which could materially and adversely affect our tax obligations we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals however if proposals were adopted that had the effect of disregarding our organization in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the us we could be subject to increased taxation andor potentially significant expense 

existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws and regulations or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 

proposed legislation relating to the denial of us federal or state governmental contracts to us companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business 

various us federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to redomiciled companies may adversely affect us if adopted into law we are unable to predict the likelihood that any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments or the effect such enactments or increased regulatory scrutiny could have on our business 

the us internal revenue service the “irs” may not agree that we are a foreign corporation for us federal tax purposes 

although we are organized under the laws of ireland and are a tax resident in ireland for irish tax purposes the irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and such section “section 7874” for us federal tax purposes a company generally is considered to be a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization because we are organized under the laws of ireland we would generally be classified as a nonus corporation and therefore a nonus tax resident under these rules section 7874 however provides an exception to this general rule under which a nonus organized entity may be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes 

if we were to be treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes we could be subject to substantial additional us tax liability additionally if we were treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes nonus holders of our ordinary shares would be subject to us withholding tax on the gross amount of any dividends we paid to such shareholders for irish tax purposes we are expected regardless of any application of section 7874 to be treated as an ireland tax resident consequently if we are treated as a us corporation for us federal tax purposes under section 7874 we could be liable for both us and ireland taxes which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

business and operational risks 

competition 

our businesses are highly competitive and if we fail to compete successfully our revenues and results of operations may be hurt  

we operate in a highly competitive global environment our businesses compete with other broadline manufacturers as well as many smaller businesses specializing in particular products or services primarily on the basis of brand design quality safety ease of use serviceability price product features warranty delivery service and technical support we face increased competition from new infection prevention sterile processing contamination control surgical support cleaning consumables gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories contract sterilization and other products and services entering the market competitors and potential competitors also are attempting to develop alternate technologies and sterilizing agents as well as disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination 

consolidations among our healthcare and pharmaceutical customers may result in a loss of customers or more significant pricing pressures  

a number of our customers have consolidated these consolidations are due in part to healthcare cost reduction measures initiated by competitive pressures as well as legislators regulators and thirdparty payors this may result in greater pricing pressures on us and in some cases loss of customers additional consolidations could result in a loss of customers or more significant pricing pressures 

decreased availability or increased costs of raw materials or energy supplies or other supplies might increase our production costs or limit our production capabilities or curtail our operations 

we purchase raw materials fabricated and other components and energy supplies from a variety of suppliers key materials include stainless steel organic and inorganic chemicals fuel cobalt60 eo and plastic components the availability and prices of raw materials and energy supplies are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions speculative action world supply and demand balances inventory levels availability of substitute materials currency exchange rates anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors also certain of our key materials and components have a limited number of suppliers some are singlesourced in certain regions of the world such as cobalt60 and eo which are necessary to our ast operations changes in regulatory requirements regarding the use of the unavailability or short supply of these products might disrupt or cause shutdowns of portions of our ast operations or have other adverse consequences we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with acceleratorbased technologies which may reduce the potential supply risk shortages in supply increased regulatory or security requirements or increases in the price of raw materials components and energy supplies may adversely affect us 

our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks any of which could interrupt production or operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance results or value 

business continuity hazards and other risks include explosions fires earthquakes public health crises inclement weather and other disasters utility or other mechanical failures unscheduled downtime labor difficulties inability to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits disruption of communications data security preservation and redundancy disruptions inability to hire or retain key management or employees disruption of supply or distribution and regulation of the safety security or other aspects of our operations 

the occurrence of these types of events has disrupted and may in the future disrupt or shut down operations or otherwise adversely impact the production or profitability of a particular facility or our operations as a whole certain casualties also might cause personal injury and loss of life or severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and for casualties occurring at our facilities result in liability claims against us although we maintain property and casualty insurance and liability and similar insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for our industries our insurance coverages have limits and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business 

we may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the longterm effects of climate change are difficult to assess and predict the impacts may include physical risks such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions social and human effects such as population dislocations or harm to health and wellbeing compliance costs and transition risks such as regulatory or technology changes and other adverse effects the effects could impair for example the availability and cost of certain products commodities and energy including utilities which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require we bear losses incurred as a result of for example physical damage to or destruction of our facilities such as distribution or fulfillment centers loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption due to weather events that may be attributable to climate change could materially adversely affect our business operations financial position or results of operation 

our operations are subject to regulations and permitting which may be changed or amended by the relevant authorities and which may limit or eliminate our current operations or increase the complexity burden or expense of compliance and regulated materials or processes that we use in our operations may become the focus of litigation 

our applied sterilization technologies “ast” segment is a technologyneutral contract sterilization service that offers our customers a wide range of sterilization modalities through a worldwide network of over 50 contract sterilization and laboratory facilities one of the modalities offered by our ast operations is ethylene oxide “eo” sterilization in the united states several regulators including the us environmental protection agency “epa” us food and drug administration “fda” and agencies at the state and local level play a role in regulating the use of eo sterilization in 2016 the epa changed the cancer risk basis for eo and determined that eo is carcinogenic to humans recent announcements of the temporary or permanent closure of eo sterilization facilities operated by others have been associated with state andor local regulatory or other legal action related to eo emissions at those facilities our ast operations have taken and will continue to take measures to comply with all applicable emissions regulations and to reduce emissions however no assurance can be given that current or future legislative or regulatory action or current or future litigation to which we are or may become a party will not significantly increase the costs of conducting our eo contract sterilization operations or curtail or eliminate the use of eo in our contract sterilization operations a significant reduction in our eo contract sterilization activities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further we could be liable for damages and fines as a result of legislative or regulatory action or litigation and any liability could exceed our insurance and indemnification coverage if any and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition additionally for many medical devices eo sterilization may be the only current method of sterilization that effectively sterilizes and does not damage the device during the sterilization process in the event of regulatory legislative or legal action that curtails or eliminates eo sterilization there could be a shortage of medical devices and consequently a decline in surgical procedures a decline in surgical procedures could result in a decline in demand for the products and services provided by our healthcare business which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in acquisitions and affiliations divestitures and other business arrangements our growth may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully identify price and integrate strategic business candidates or otherwise optimize our business portfolio 

our success depends in part on strategic acquisitions and joint ventures which are intended to complement or expand our businesses divestiture of nonstrategic businesses and other actions intended to optimize our portfolio of businesses this strategy depends upon our ability to identify appropriately price and complete these types of business development transactions or arrangements and to obtain any necessary financing in the last several fiscal years we have made a number of acquisitions we also completed several divestitures of nonstrategic businesses or product lines during the last several years 

our success with respect to these recent and future acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate the businesses acquired retain key personnel realize identified cost synergies and otherwise execute our strategies our success will also depend on our ability to develop satisfactory working arrangements with our strategic partners in joint ventures or other affiliations or to divest or realign businesses competition for strategic business candidates may result in increases in costs and price for acquisition candidates and market valuation issues may reduce the value available for divestiture of nonstrategic businesses these types of transactions are also subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties including delays in realizing or failure to realize anticipated benefits of the transactions diversion of management’s time and attention from other business concerns difficulties in retaining key employees customers or suppliers of the acquired or divested businesses difficulties in maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies or other integration or divestiture difficulties adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers other events contributing to difficulties in generating future cash flows risks associated with the assumption of contingent or other liabilities of acquisition targets or retention of liabilities for divested businesses and difficulties in obtaining financing 

if our continuing efforts to create a lean business and insource production to reduce costs are not successful our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected  

we have undertaken various activities to create a lean business including insourcing we continue to look for opportunities to insource production that is currently provided by third partiesthese activities may not produce the full efficiencies and cost reduction benefits that we expect or efficiencies and benefits might be delayed implementation costs also might exceed expectations 

the covid19 pandemic or similar public health crises could have a material adverse impact on ability to staff our operations 

as supplier to healthcare and life sciences customers we fall within a “critical infrastructure” sector and are also considered an essential business and therefore exempt under various stay at homeshelter in place orders accordingly our employees continue to work because of the importance of our operations to the health and wellbeing of citizens in the countries in which we operate we have implemented telework policies wherever possible for appropriate categories of employees however our employees that are unable to telework continue to work at our facilities and those of our customers and we have implemented appropriate safety measures such as social distancing and increased cleaning protocols while we believe that we have taken appropriate measures to ensure the health and wellbeing of our employees there can be no assurances that our measures will be sufficient to protect our employees in our workplace or that they may not otherwise be exposed to covid19 outside of our workplace if a number of our essential employees become ill incapacitated or are otherwise unable or unwilling to continue working during the current or any future health crises our operations may be adversely impacted 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified management and other personnel or other compliance matters adversely impact our personnel 

our continued success depends in large part on our ability to hire and retain highly qualified people and if we are unable to do so our business and operations may be impaired or disrupted competition for highly qualified people is intense and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining replacements to fill vacant positions successors to fill retirements or employees moving to new positions or other highly qualified personnel in addition legal regulatory or compliance matters create significant distraction or diversion of significant or unanticipated resources or attention that could have a material adverse effect on the responsibilities and retention of qualified employees 

we could experience a failure of a key information technology system process or site or a breach of information security including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems networks processes associated sites or service providers 

we rely extensively on information technology it systems to conduct business in addition we rely on networks and services including internet sites data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware software and technical applications and platforms some of which are managed hosted provided andor used by thirdparties or their vendors to assist in conducting our business numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our it systems networks and services as well as the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we have made investments seeking to address these threats including monitoring of networks and systems hiring of experts employee training and security policies for employees and thirdparty providers the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or we or one of our thirdparty providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis we may be exposed to reputational competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action in addition the covid19 pandemic may increase the risk of such vulnerability and attacks including unauthorized access or attacks exploiting the fact that a large number of employees are working remotely during government shutdowns and closures enforcement of the general data protection regulation “gdpr” was effective as of may 2018 the gdpr is focused on the protection of personal data not merely the privacy of personal data the gdpr creates a range of new compliance obligations and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance including possible fines of up to 4 of global annual revenues for the preceding financial year or €20 million whichever is higher for the most serious infringements 

risks related to the pending acquisition of cantel medical corp 

the market price of steris shares may continue to fluctuate after the mergers 

upon completion of the mergers holders of cantel common stock will become holders of steris shares the market price of steris shares may fluctuate significantly following completion of the mergers and holders could lose some or all of the value of their investment in steris shares in addition the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent times which if they continue to occur could have a material adverse effect on the market for or liquidity of the steris shares regardless of steris’s actual operating performance 

failure to complete the mergers or delays could negatively impact the price of steris shares as well as steris’s respective future business and financial results 

the anticipated completion date of the mergers is june 2 2021 however the merger agreement contains conditions that remain to be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the mergers there can be no assurance that the remaining conditions to the mergers will be so satisfied or waived if the conditions to the mergers are not satisfied or waived steris and cantel will be unable to complete the mergers and the merger agreement may be terminated furthermore the delay in the fulfillment of such conditions could result in unanticipated expenditures of funds and other resources andor reduce the benefits of the acquisition of cantel even if ultimately consummated 

the mergers may not be accretive and may be dilutive to steris’s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share which may negatively affect the market price of steris shares 

the mergers may not be accretive and may be dilutive to steris’s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share future events and conditions could decrease or delay any expected accretion result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected including adverse changes in market conditions production levels operating results competitive conditions laws and regulations affecting steris capital expenditure obligations higher than expected integration costs lower than expected synergies and general economic conditions 

any dilution of or decrease or delay of any accretion to steris’s earnings per share or cash flow from operations per share could cause the price of the steris shares to decline 

steris will incur significant transaction and mergerrelated costs in connection with the mergers which may be in excess of those anticipated 

steris has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement 

steris expects to continue to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with completing the mergers and combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies these fees and costs have been and will continue to be substantial most of the nonrecurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the mergers and include among others employee retention costs fees paid to financial legal and accounting advisors fees paid to banks and other financial institutions in conjunction with obtaining financing and other related costs severance and benefit costs and filing fees 

steris will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans costs to consolidate facilities and systems and employmentrelated costs steris will continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the mergers and the integration of the two companies’ businesses although steris expects that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow steris to offset integrationrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all see the risk factor entitled “the integration of cantel into steris may not be as successful as anticipated” below 

the costs described above as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating results of steris following the completion of the mergers 

many of these costs will be borne by steris even if the mergers are not completed 

lawsuits have been filed against cantel steris and the members of the cantel board of directors challenging the adequacy of the disclosures made in the proxy statementprospectus and an adverse ruling in one or more of these lawsuits may prevent the mergers from being completed 

lawsuits arising out of the mergers have been filed and may be filed in the future there can be no assurance that any of the defendants will be successful in the outcome of any potential future lawsuits a preliminary injunction could delay or jeopardize the completion of the mergers and an adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin the completion of the mergers 

completion of the mergers will trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which cantel is a party  

completion of the mergers will trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which cantel is a party to the extent steris and cantel are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages even if steris and cantel are able to negotiate waivers the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to cantel 

we will incur a substantial amount of additional debt to complete the mergers our debt after completion of the mergers may limit our financial and business flexibility 

we intend to fund the cash consideration of the merger consideration as well as the refinancing prepayment replacement redemption repurchase settlement upon conversion discharge or defeasance of certain existing indebtedness of cantel and its subsidiaries transaction expenses general corporate expenses and working capital needs through the incurrence of approximately 21 billion of new indebtedness which includes 1350 billion of senior notes issued april 1 2021 and a new delayed draw term loan agreement in the amount of 750 million to be borrowed upon completion of the mergers as of january 31 2021 cantel had approximately 10 billio n of longterm indebtedness including convertible debt outstanding 

as of march 31 2021 steris had approximate ly 17 billion of lon gterm indebtedness outstanding steris’s ability to repay all the forgoing obligations will depend on among other things steris’s financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control 

our increased indebtedness after completion of the mergers could have important consequences to shareholders of steris shares including cantel stockholders who receive steris shares as a result of the mergers including increasing steris’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness thereby reducing its ability to use its cash flow to fund working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate requirements including dividend payments and stock repurchases limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and its industry and creating a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

the integration of cantel into steris may not be as successful as anticipated 

the mergers involve numerous operational strategic financial accounting legal tax and other risks potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses and uncertainties related to design operation and integration of cantel’s internal control over financial reporting difficulties in integrating cantel into steris may result in cantel performing differently than expected in operational challenges or in the failure to realize anticipated expenserelated efficiencies steris’s and cantel’s existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by the mergers potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include among other factors 



our performance may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the mergers 

following completion of the mergers our success will depend in part on our ability to manage the expansion which poses numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate the operations and business of cantel into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers vendors and business partners 

even if steris and cantel complete the mergers we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed mergers or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

the success of the mergers will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses including the approximately 110 million in annualized pretax cost synergies that we expect to realize within the first four fiscal years after the completion of the mergers the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the mergers may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected may require more nonrecurring costs and expenditures to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee some of the assumptions that we made such as with respect to anticipated operating synergies or the costs associated with realizing such synergies significant longterm cash flow generation and the continuation of our investment grade credit profile may not be realized the integration process may result in the loss of key employees the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies there could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the mergers that were not discovered while performing due diligence 

uncertainties associated with the mergers may cause a loss of management personnel and other employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of steris 

steris and cantel are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other employees to execute their business plans each company’s success until the mergers and our success after the mergers will depend in part upon our ability to retain management personnel and other employees current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the mergers which may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract or retain management and other personnel accordingly no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain management personnel and other employees that we would have previously been able to attract or retain 

the market price of steris shares may decline in the future as a result of the sale of the steris shares held by former cantel stockholders or current steris shareholders 

based on the number of shares of cantel common stock outstanding as of february 28 2021 we expect to issue ap proximately 14300000 steris s hares to cantel stockholders in the mergers following their receipt of steris shares as stock consideration in the mergers former cantel stockholders may seek to sell steris shares delivered to them other steris shareholders may also seek to sell steris shares held by them these sales or the perception that these sales may occur coupled with the increase in the outstanding number of steris shares may affect the market for and the market price of steris shares in an adverse manner 

after completion of the mergers we will record goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material noncash changes to our results of operation in the future 

the mergers will be accounted for as an acquisition by steris in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us which is referred to as gaap under the acquisition method of accounting the assets and liabilities of cantel and its subsidiaries will be recorded as of completion at their respective fair values and added to those of steris our reported financial condition and results of operations for periods after completion of the mergers will reflect cantel balances and results after completion of the mergers but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of cantel and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the mergers 

under the acquisition method of accounting the total purchase price will be allocated to cantel’s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the mergers the excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible becomes impaired we may be required to incur material noncash charges relating to such impairment our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment

financial measures 

in the following sections of the mda we may at times refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under us gaap we sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report backlog debttototal capital and days sales outstanding we define these financial measures as follows 

• backlog – we define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time we use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of shortterm financial results and inventory requirements 

• debttototal capital – we define debttototal capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity we use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth 

• days sales outstanding “dso” – we define dso as the average collection period for accounts receivable it is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters’ revenues multiplied by 365 days we use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect 

we at times may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be “nongaap financial measures” under sec rules we have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance these financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies additional information regarding these financial measures including reconciliations of each non gaap financial measure is available in the subsection of mda titled nongaap financial measures

fiscal 2021 operating income increased 21 to 5484 million over fiscal 2020 operating income of 5370 million this increase was primarily attributable to higher gross margin attainment additional expenses from our recent acquisitions were partially offset by reduced selling general and administrative “sga” expenses during fiscal 2021 as certain expenses were suspended or decreased as a result of the covid19 pandemic

critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions 

the following subsections describe our most critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled “nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies” 

estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles we make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements these estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management’s control as a result actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates we periodically review these critical accounting policies estimates assumptions and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the customer revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services product revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer which is generally based on contract or shipping terms service revenue is recognized when the customer benefits from the service which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the customer our customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in product revenues the associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues revenues are reported net of sales and valueadded taxes collected from customers 

we have individual customer contracts that offer discounted pricing dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates we reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns rebates and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded the reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur estimated returns are recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets 

in transactions that contain multiple performance obligations such as when products maintenance services and other services are combined we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the customer we allocate 

the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately 

payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered generally the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant we do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year 

we do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less 

certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future at march 31 2021 assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by customers we estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors including amounts written off historically customer payment practices and general economic conditions we also analyze significant customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to pay as a result the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible these analyses require judgment if the financial condition of our customers worsens or economic conditions change we may be required to make changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 

allowance for sales returns we maintain an allowance for sales returns based upon known returns and estimated returns for both capital equipment and consumables we estimate returns of capital equipment and consumables based upon historical experience 

inventories and reserves inventories are stated at the lower of their cost and net realizable value determined by the firstin firstout “fifo” cost method inventory costs include material labor and overhead 

we review inventory on an ongoing basis considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable if future market conditions vary from those projected and our estimates prove to be inaccurate we may be required to writedown inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues 

asset impairment losses property plant equipment and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value we conduct this review on an ongoing basis and if impairment exists we record the loss in the consolidated statements of income during that period 

when we evaluate assets for impairment we make certain judgments and estimates including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations historical and anticipated performance of operations and other factors if we incorrectly anticipate these factors or unexpected events occur our operating results could be materially affected 

asset retirement obligations we incur retirement obligations for certain assets we record an initial liability for the asset retirement obligations aro at fair value accounting for the aro at inception and in subsequent periods includes the determination of the present value of a liability and offsetting asset the subsequent accretion of that liability and depletion of the asset and a periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates used in the analysis we provide additional information about our asset retirement obligations in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements titled “property plant and equipment” 

restructuring we record specific accruals in connection with plans for restructuring elements of our business these accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs the closure andor consolidation of facilities and contractual obligations actual amounts could differ from the original estimates we review our restructuringrelated accruals on a quarterly basis and changes to plans are appropriately recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period the change is identified 

purchase accounting and goodwill assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed these valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets we generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill but we evaluate it annually for impairment therefore the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results 

we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists we may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows managements judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

as a result of our annual impairment review for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal year 2020 no indicators of impairment were identified 

we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists we evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 management adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the healthcare products business segment as a result management recorded an impairment charge of 162 million which is included within the selling general and administrative line of the consolidated statements of income the remaining fair value of the asset was calculated using an income approach the relief from royalty method the remaining fair value was not material and was amortized over the assets remaining useful life fair value calculated using this approach is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires several assumptions 

income taxes our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in uncertain tax benefits and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities we use judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations we cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances ultimately be determined be several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published 

we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance we determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position and whether the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence we review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowance which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution individually or in the aggregate are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period 

additional information regarding income taxes is included in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled “income taxes” 

selfinsurance liabilities we record a liability for selfinsured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities workers’ compensation and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations we use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability this liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims we review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded we maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies the obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line and the other assets line of our consolidated balance sheets our accrual for selfinsured risk retention as of march 31 2021 and 2020 was 233 million and 232 million respectively 

we are also selfinsured for employee medical claims we estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience our selfinsured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date if actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods 

contingencies we are and will likely continue to be involved in a number of legal proceedings government investigations and claims which we believe generally arise in the course of our business given our size history complexity and the nature of our business products customers regulatory environment and industries in which we participate these legal proceedings investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations including without limitation personal injury eg slip and falls burns vehicle accidents product liability or regulation eg based on product operation or claimed malfunction failure to warn failure to meet specification or failure to comply with regulatory requirements product exposure eg claimed exposure to chemicals asbestos contaminants radiation property damage eg claimed damage due to leaking equipment fire vehicles chemicals commercial claims eg breach of contract economic loss warranty misrepresentation financial eg taxes reporting employment eg wrongful termination discrimination benefits matters and other claims for damage and relief 

we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable we consider many factors in making these assessments including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel we have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses in our opinion the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however the ultimate outcome of proceedings government investigations and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates we record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled commitments and contingencies for additional information 

we are subject to taxation from federal state and local and foreign jurisdictions tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates the irs of the united states routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns 

additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled “commitments and contingencies” 

benefit plans we provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees in addition we sponsor an unfunded postretirement benefits plan for two groups of united states retirees benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance including prescription drug coverage 

employee pension and postretirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations we believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate a summary of significant assumptions used to determine the march 31 2021 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2021 net periodic benefit costs is as follows 



na – not applicable 

we develop our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions by evaluating input from thirdparty professional advisors taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios and the longterm asset class return expectations generally net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases holding all other assumptions constant lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2021 benefit costs by l ess than 01 million 

we develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from thirdparty professional advisers taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade longterm bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations generally the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases holding all other assumptions constant lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pensi on plans and for the other postretirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2021 net periodic benefit costs by less than 01 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately 126 million a t march 31 2021 

we have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other postretirement benefit obligation the assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five yearperiod from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 70 to the assumed longterm healthcare cost trend rate a 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate including medical prescription drug and longterm rates would have had the following effect at march 31 2021 



we recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans in our balance sheets this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit plans changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur we measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled “benefit plans” contains additional information about our pension and other postretirement welfare benefits plans 

sharebased compensation we measure the estimated fair value for sharebased compensation awards including grants of employee stock options at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the sharebased compensation vests we selected the blackscholesmerton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our sharebased stock option compensation awards this model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect sharebased compensation expense 

sharebased compensation expense was 260 million in fiscal 2021 238 million in fiscal 2020 and 240 million in fiscal 2019 note 14 to our consolidated financial statements titled “sharebased compensation” contains additional information about our sharebased compensation plans 

recently issued accounting standards impacting the company 

recently issued accounting standards that are relevant to us are presented in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled “nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies” 

inflation 

our business has not been significantly impacted by the overall effects of inflation we monitor the prices we charge for our products and services on an ongoing basis and plan to adjust those prices to take into account future changes in the rate of inflation however we may not be able to completely offset the impact of inflation

as of march 31 2021 we had 8603 million in fixed rate senior notes outstanding as of march 31 2021 we had 2474 million in outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement which are exposed to changes in interest rates we monitor our interest rate risk but do not engage in any hedging activities using derivative financial instruments for additional information regarding our debt structure refer to note 6 to our consolidated financial statements titled “debt” 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations this foreign currency exchange risk arises when we conduct business in a currency other than the us dollar for most operations local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies the financial statements of subsidiaries are translated to their us dollar equivalents at endofperiod exchange rates for assets and liabilities and at average currency exchange rates for revenues and expenses translation adjustments for subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within equity note 19 to our consolidated financial statements titled “ reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss” contains additional information about the impact of translation on accumulated other comprehensive income loss and equity transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the consolidated statements of income since we operate internationally and approximately 30 of our revenues and 40 of our cost of revenues are generated outside the united states foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can significantly impact our financial position results of operations and competitive position 

we enter into foreign currency forward co ntracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies including intercompany transactions we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes at march 31 2021 we held a foreign currency forward contract to buy 415 million british pounds 

commodity risk 

we are dependent on basic raw materials subassemblies components and other supplies used in our operations our financial results could be affected by the availability and changes in prices of these materials some of these materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or only a single supplier these materials are also key source materials for our competitors therefore if demand for these materials rises we may experience increased costs andor limited or unavailable supplies as a result we may not be able to acquire key production materials on a timely basis which could impact our ability to produce products and satisfy incoming sales orders on a timely basis in addition the costs of these materials can rise suddenly and result in significantly higher costs of production we believe that we have adequate sources of supply for many of our key materials and energy sources where appropriate we enter into longterm supply contracts as a basis to guarantee a reliable supply we may also enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge price changes in a certain commodity that impacts raw materials included in our cost of revenues at march 31 2021 we held commodity swap contracts to buy 7680 thousand pounds of nickel

information with respect to our business in general 

sources and availability of raw materials we purchase raw materials subassemblies components and other supplies needed in our operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and internationally the principal raw materials and supplies used in our operations include stainless and carbon steel organic and inorganic chemicals fuel and plastic components these raw materials and supplies are generally available from several suppliers and in sufficient quantities that we do not currently expect any significant sourcing problems in fiscal 2021  we have longterm supply contracts for certain materials for which there are few suppliers or those that are singlesourced in certain regions of the world such as eo and cobalt60 which are necessary to our ast operations in addition we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with acceleratorbased technologies which may reduce the potential supply risk 

intellectual property we protect our technology and products by among other means obtaining united states and foreign patents there can be no assurance however that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology system product service or process it covers in addition the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive we also rely upon trade secrets technical knowhow and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 

as of march 31 2020  we held approximately 410 united states patents and approximately 1640 in other jurisdictions and had approximately 145 united states patent applications and 360 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained the actual protection a patent provides varies from country to country and depends in part upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in each country 

our products are sold around the world under various brand names and trademarks we consider our brand names and trademarks to be valuable in the marketing of our products as of march 31 2020  we had a total of approximately 1430 trademark registrations worldwide 

quality assurance we manufacture assemble and package products in several countries each of our production facilities are dedicated to particular processes and products our success depends upon customer confidence in the quality of our production process and the integrity of the data that supports our product safety and effectiveness we have implemented quality assurance procedures to support the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes 

government regulation our business is subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate in the united states the united states food and drug administration “fda” the united states environmental protection agency “epa” the united states nuclear regulatory commission “nrc” and other governmental authorities regulate the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products and services our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation including countryspecific rules and regulations and us regulations applicable to our international operations government regulations include detailed inspection of and controls over research and development clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing marketing and promotion sampling distribution recordkeeping storage and disposal practices 

compliance with applicable regulations is a significant expense for us past current or future regulations their interpretation or their application could have a material adverse impact on our operations also additional governmental regulation may be passed that could prevent delay revoke or result in the rejection of regulatory clearance of our products we cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulation or the interpretation or application of these regulations 

if we fail to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements sanctions could be imposed on us for more information about the risks we face regarding regulatory requirements see part i item 1a of this annual report titled risk factors we are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations failure to receive or maintain or delays in receiving clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues profitability financial condition or value 

in the past we have received warning letters paid civil penalties conducted product recalls and field corrections and been subject to other regulatory sanctions we believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable 

regulatory requirements however there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory governmental or private action will not have a material adverse affect on us or on our performance results or financial condition 

environmental matters we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in ireland the united states and other countries we have made and continue to make significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations we cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations we believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental health and safety requirements in all material respects however there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory governmental or private action will not have a material adverse affect on our performance results or financial condition please refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled commitments and contingencies for further information 

in the future if a loss contingency related to environmental matters employee safety health or conditional asset retirement obligations is significantly greater than the current estimated amount we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded the investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition liquidity or cash flow nor can there be any assurance that such liabilities would not have a material adverse affect on our performance results or financial condition 

competition the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and generally highly regulated competition is intense in all of our business segments and includes many large and small competitors brand design quality safety ease of use serviceability price product features warranty delivery service and technical support are important competitive factors to us we expect to face continued competition in the future as new infection prevention sterile processing contamination control gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market we believe many organizations are working with a variety of technologies and sterilizing agents also a number of companies have developed disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination 

we believe that our longterm competitive position depends on our success in discovering developing and marketing innovative costeffective products and services we devote significant resources to research and development efforts and we believe steris is positioned as a global competitor in the search for technological innovations in addition to research and development we invest in quality control customer programs distribution systems technical services and other information services 

there can be no assurance that we will develop significant new products or services or that the new products or services we provide or develop in the future will be more commercially successful than those provided or developed by our competitors in addition some of our existing or potential competitors may have greater resources than us therefore a competitor may succeed in developing and commercializing products more rapidly than we do competition as it relates to our business segments and product categories is discussed in more detail in the section above titled “information related to business segments” 

employees as of march 31 2020  we had approximately 13000 employees throughout the world including certain locations subject to collective bargaining agreements and works council representation we believe we generally have good relations with our employees

 we at times may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be “nongaap financial measures” under sec rules we have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance these financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies additional information regarding these financial measures including reconciliations of each non gaap financial measure is available in the subsection of mda titled nongaap financial measures

we operate and report in four reportable business segments healthcare products healthcare specialty services life sciences and applied sterilization technologies we describe our business segments in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled business segment information 

the bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare medical device and pharmaceutical industries much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery acceptance of new technologies government policies and general economic conditions the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes mandating that manufacturers improve their processes within healthcare there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world increased demand for medical procedures including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies and a desire by our customers to operate more efficiently all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services the covid19 pandemic is resulting in the deferral of certain elective medical procedures which is negatively impacting the demand for some of our products and services 

we completed several tuck in acquisitions and asset purchases in fiscal 2020 and 2019 that expanded our product and service offerings to our customers 

during fiscal 2020 we sold the operations of our healthcare specialty services business that were located in china with annual revenues of approximately 50 million 

we continue to invest in manufacturing insourcing projects and lean process improvements for the purpose of improving quality cost and delivery of our products to our customers 

us tax reform on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” the tcja made broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate 2 elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax amt 3 the creation of the base erosion antiabuse tax beat a new minimum tax 4 a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from nonus subsidiaries 5 a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income gilti which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ftcs and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 6 a new limitation on deductible interest expense 7 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction 8 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 9 limitations on the use of ftcs to reduce the us income tax liability and 10 limitations on net operating losses nols generated after december 31 2017 to 800 percent of taxable income 

fiscal 2019 restructuring plan during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan the “fiscal 2019 restructuring plan” which included the closure of two manufacturing facilities one in brazil and one in england as well as other actions including the rationalization of certain products fewer than 200 positions were eliminated the company has relocated the production of certain impacted products to other existing manufacturing operations during fiscal 2020 these restructuring actions were designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency for additional information on restructuring see the subsection titled restructuring expenses located in the results of operations section of this mda or note 2 of our consolidated financial statements titled restructuring 

highlights revenues increased 2487 million  or 89  to 30309 million for the year ended march 31 2020  as compared to 27822 million for the year ended march 31 2019  this increase reflects organic growth in all business segments which was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies 

fiscal 2020 operating income increased 305 to 5370 million over fiscal 2019 operating income of 4115 million  the increase is primarily attributable to lower restructuring expenses increased revenue volumes and higher gross margin attainment in fiscal 2020 over fiscal 2019 

net cash flows from operations were 5906 million and free cash flow was 3802 million in fiscal 2020 compared to net cash flows from operations of 5395 million and free cash flow of 3554 million in fiscal 2019 see subsection of mda titled nongaap financial measures for additional information and related reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures the increase in free cash flow is primarily due to the improvement in cash from operations 

our debttototal capital ratio was 253 at march 31 2020  during the year we increased our quarterly dividend for the fourteenth consecutive year to 037 per share per quarter 

outlook in fiscal 2021 and beyond we expect to continue to manage our costs grow our business with internal product and service development invest in greater capacity and augment these value creating methods with potential acquisitions of additional products and services 

however the covid19 pandemic began to impact our business late in fiscal 2020 the coronavirus pandemic and related public health recommendations and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of covid19 including deferral of medical procedures and treatments and shelterinplace orders or similar measures is negatively affecting and is expected to continue to affect some of our operations which would impact our financial position and cash flows in fiscal 2021 we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable fluctuations in demand for certain of our products and services including some products and services that are experiencing increased demand 

we cannot predict the ultimate impact that the covid19 pandemic and related actions will have on our customers’ operations financial position and cash flows and therefore on the demand for our products and services 

further the broader economic impact of the covid19 pandemic response could cause interest rate variability and generate unanticipated fluctuations in currency rates that impact our revenues and costs outside of the united states creating variability in our results 

as a result we are unable to estimate the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic to our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows for fiscal 2021 and beyond 

nongaap financial measures 

we at times refer to financial measures which are considered to be “nongaap financial measures” under sec rules we at times also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are nonrecurring or are not indicative of future results in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented 

these nongaap financial measures are not intended to be and should not be considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

these nongaap financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the board of directors in their financial analysis and operational decisionmaking these amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented 

we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered along with our gaap financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding gaap financial measures provide the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure it is important for the reader to note that the nongaap financial measure used may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure used by other companies 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows less purchases of property plant equipment and intangibles plus proceeds from the sale of property plant equipment and intangibles which are also presented within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows we use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends fund growth outside of core operations fund future debt principal repayments and repurchase shares the following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the years ended march 31 2020 and 2019

 cash flow measures free cash flow was 3802 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 3554 million in fiscal 2019  the increase in free cash flow is primarily due to the improvement in cash from operations 

our debttototal capital ratio was 253 at march 31 2020 and 271 at march 31 2019  

cash requirements we intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and meet our other liquidity needs our capital requirements depend on many uncertain factors including our rate of sales growth our customers’ acceptance of our products and services the costs of obtaining adequate manufacturing capacities the timing and extent of our research and development projects changes in our operating expenses and other factors to the extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities there can be no assurance that our financing arrangements will provide us with sufficient funds or that we will be able to obtain any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all 

sources of credit our sources of credit as of march 31 2020 are summarized in the following table 

1 at march 31 2020 there was  68 million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement

 as of march 31 2020  a total of 2754 million was outstanding under the credit agreement based on currency exchange rates as of march 31 2020  at march 31 2020  we had 7178 million of unused funding available under the credit agreement the credit agreement includes a sublimit that reduces the maximum amount available to us by letters of credit outstanding at march 31 2020  there was 68 million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement 

at march 31 2020  we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our indebtedness we provide additional information regarding our debt structure and payment obligations in the section of the mda titled “liquidity and capital resources” in the subsection titled “contractual and commercial commitments” and in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements titled “debt” 

capital expenditures 

our capital expenditure program is a component of our longterm strategy this program includes among other things investments in new and existing facilities business expansion projects radioisotope cobalt60 and information technology enhancements and research and development advances during fiscal 2020  our capital expenditures amounted to 2145 million  we use cash provided by operating activities and our cash and cash equivalent balances to fund capital expenditures in fiscal 2021  we expect to continue to invest in facility expansions particularly within the applied sterilization technologies segment and in ongoing maintenance for existing facilities the outbreak of covid19 has become a global pandemic we may choose to temporarily defer planned capital expenditures due to fluctuations in demand for our products and services resulting from the covid19 pandemic and our customers needs 

contractual and commercial commitments 

at march 31 2020  we had commitments under noncancelable operating leases totaling 1739 million  

our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march 31 2020 are presented in the following tables commercial commitments include standby letters of credit letters of credit required as security under our selfinsured risk retention policies and other potential cash outflows resulting from events that require us to fulfill commitments

critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions 

the following subsections describe our most critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled “nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies” 

estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles we make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements these estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management’s control as a result actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates we periodically review these critical accounting policies estimates assumptions and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the customer revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services product revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer which is generally based on contract or shipping terms service revenue is recognized when the customer benefits from the service which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the customer our customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in product revenues the associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues revenues are reported net of sales and valueadded taxes collected from customers 

we have individual customer contracts that offer discounted pricing dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates we reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns rebates and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded the reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur estimated returns are recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets 

in transactions that contain multiple performance obligations such as when products maintenance services and other services are combined we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the customer we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately 

payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered generally the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant we do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year 

we do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less 

certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future at march 31 2020 assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by customers we estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors including amounts written off historically customer payment practices and general economic conditions we also analyze significant customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to pay as a result the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible these analyses require judgment if the financial condition of our customers worsens or economic conditions change we may be required to make changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 

allowance for sales returns we maintain an allowance for sales returns based upon known returns and estimated returns for both capital equipment and consumables we estimate returns of capital equipment and consumables based upon historical experience 

inventories and reserves inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value we determine cost based upon a combination of the lastin firstout “lifo” and firstin firstout “fifo” cost methods we determine the lifo inventory value at the end of the year based on inventory levels and costs at that time for inventories valued using the lifo method we believe that the use of the lifo method results in a matching of current costs and revenues inventories valued using the lifo method represented approximately 253 and 252 of total inventories at march 31 2020 and 2019  respectively inventory costs include material labor and overhead if we had used only the fifo method of inventory costing inventories would have been 169 million and 168 million higher than those reported at march 31 2020 and 2019  respectively 

we review inventory on an ongoing basis considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable if future market conditions vary from those projected and our estimates prove to be inaccurate we may be required to writedown inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues 

asset impairment losses property plant equipment and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value we conduct this review on an ongoing basis and if impairment exists we record the loss in the consolidated statements of income during that period 

when we evaluate assets for impairment we make certain judgments and estimates including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations historical and anticipated performance of operations and other factors if we incorrectly anticipate these factors or unexpected events occur our operating results could be materially affected 

asset retirement obligations we incur retirement obligations for certain assets we record an initial liability for the asset retirement obligations aro at fair value accounting for the aro at inception and in subsequent periods includes the determination of the present value of a liability and offsetting asset the subsequent accretion of that liability and depletion of the asset and a periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates used in the analysis we provide additional information about our asset retirement obligations in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements titled “property plant and equipment” 

restructuring we record specific accruals in connection with plans for restructuring elements of our business these accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs the closure andor consolidation of facilities and contractual obligations actual amounts could differ from the original estimates we review our restructuringrelated accruals on a quarterly basis and changes to plans are appropriately recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period the change is identified 

purchase accounting and goodwill assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed these valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets we generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill but we evaluate it annually for impairment therefore the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results 

we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists we may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows managements judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

as a result of our annual impairment review for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal year 2020 no indicators of impairment were identified 

we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists we evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 management adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the healthcare products business segment as a result management recorded an impairment charge of 162 million  which is included within the selling general and administrative line of the consolidated statements of income the remaining fair value of the asset was calculated using an income approach the relief from royalty method the remaining fair value was not material and was amortized over the assets remaining useful life fair value calculated using this approach is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires several assumptions 

income taxes our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in uncertain tax benefits and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities we use judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations we cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances ultimately be determined be several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published 

we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance we determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position and whether the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence we review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowance which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution individually or in the aggregate are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period 

additional information regarding income taxes is included in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled “income taxes” 

selfinsurance liabilities we record a liability for selfinsured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities workers’ compensation and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations we use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability this liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims we review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded we maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies the obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line and the other assets line of our consolidated balance sheets our accrual for selfinsured risk retention as of march 31 2020 and 2019 was 232 million and 197 million  respectively 

we are also selfinsured for employee medical claims we estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience our selfinsured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date if actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods 

contingencies we are and will likely continue to be involved in a number of legal proceedings government investigations and claims which we believe generally arise in the course of our business given our size history complexity and the nature of our business products customers regulatory environment and industries in which we participate these legal proceedings investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations including without limitation personal injury eg slip and falls burns vehicle accidents product liability or regulation eg based on product operation or claimed malfunction failure to warn failure to meet specification or failure to comply with regulatory requirements product exposure eg claimed exposure to chemicals asbestos contaminants radiation property damage eg claimed damage due to leaking equipment fire vehicles chemicals commercial claims eg breach of contract economic loss warranty misrepresentation financial eg taxes reporting employment eg wrongful termination discrimination benefits matters and other claims for damage and relief 

we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable we consider many factors in making these assessments including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel we have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses in our opinion the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however the ultimate outcome of 

proceedings government investigations and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates we record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled commitments and contingencies for additional information 

we are subject to taxation from federal state and local and foreign jurisdictions tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates the irs of the united states routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns 

additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled “commitments and contingencies” 

benefit plans we provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees in addition we sponsor an unfunded postretirement benefits plan for two groups of united states retirees benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance including prescription drug coverage 

employee pension and postretirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations we believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate a summary of significant assumptions used to determine the march 31 2020 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2020 net periodic benefit costs is as follows 



na – not applicable 

we develop our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions by evaluating input from thirdparty professional advisors taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios and the longterm asset class return expectations generally net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases holding all other assumptions constant lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2020 benefit costs by less than 01 million 

we develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from thirdparty professional advisers taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade longterm bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations generally the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases holding all other assumptions constant lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plans and for the other postretirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2020 net periodic benefit costs by less than 01 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately 105 million at march 31 2020  

we have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other postretirement benefit obligation the assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five yearperiod from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 68 to the assumed longterm healthcare cost trend rate a 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate including medical prescription drug and longterm rates would have had the following effect at march 31 2020  



we recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans in our balance sheets this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit plans changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur we measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled “benefit plans” contains additional information about our pension and other postretirement welfare benefits plans 

sharebased compensation we measure the estimated fair value for sharebased compensation awards including grants of employee stock options at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the sharebased compensation vests we selected the blackscholesmerton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our sharebased stock option compensation awards this model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect sharebased compensation expense 

sharebased compensation expense was 238 million in fiscal 2020  240 million in fiscal 2019 and 222 million in fiscal 2018  note 14 to our consolidated financial statements titled “sharebased compensation” contains additional information about our sharebased compensation plans

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations this foreign currency exchange risk arises when we conduct business in a currency other than the us dollar for most operations local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies the financial statements of subsidiaries are translated to their us dollar equivalents at endofperiod exchange rates for assets and liabilities and at average currency exchange rates for revenues and expenses translation adjustments for subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within equity note 19 to our consolidated financial statements titled “ reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss ” contains additional information about the impact of translation on accumulated other comprehensive income loss and equity transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the consolidated statements of income since we operate internationally and approximately 30 of our revenues and 40 of our cost of revenues are generated outside the united states foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can significantly impact our financial position results of operations and competitive position

sources and availability of raw materials we purchase raw materials subassemblies components and other supplies needed in our operations from numerous suppliers in the united states and internationally the principal raw materials and supplies used in our operations include stainless and carbon steel organic and inorganic chemicals fuel and plastic components these raw materials and supplies are generally available from several suppliers and in sufficient quantities that we do not currently expect any significant sourcing problems in fiscal 2020  we have longterm supply contracts for certain materials for which there are few suppliers or those that are singlesourced in certain regions of the world such as eo and cobalt60 which are necessary to our ast operations in addition we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with acceleratorbased technologies which may reduce the potential supply risk 

intellectual property we protect our technology and products by among other means obtaining united states and foreign patents there can be no assurance however that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology system product service or process it covers in addition the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive we also rely upon trade secrets technical knowhow and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 

as of march 31 2019  we held approximately 400 united states patents and approximately 1500 in other jurisdictions and had approximately 135 united states patent applications and 375 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained the actual protection a patent provides varies from country to country and depends in part upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in each country 

our products are sold around the world under various brand names and trademarks we consider our brand names and trademarks to be valuable in the marketing of our products as of march 31 2019  we had a total of approximately 1550 trademark registrations worldwide

government regulation our business is subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate in the united states the united states food and drug administration “fda” the united states environmental protection agency “epa” the united states nuclear regulatory commission “nrc” and other governmental authorities regulate the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products and services our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation including countryspecific rules and regulations and us regulations applicable to our international operations government regulations include detailed inspection of and controls over research and development clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing marketing and promotion sampling distribution recordkeeping storage and disposal practices 

compliance with applicable regulations is a significant expense for us past current or future regulations their interpretation or their application could have a material adverse impact on our operations also additional governmental regulation may be passed that could prevent delay revoke or result in the rejection of regulatory clearance of our products we cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulation or the interpretation or application of these regulations 

if we fail to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements sanctions could be imposed on us for more information about the risks we face regarding regulatory requirements see part i item 1a of this annual report titled risk factors we are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations failure to receive or maintain or delays in receiving clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues profitability financial condition or value 

in the past we have received warning letters paid civil penalties conducted product recalls and field corrections and been subject to other regulatory sanctions we believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements however there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory governmental or private action will not have a material adverse affect on us or on our performance results or financial condition 

environmental matters we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in ireland the united states and in other countries we have made and continue to make significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations we cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations we believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental health and safety requirements in all material respects however there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory governmental or private action will not have a material adverse affect on our performance results or financial condition please refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled commitments and contingencies for further information 

in the future if a loss contingency related to environmental matters employee safety health or conditional asset retirement obligations is significantly greater than the current estimated amount we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded the investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition liquidity or cash flow nor can there be any assurance that such liabilities would not have a material adverse affect on our performance results or financial condition 

competition the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and generally highly regulated competition is intense in all of our business segments and includes many large and small competitors brand design quality safety ease of use serviceability price product features warranty delivery service and technical support are important competitive factors to us we expect to face continued competition in the future as new infection prevention sterile processing contamination control gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market we believe many organizations are working with a variety of technologies and sterilizing agents also a number of companies have developed disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination 

we believe that our longterm competitive position depends on our success in discovering developing and marketing innovative costeffective products and services we devote significant resources to research and development efforts and we believe steris is positioned as a global competitor in the search for technological innovations in addition to research and development we invest in quality control customer programs distribution systems technical services and other information services 

there can be no assurance that we will develop significant new products or services or that the new products or services we provide or develop in the future will be more commercially successful than those provided or developed by our competitors in addition some of our existing or potential competitors may have greater resources than us therefore a competitor may succeed in developing and commercializing products more rapidly than we do competition as it relates to our business segments and product categories is discussed in more detail in the section above titled “information related to business segments”

we operate and report in four reportable business segments healthcare products healthcare specialty services life sciences and applied sterilization technologies we describe our business segments in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled business segment information 

the bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery acceptance of new technologies government policies and general economic conditions the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes mandating that manufacturers improve their processes within healthcare there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world increased demand for medical procedures including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies and a desire by our customers to operate more efficiently all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services 

we completed several acquisitions and asset purchases in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 that expanded our product and service offerings to our customers 

during fiscal 2018 we divested our synergy health healthcare consumable solutions hcs business with annual revenues of approximately 40 million during fiscal 2017 we divested our applied infection control aic product line and four businesses acquired in the acquisition of synergy health including all of the linen management services businesses and synergy health laboratory services 

we continue to invest in manufacturing insourcing projects and lean process improvements for the purpose of improving quality cost and delivery of our products to our customers 

us tax reform on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” the tcja made broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate 2 elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax amt 3 the creation of the base erosion antiabuse tax beat a new minimum tax 4 a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from nonus subsidiaries 5 a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income gilti which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ftcs and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 6 a new limitation on deductible interest expense 7 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction 8 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 9 limitations on the use of ftcs to reduce the us income tax liability and 10 limitations on net operating losses nols generated after december 31 2017 to 800 percent of taxable income 

fiscal 2019 restructuring plan during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan the “fiscal 2019 restructuring plan” which included the closure of two manufacturing facilities one in brazil and one in england as well as other actions including the rationalization of certain products fewer than 200 positions are being eliminated the company will relocate the production of certain impacted products to other existing manufacturing operations during fiscal 2020 these restructuring actions are designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency for additional information on restructuring see the subsection titled restructuring expenses located in the results of operations section of this mda or note 2 of our consolidated financial statements titled restructuring 

highlights revenues increased 1622 million  or 62  to 27822 million for the year ended march 31 2019  as compared to 26200 million for the year ended march 31 2018  this increase reflects organic growth in all business segments which was partially offset by the impact of our fiscal 2018 divestiture of hcs and unfavorable fluctuations in currencies 

fiscal 2019 operating income increased 29 to 4115 million over fiscal 2018 operating income of 3999 million  the increase is attributable to increased volume and fluctuations in currencies and the positive impact from our fiscal 2018 divestiture of hcs which were partially offset by costs associated with our fiscal 2019 restructuring plan 

net cash flows from operations were 5395 million and free cash flow was 3554 million in fiscal 2019 compared to net cash flows from operations of 4576 million and free cash flow of 2943 million in fiscal 2018 see subsection of mda titled nongaap financial measures for additional information and related reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures the improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to the improved cash from operations which was partially offset by higher capital expenditures 

our debttototal capital ratio was 271 at march 31 2019  during the year we increased our quarterly dividend for the thirteenth consecutive year to 034 per share per quarter 

outlook fluctuations in currency rates can impact revenues and costs outside of the united states creating variability in our results for fiscal 2020 and beyond 

in fiscal 2020 and beyond we expect to continue to manage our costs grow our business with internal product and service development invest in greater capacity and augment these value creating methods with potential acquisitions of additional products and services 

nongaap financial measures 

we at times refer to financial measures which are considered to be “nongaap financial measures” under sec rules we at times also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are nonrecurring or are not indicative of future results in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented 

these nongaap financial measures are not intended to be and should not be considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

these nongaap financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the board of directors in their financial analysis and operational decisionmaking these amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented 

we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered along with our gaap financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding gaap financial measures provide the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure it is important for the reader to note that the nongaap financial measure used may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure used by other companies 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows less purchases of property plant equipment and intangibles plus proceeds from the sale of property plant equipment and intangibles which are also presented within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows we use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends fund growth outside of core operations fund future debt principal repayments and repurchase shares the following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the years ended march 31 2019  2018 and 2017

fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 

revenues the following table compares our revenues in total and by type and geography for the year ended march 31 2018 to the year ended march 31 2017  

revenues increased 72 million or 03 to 26200 million for the year ended march 31 2018 as compared to 26128 million for the year ended march 31 2017 this increase is primarily attributable to organic growth within all business segments favorable pricing the benefit of acquisitions and the positive impact of fluctuations in currencies these increases were largely offset by the impact of our recent divestitures 

service revenues for fiscal 2018 decreased 151 million or 11 over fiscal 2017 as the impact of recent divestitures more than offset increases in other service offerings consumable revenues increased 227 million or 41 during fiscal 2018 over fiscal 2017 reflecting growth within the healthcare products and life sciences business segments which more than offset the impact of the divestitures of the aic product line and hcs business within the healthcare products segment capital equipment revenues decreased by 04 million or 01 during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 reflecting a decline in revenues from the healthcare products segment which was offset by growth in revenues from the life sciences segment 

ireland revenues for fiscal 2018 were 482 million an increase of 55 million or 129 over fiscal 2017 revenues of 427 million reflecting increases in consumable and service revenues which were partially offset by decline in capital equipment revenues 

united states revenues for fiscal 2018 were 18364 million an increase of 330 million or 18 over fiscal 2017 revenues of 18035 million strength in life sciences capital equipment and strength in service offerings within the healthcare products life sciences and applied sterilization technologies segments more than offset the negative impact of the decline in capital equipment revenues within the healthcare products segment and the recent divestitures 

revenues from other foreign locations for fiscal 2018 were 7353 million a decrease of 41 over the fiscal 2017 revenues of 7666 million primarily due to the fiscal 2017 divestiture of the netherlands linen management services which more than offset growth in canada and in the asia pacific and latin america regions 

gross profit the following table compares our gross profit for the year ended march 31 2018 to the year ended march 31 2017   

our gross profit is affected by the volume pricing and mix of sales of our products and services as well as the costs associated with the products and services that are sold our gross profit increased 665 million and gross profit percentage increased 240 basis points to 417 for fiscal 2018 as compared to 393 for fiscal 2017 the increase in our gross profit percentage was due to the favorable impact of the divestiture of lower margin operations 190 basis points favorable mix 50 basis points and favorable pricing 30 basis points which were partially offset by the negative impact of currencies 30 basis points

selling general and administrative expenses significant components of total selling general and administrative expenses “sga” are compensation and benefit costs fees for professional services travel and entertainment facilities costs gains or losses from divestitures and other general and administrative expenses sga decreased 73 in fiscal 2018 over fiscal 2017 the decline was primarily attributable to a lower net loss on divestitures and lower acquisition and integration costs incurred in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 

goodwill impairment loss goodwill impairment loss of 584 million was recorded during fiscal 2017 as a result of our annual goodwill impairment review in the third quarter relative to the synergy health netherlands linen management reporting unit 

research and development research and development expenses increased 14 million during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of inprocess projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development product improvements and the development of new technological platform innovations during fiscal 2018 our investments in research and development continued to be focused on but were not limited to enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies procedural products and accessories and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures 

nonoperating expenses net nonoperating expense income net consists of interest expense on debt offset by interest earned on cash cash equivalents shortterm investment balances and other miscellaneous expense the following table 

compares our nonoperating expense income net for the year ended march 31 2018 to the year ended march 31 2017 

interest expense increased 61 million during fiscal 2018 as compared to 2017 this increase was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of highercost fixed rate debt following the issuance and sale of senior notes in a private placement to certain investors on february 27 2017 

the increase in interest income and miscellaneous expense was primarily due to our retrospective adoption of asu 201707 compensation  retirement benefits  improving the presentation of net periodic pension and net periodic postretirement benefit cost additional information regarding the standard can be found in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies

 cash flow measures free cash flow was 3554 million in fiscal 2019 compared to 2943 million in fiscal 2018  the improvement in cash flow was primarily due to improved cash from operations which was partially offset by higher capital expenditures 

our debttototal capital ratio was 271 at march 31 2019 and 291 at march 31 2018  

cash requirements we intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and meet our other liquidity needs our capital requirements depend on many uncertain factors including our rate of sales growth our customers’ acceptance of our products and services the costs of obtaining adequate manufacturing capacities the timing and extent of our research and development projects changes in our operating expenses and other factors to the extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities there can be no assurance that our financing arrangements will provide us with sufficient funds or that we will be able to obtain any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all

critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions 

the following subsections describe our most critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements titled “nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies” 

estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles we make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements these estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management’s control as a result actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates we periodically review these critical accounting policies estimates assumptions and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

revenue recognition revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the customer revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services product revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer which is generally based on contract or shipping terms service revenue is recognized when the customer benefits from the service which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the customer our customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in product revenues the associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues revenues are reported net of sales and valueadded taxes collected from customers 

we have individual customer contracts that offer discounted pricing dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates we reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns rebates and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded the reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur estimated returns are recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets 

in transactions that contain multiple performance obligations such as when products maintenance services and other services are combined we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the customer we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately 

payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered generally the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant we do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year 

we do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less 

certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future at march 31 2019 assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by customers we estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors including amounts written off historically customer payment practices and general economic conditions we also analyze significant customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to pay as a result the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible these analyses require a considerable amount of judgment if the financial condition of our customers worsens or economic conditions change we may be required to make changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 

allowance for sales returns we maintain an allowance for sales returns based upon known returns and estimated returns for both capital equipment and consumables we estimate returns of capital equipment and consumables based upon historical experience 

inventories and reserves inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value we determine cost based upon a combination of the lastin firstout “lifo” and firstin firstout “fifo” cost methods we determine the lifo inventory value at the end of the year based on inventory levels and costs at that time for inventories valued using the lifo method we believe that the use of the lifo method results in a matching of current costs and revenues inventories valued using the lifo method represented approximately 252 and 260 of total inventories at march 31 2019 and 2018  respectively inventory 

costs include material labor and overhead if we had used only the fifo method of inventory costing inventories would have been 168 million and 173 million higher than those reported at march 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

we review inventory on an ongoing basis considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable if future market conditions vary from those projected and our estimates prove to be inaccurate we may be required to writedown inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues 

asset impairment losses property plant equipment and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value we conduct this review on an ongoing basis and if impairment exists we record the loss in the consolidated statements of income during that period 

when we evaluate assets for impairment we make certain judgments and estimates including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations historical and anticipated performance of operations and other factors if we incorrectly anticipate these factors or unexpected events occur our operating results could be materially affected 

asset retirement obligations we incur retirement obligations for certain assets we record an initial liability for the asset retirement obligations aro at fair value accounting for the aro at inception and in subsequent periods includes the determination of the present value of a liability and offsetting asset the subsequent accretion of that liability and depletion of the asset and a periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates used in the analysis we provide additional information about our asset retirement obligations in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements titled “property plant and equipment” 

restructuring we record specific accruals in connection with plans for restructuring elements of our business these accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs the closure andor consolidation of facilities and contractual obligations actual amounts could differ from the original estimates we review our restructuringrelated accruals on a quarterly basis and changes to plans are appropriately recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period the change is identified 

purchase accounting and goodwill assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed these valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets we generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill but we evaluate it annually for impairment therefore the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results 

we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists we may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability in those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level we calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

as a result of our annual impairment review for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 no indicators of impairment were identified as a result of our annual goodwill impairment review for fiscal year 2017 we concluded that the carrying value of one of our reporting units exceeded its fair value prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2017 the synergy health netherlands linen management unit was reported within our healthcare specialty services segment financial forecasts prepared for the annual assessment reflected pricing pressures volume declines driven by overcapacity in the market and a decline in the overall market size these factors resulted in further degradation of the already low operating margin and cash flows of this unit we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of 584 million as a result which was recorded within goodwill impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income the fair market value of the reporting unit was determined under an income approach using discounted cash flows and estimated fair market values fair value calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires several assumptions including risk adjusted discount rates and financial forecasts 

we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists we evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 management adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the healthcare products business segment as a result management recorded an impairment charge of 162 million  which is included within the selling general and administrative line of the consolidated statements of income the remaining fair value of the asset was calculated using an income approach the relief from royalty method the remaining fair value was not material and will be amortized over the assets remaining useful life fair value calculated using this approach is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires several assumption during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we adopted a new branding strategy change as part of the integration of certain synergy health operations into the healthcare specialty services segment under this new branding strategy hospital sterilization services and instrument repair services will utilize the steris instrument management services brand name the synergy health trade name was phased out during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result we shortened the estimated useful life of the synergy health trade name and accelerated the corresponding amortization expense over the remainder of fiscal 2017 which totaled 144 million and was recorded within the selling general and administrative expense line on the consolidated statements of income 

income taxes our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities income tax rates changes in uncertain tax benefits and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities we use significant judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations we cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us the actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances ultimately be determined be several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published 

we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance we determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position and whether the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is met for a tax position is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence we review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax laws regulations and precedent 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowance which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution individually or in the aggregate are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period 

additional information regarding income taxes is included in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements titled “income taxes” 

selfinsurance liabilities we record a liability for selfinsured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities workers’ compensation and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations we use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability this liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims we review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded we maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies the obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line and the other assets line of our consolidated balance sheets our accrual for selfinsured risk retention as of march 31 2019 and 2018 was 197 million and 209 million respectively 

we are also selfinsured for employee medical claims we estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience our selfinsured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date if actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods 

contingencies we are and will likely continue to be involved in a number of legal proceedings government investigations and claims which we believe generally arise in the course of our business given our size history complexity and the nature of our business products customers regulatory environment and industries in which we participate these legal proceedings investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations including without limitation personal injury eg slip and falls burns vehicle accidents product liability or regulation eg based on product operation or claimed malfunction failure to warn failure to meet specification or failure to comply with regulatory requirements product exposure eg claimed exposure to chemicals asbestos contaminants radiation property damage eg claimed damage due to leaking equipment fire vehicles chemicals commercial claims eg breach of contract economic loss warranty misrepresentation financial eg taxes reporting employment eg wrongful termination discrimination benefits matters and other claims for damage and relief 

we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable we consider many factors in making these assessments including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel we have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses in our opinion the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however the ultimate outcome of proceedings government investigations and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates we record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled commitments and contingencies for additional information 

we are subject to taxation from federal state and local and foreign jurisdictions tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates the irs of the united states routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns 

additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements titled “commitments and contingencies” 

benefit plans we provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees in addition we sponsor an unfunded postretirement benefits plan for two groups of united states retirees benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance including prescription drug coverage 

employee pension and postretirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations we believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate a summary of significant assumptions used to determine the march 31 2019 projected benefit obligations and the fiscal 2019 net periodic benefit costs is as follows 



na – not applicable 

we develop our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions by evaluating input from thirdparty professional advisors taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios and the longterm asset class return expectations generally net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases holding all other assumptions constant lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal 2019 benefit costs by less than 01 million 

we develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from thirdparty professional advisers taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade longterm bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations generally the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases holding all other assumptions constant lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plans and for the other postretirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal 2019 net periodic benefit costs by less than 01 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately 118 million at march 31 2019  

we have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other postretirement benefit obligation the assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five yearperiod from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of 68 to the assumed longterm healthcare cost trend rate a 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate including medical prescription drug and longterm rates would have had the following effect at march 31 2019  



we recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans in our balance sheets this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit plans changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur we measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date note 9 to our consolidated financial statements titled “benefit plans” contains additional information about our pension and other postretirement welfare benefits plans 

sharebased compensation we measure the estimated fair value for sharebased compensation awards including grants of employee stock options at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the sharebased compensation vests we selected the blackscholesmerton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our sharebased stock option compensation awards this model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect sharebased compensation expense 

sharebased compensation expense was 240 million in fiscal 2019  222 million in fiscal 2018 and 188 million in fiscal 2017  note 14 to our consolidated financial statements titled “sharebased compensation” contains additional information about our sharebased compensation plans

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations this foreign currency exchange risk arises when we conduct business in a currency other than the us dollar for most operations local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies the financial statements of subsidiaries are translated to their us dollar equivalents at endofperiod exchange rates for assets and liabilities and at average currency exchange rates for revenues and expenses translation adjustments for subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within equity note 19 to our consolidated financial statements titled “ reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss ” contains additional information about the impact of translation on accumulated other comprehensive income loss and equity transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the consolidated statements of income since we operate internationally and approximately 30 of our revenues and 40 of our cost of revenues are generated outside the united states foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can significantly impact our financial position results of operations and competitive position
