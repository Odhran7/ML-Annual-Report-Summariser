in addition to purchasing products directly from our vendor partners we purchase products from wholesale distributors for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer these wholesale distributors provide logistics management and supplychain services for us as well as for our vendor partners 

for our us operations in 2021 we purchased approximately 50 of the products we sold as discrete products or as components of a solution directly from our vendor partners and the remaining 50 from wholesale distributors purchases from our two largest wholesale distributors ingram micro and td synnex were over 30 of total us purchases in 2021

we believe competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of the product categories that we offer 

competition 

the market for technology products and services is highly competitive and subject to economic conditions and rapid technological changes competition is based on many things including the ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs the quality and breadth of product and service offerings knowledge and expertise of sales force customer service price product availability speed of delivery and credit availability we face competition from resellers direct manufacturers large service providers cloud providers telecommunication companies and to a lesser extent etailers and retailers smaller local or regional valueadded resellers typically focus on a single solution suite or portfolio of solutions from one or two vendor partners 

we believe we are well positioned to compete within this marketplace due to our competitive advantages we expect the competitive landscape to continue to evolve as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for additional information on the risks associated with competition see “item 1a risk factors” 

we believe we have sustainable competitive advantages that differentiate us in the marketplace we have built a strong sales organization and deep services and solutions capabilities over time and expect to continue to invest to enhance these capabilities which we believe when combined with our competitive advantages of scale and a performance driven culture will help drive sustainable profitable growth for us today and in the future our scale enables us to have a national and international footprint as well as invest in resources to meet specific customer endmarket needs our sellers are organized around unique customer endmarkets that are both vertically and geographically focused our scale enables our ability to invest in technical coworkers who work directly with our sellers to help customers implement increasingly complex it solutions our scale also enables us to operate our three distribution centers two in the us and one in the uk which combined are more than 1 million square feet in size we have crossborder relationships that enable us to serve the needs of our us uk and canadianbased customers in more than 150 countries our strong executionoriented culture is underpinned by our compensation system 

our offerings 

our offerings range from discrete hardware and software products and services to complex integrated solutions including one or more of these elements we believe our customers increasingly view technology purchases as integrated solutions rather than discrete product and services categories we estimate that more than 40 of our net sales in 2021 in the us came from sales of product categories and services typically associated with solutions our hardware products include notebooksmobile devices including t ablets network communications desktop computers video monitors enterprise and data storage and other hardware our software products include application suites security virtualization operating systems and network management our services include advisory and design software development implementation managed services and warranties

although we believe customers increasingly view technology purchases as solutions rather than discrete product and service categories our net sales by major category based upon our internal category classifications was as follows 



1 certain software and services revenue is recorded on a net basis for accounting purposes so the category percentage of net sales is not representative of the category percentage of gross profits 

2 includes items such as delivery charges to customers

as a result of our relationships with our vendor partners a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs these programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time we believe that our results and analytical techniques that measure the efficacy of our marketing programs differentiate us from our competitors

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some important factors that may cause our business prospects results of operations and cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

business and operational risks 

the outbreak of the novel coronavirus “covid19” pandemic has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations and could also adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

the global spread of covid19 continues to create significant macroeconomic uncertainty volatility and disruption many governments and health authorities have implemented recommendations or mandates intended to slow the further spread of the disease such as shelterinplace orders resulting in the temporary closure of schools and nonessential businesses or social distancing measures resulting in modified operations of various businesses including ours and these measures may remain in place for a significant period of time while some of these restrictions have been lifted or eased in certain jurisdictions other restrictions such as vaccine mandates and testing requirements have been newly imposed and the recovery process is uncertain we have experienced and could continue to experience disruptions including as a result of resurgences of covid19 that prevent us from meeting the demands of our customers such as product constraints from our vendor partners and wholesale distributors and other disruptions to our supply chain disruptions in or restrictions on the ability of our coworkers to work effectively temporary closures of our distribution facilities modifications in the operation of facilities that remain open and disruptions of commercial delivery services the impact of covid19 and measures implemented to slow the spread have caused and could continue to cause delay in or limit the ability of our customers to place orders for our products and services and make timely payments to us and could materially increase our labor logistics and other costs as long as the pandemic continues our coworkers will continue to be exposed to health risks and we could be negatively impacted in the future if a significant number of our coworkers or coworkers who perform critical functions become unable to work as a result of exposure to covid19 in addition the pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries including the us the uk and canada during the covid19 pandemic and even after it has subsided we may experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of the pandemic’s global economic impact including any recession economic downturn or volatility government spending cuts tightening of credit markets or increased unemployment that has occurred or may occur in the future which could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices in addition we may experience inflationary pressures resulting in increased product prices that we may be unable to pass on to our customers 

individually and collectively the consequences of the covid19 pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations and could also adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and liquidity the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the ultimate duration and severity of the pandemic future resurgences and emergences of new variants of the virus the availability efficacy and acceptance of a vaccine and treatments actions taken to contain the virus including reimplementation of closures and the effectiveness of these actions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and be sustained the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the terms of the agreements governing those relationships 

our solutions portfolio includes products and services from oems software publishers and cloud providers we are authorized by these vendor partners to sell all or some of their products and services via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges services performance commitments price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding including purchase rebates sales volume rebates purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows in addition a reduction in the amount or a change in the terms of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our 

need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows particularly given our level of indebtedness 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we purchase the products included in our portfolio both directly from our vendor partners and from wholesale distributors although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2021 products we purchased from wholesale distributors ingram micro and td synnex together represented over 30 of total us purchases in addition sales of products manufactured by apple cisco dell emc hp inc lenovo and microsoft whether purchased directly from these vendor partners or from a wholesale distributor represented over 50 of our 2021 consolidated net sales sales of products manufactured by dell emc and lenovo represented over 20 of our 2021 consolidated net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other wholesale distributors or key vendor partners or the diminished availability of their products including due to backlogs for their products could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position 

further the sale spinoff or combination of any of our wholesale distributors or key vendor partners andor certain of their business units including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell or our inability to develop relationships with new and emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services such as cloudbased solutions including software as a service “saas” infrastructure as a service “iaas” and platform as a service “paas” device as a service “daas” the internet of things “iot” and artificial intelligence “ai” we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers also customers may delay spending while they evaluate new technologies a decrease in the rate of innovation a lack of acceptance of innovations by our customers or delays in technology spending by our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to anticipate and expand our capabilities to keep pace with changes in technology and new hardware software and services for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels to the extent that a vendor’s offering that is in high demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 

• resellers and service providers such as computacenter connection eplus insight enterprises ntt optiv presidio scc softchoice world wide technology and many smaller resellers and service providers 

• manufacturers who sell directly to customers such as adobe apple dell emc hp inc and hewlett packard enterprise 

• large service providers and system integrators such as accenture dell emc hewlett packard enterprise and ibm 

• communications service providers such as att centurylink and verizon 

• cloud providers such as amazon web services google and microsoft 

• etailers such as amazon and newegg and 

• retailers including their ecommerce activities such as office depot and staples 

we expect the competitive landscape to continue to evolve as new technologies and consumption models emerge such as cloudbased and other “as a service” solutions hyperconverged infrastructure and embedded software solutions our continued competitiveness depends upon our ability to anticipate and evolve at pace and scale with new technologies services and solutions through strategic and timely investments in innovation expansion of offerings and the capabilities necessary to implement them 

while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for instance while cloudbased solutions present an opportunity for us cloudbased solutions and technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell in addition some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to our customers moreover traditional oems have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers if we are unable to effectively respond to the evolving competitive landscape or respond in a manner that is less effective than that of our competitors our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we focus on providing high quality service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing operation maintenance and development of our information technology systems including our business systems such as our sales customer management financial and accounting marketing purchasing warehouse management ecommerce and mobile systems as well as our operational platforms including voice and data networks and power systems the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

• conduct business with our customers including delivering services and solutions to them 

• provide the means to effectively manage global operations across time zones 

• keep pace with changes and innovation and compete effectively 

• effectuate comprehensive and reliable data collection maintenance and governance 

• manage our inventory accounts receivable and accounts payable 

• support planned growth in services and solutions and continued evolution of the business 

• purchase sell ship and invoice our hardware and software products and provide and invoice our services efficiently and on a timely basis and 

• maintain our costefficient operating model while scaling our business 

the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats both internal and external and from human error there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our reputation business and results of operations due to failure to comply with customer partner legal or regulatory obligations 

breaches of data security and the failure to protect our information technology systems from cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business 

our business involves the handling storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers partners and others in connection with our services business some of our coworkers have access to our customers’ confidential data and other information additionally third parties such as data center colocation and hosted solution partners provide services to us and also provide services as a component of our services delivery to customers these third parties or others that are a part of our supply chain could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure to protect their own products security systems and infrastructure and we may not be able to control the manner in which these third parties respond to any security breach we have privacy and data security policies practices and controls in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however as newer technologies evolve as more business is conducted on line and remotely and as the portfolio of the service providers we exchange confidential information software andor hardware with expands we are exposed to increased risks from breaches in security including those arising from human error negligence or mismanagement or from illegal or fraudulent acts such as cyberattacks although we have not experienced a material security breach to date we regularly experience malicious attacks and other attempts to gain authorized access to our systems the evolving nature of threats to data security in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists statesponsored organizations and nationstates including computer viruses malware ransomware phishing misrepresentation social engineering and forgery make it increasingly challenging to anticipate and adequately mitigate these threats should they materialize 

breaches in security could expose us our supply chain our customers or other individuals to significant disruptions and a risk of public disclosure loss or misuse of this information security breaches could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information including those under the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act significant remediation costs as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and ultimately damage to our brand and reputation while we maintain insurance coverages that are intended to address certain aspects of data security such insurance may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise moreover media or other reports of perceived vulnerabilities in our network security or perceived lack of security within our environment even if inaccurate could materially adversely impact our reputation and business the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could also be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation brand business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our services include professional services managed services warranties configuration services partner services and telecom services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers we also offer certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers or such services result in an unplanned disruption of our customers’ businesses this could among other things result in legal claims and proceedings and liability for us moreover as we expand our services and solutions business and provide increasingly complex services and solutions we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory and other risks we also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation with our customers our brand and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our labor costs significantly increase or if our approach to workforce management is ineffective our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract develop engage and retain key personnel to manage lead innovate and grow our business including our key executive management sales services and technical coworkers the proposed federal vaccinate mandate along with any other vaccine requirements applicable to our coworkers and the uncertainty and unpredictability of the covid19 environment could make it more difficult to attract or retain key personnel 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of our leadership team as well as the effectiveness of our succession planning and efforts to develop and promote top talent our future success also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our customerfacing coworkers who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with many of our customers in addition as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers for whom the market is extremely competitive 

in order to attract retain and motivate key personnel in a competitive marketplace it is important to provide a competitive compensation package if our compensation package is not viewed as being competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel could be adversely affected additionally as minimum wage rates increase or related laws and regulations change we have and may need to continue to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage coworkers but also the wages paid to our other hourly or salaried coworkers 

we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market in particular with highly skilled technology specialists and engineers a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our coworker base whether caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors occurring throughout the us economy could lead to increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain coworkers and could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally if we fail to effectively manage our workforce we may need to terminate or reposition coworkers within our company to eliminate an abundance of or to reconfigure resources which could damage our coworker relations and our ability to attract and retain key personnel 

if we are unable to attract develop engage and retain key personnel or if our approach to workforce management is ineffective our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and our ability to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions could be adversely affected moreover if we are unable to continue to train our sales services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel could decrease such consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or a thirdparty provider location could damage our business 

if the warehouse and distribution equipment or operations at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster which may increase in number or severity as a result of climate change or other adverse occurrence including disruption related to political or social unrest we could utilize another distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate numerous facilities which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers and third parties such as data center colocation and hosted solution partners and thirdparties provide services as a component of our services delivery to customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of our major data storage locations or thirdparty provider locations could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

increases in the cost of commercial delivery services or disruptions of those services could materially adversely impact our business 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services including those that may result from an increase in fuel or personnel costs or a need to use higher cost delivery channels during periods of increased demand our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes inclement weather natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers or periods of increased demand on delivery services such as those we have experienced during the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our ability to deliver or receive products on a timely basis 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our sales we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced or may seek extended payment terms this risk is heightened during periods of global or industryspecific economic downturn or uncertainty during periods of rising interest rates or in the case of public sector customers during periods of budget constraints significant failures of customers to timely pay all amounts due to us could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell in addition to dropship arrangements with many of our oems and wholesale distributors we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we 

may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request or to manage supply chain interruptions if we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders and if we were unable to return the inventory to a vendor partner we would be exposed to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 

achieving the anticipated benefits of the sirius acquisition remains subject to a number of uncertainties 

on december 1 2021 the company completed its acquisition of sirius the “sirius acquisition” risks and uncertainties associated with the integration of sirius include among other things our ability to retain key personnel and maintain relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties moreover achieving the anticipated benefits of the sirius acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties including that the anticipated benefits may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected that the sirius acquisition may not be accretive to the extent anticipated and that the company’s acquisition and integration of sirius may involve unanticipated liabilities and costs failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the sirius acquisition in the expected timeframe or at all could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and common stock price 

we could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may continue to pursue transactions including strategic investments acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous business risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses there can be no assurance that the intended benefits of our investments acquisitions and alliances will be realized or that those benefits will offset these numerous risks or other unforeseen factors any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “us gaap” in connection with these types of transactions including the sirius acquisition where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets becomes impaired we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly which may result in volatility in the market price of our stock and could impact our ability to operate our business effectively 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services the introduction of new products or upgrades further if our customers’ businesses are adversely affected by the impact of covid19 they may delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating results are also highly dependent on gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including general macroeconomic conditions such as inflation pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in product and delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our reported results of operations 

our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements while our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our international subsidiaries particularly the british pound and the canadian dollar could cause material fluctuations in our reported results of operations we also have foreign currency exposure to the extent sales and purchases are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

global and regional economic and political conditions may have an adverse impact on our business 

weak or unstable economic and political conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic and political conditions government spending cuts and the impact of new government policies including the introduction of new or increased taxes the imposition of minimum taxes or new or increased limitations on deductions credits or other tax benefits or a tightening of credit markets including as a result of the covid19 pandemic could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows for example there continues to be uncertainty regarding the economic and other impacts of the uk’s exit from the european union “eu” in 2020 referred to as “brexit” potential adverse consequences of brexit and the uncertainties around the uk and eu’s relationship include global market uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates additional costs and operational burdens associated with increased operational restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and other countries potential adverse effects on the mobility of personnel and potentially increased regulatory complexities each of which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we have established a presence in the netherlands to help address future developments as needed for brexit which could add complexity to our european operations as well as result in higher costs associated with serving our customers 

the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

our business depends on the timely supply of products in order to meet the demands of our customers manufacturing interruptions or delays including as a result of the financial instability or bankruptcy of manufacturers significant labor disputes such as strikes natural disasters which may increase in number or severity as a result of climate change political or social unrest pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic or other public health crises or other adverse occurrences affecting any of our suppliers’ facilities could disrupt our supply chain we have experienced and could continue to experience product constraints due to the failure of suppliers to accurately forecast customer demand or to manufacture sufficient quantities of product to meet customer demand including as a result of shortages of product components among other reasons additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

moreover supply chain disruptions during the covid19 pandemic have caused and could continue to cause us to experience more volatility in our level of inventory and delays in completion of orders and installations for our customers 

our supply chain is also exposed to risks related to international operations while we purchase our products primarily in the markets we serve for example products for us customers are sourced in the us our vendor partners manufacture or purchase a significant portion of the products we sell outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events related to international operations that could cause disruptions to our supply chain include 

• the imposition of additional trade law provisions or regulations including the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions 

• the imposition of additional duties tariffs and other charges on imports and exports including any resulting retaliatory tariffs or charges and any reductions in the production of products subject to such tariffs and charges 

• foreign currency fluctuations and 

• restrictions on the transfer of funds 

we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell or any components of those products are purchased or manufactured will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargoes sanctions safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition our exports are subject to regulations some of which may be inconsistent and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public and private sector customers due to among other things customer spending decisions and government spending policies 

our sales are impacted by customer spending decisions on technology including refresh decisions customer initiatives that drive technology spending and customer budget priorities our sales to our public sector customers and our other customers that do business with our public sector customers in particular are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels an adverse change in government spending policies such as budget cuts or limitations or temporary shutdowns of government operations shifts in budget priorities or reductions in revenue levels could cause our impacted public sector customers or our other customers that do business with impacted public sector customers to reduce or delay their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally such adverse change in government spending policies shifts in budget priorities or reductions in revenue levels could impact cash collections from contracts with our impacted public sector customers or other customers that do business with impacted public sector customers which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

legal and regulatory risks 

the failure to comply with our public sector contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things termination fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues from our public sector customers are derived from sales to governmental entities educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services sales to public sector customers are highly regulated and present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including the false claims act the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the us or security clearance and confidentiality requirements could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public sector customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with governmental entities or other customers in the public sector in addition contracts in the public sector are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization “gpo” or upon default and public sector contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval rejections or delays which could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services furthermore our inability to enter into or retain contracts with gpos may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those gpos and compete effectively the effect of any of these possible actions or failures could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits including intellectual property infringement claims which may result in substantial costs and expenses or interruption of our normal business operations 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial employment tort and other litigation 

we are also subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services in the form of ceaseanddesist letters licensing inquiries lawsuits and other communications and demands in our industry such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased increasingly many of these assertions are brought by nonpracticing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue but we may also be subject to demands from inventors competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue lost profits andor an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities including selling certain products or services 

in addition we are subject to proceedings investigations and audits by federal state international national provincial and local authorities including as a result of our significant sales to governmental entities for example a subsidiary of the company received a civil investigative demand dated september 20 2021 from the us department of justice “doj” in connection with a false claims act investigation the doj has requested information related to teaming agreements with oems 

we also are subject to audits by various partners group purchasing organizations and customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts 

current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

failure to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations applicable to our operations or failure to meet stakeholder expectations on environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility matters could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

our global operations span a variety of legal regimes subjecting us to numerous complex diverse evolving and at times potentially inconsistent laws and regulations in a number of areas including labor and employment advertising ecommerce tax trade import and export controls economic and trade sanctions anticorruption data privacy and security requirements competition climate environmental and health and safety the evaluation of and compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and may have other adverse impacts on our business results of operations or cash flows the risk of which will be heightened as we expand the products and services we offer expand into new markets and channels and expand internationally for example we may be subject to increased costs and use of operational resources associated with complying with any new climaterelated laws and regulations additionally the hardware software and services we offer increasingly utilize new and evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence “ai” which presents risks and challenges that could result in legal liability 

we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no guarantee against coworkers contractors or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures additionally there is increased focus by stakeholders on environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility matters including climate change response packaging and waste reduction energy consumption and diversity equity and inclusion our disclosure on these matters and our failure or perceived failure to meet our commitments or otherwise effectively address these matters may erode customer trust or confidence particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation and could have a negative impact on our business 

as a public company we also are subject to increasingly complex public disclosure corporate governance and accounting requirements that increase compliance costs and require significant management focus 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business 

as of december 31 2021 we had 69 billion of total debt outstanding and 448 million of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements and the ability to borrow an additional 10 billion under our senior unsecured revolving loan facility the “revolving loan facility” our level of indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness 

• requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments on our and our subsidiaries’ debt which reduces the funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• requiring us to comply with restrictive covenants in our senior credit facilities and indentures which limit the manner in which we conduct our business 

• making it more difficult for us to obtain vendor financing from our vendor partners including original equipment manufacturers and software publishers 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the industry in which we operate 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our lessleveraged competitors 

• increasing our vulnerability to both general and industryspecific adverse economic conditions and 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing 

restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

• incur or guarantee additional debt 

• receive dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• pledge our assets as collateral 

• merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and 

• engage in sale leaseback transactions 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs a breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities the lenders 

• will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us 

• could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees to be due and payable or 

• could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings 

the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures 

if the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we may not have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness even if we were able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us 

we will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and if not successful we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control our outstanding longterm debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us and accordingly we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” included elsewhere in this report 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or revise or delay our strategic plan we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms that are favorable to us or at all that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements including our senior credit facilities and indentures in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate our debt based on a number of factors we may not be able to maintain our existing ratings and the failure to do so could increase the cost of servicing certain of our existing indebtedness and make it more difficult to raise debt financing on favorable terms in the future 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result 

• our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable 

• the lenders under our revolving loan facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and 

• we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt including secured debt this could further increase the risks associated with our leverage 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our level of indebtedness described above including our possible inability to service our debt will increase as of december 31 2021 we had 10 billion available for additional borrowing under our revolving loan facility 

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2021 we had 17 billion of variable rate debt outstanding if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate cap agreements in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective 

the london interbank offered rate “libor” is being discontinued as a floating rate benchmark which may cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences 

certain of our credit facilities including our term loan facility and our revolving loan facility have variable interest rates using libor as a benchmark rate and we have entered into interest rate cap agreements with respect to the term loan facility that are based on libor as of december 31 2021 17 billion of our total debt outstanding bears interest at variable interest rates using libor as a benchmark rate the libor and certain other interest “benchmarks” are subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates the libor administrator previously announced that all libor settings will either cease to be provided or no longer be representative i after december 31 2021 in the case of the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor tenors and all tenors of nonus dollar libor and ii after june 30 2023 in the case of the overnight and one three six and 12month us dollar libor tenors additionally the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions announced the replacement of us dollar libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by us treasury securities called the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” sofr has a limited history having been first published in april 2018 the future performance of sofr and sofrbased reference rates cannot be predicted based on sofr’s history or otherwise future levels of sofr may bear little or no relation to historical levels of sofr libor or other rates if libor ceases to exist interest rates on our current or future debt obligations and hedging instruments may be adversely affected and we may need to renegotiate the agreements governing such obligations or instruments although the agreements governing our senior credit facilities contain provisions for transition to new “benchmark” rates if libor is discontinued or cannot be determined any new “benchmark” may perform differently than libor or cause other unanticipated consequences which could adversely affect our interest expense related debt obligations and our interest rate cap agreements 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock which may be caused by a number of factors many of which we cannot control including the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and the following 

• changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock our failure to meet these estimates or failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of our common stock 

• downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock 

• future sales of our common stock by our officers directors and significant stockholders 

• market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole 

• investors’ perceptions of our prospects 

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions joint ventures or capital commitments and 

• changes in key personnel 

in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies including companies in our industry in the past securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility if we were involved in securities litigation we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business 

in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our thenoutstanding shares of our common stock and depress our stock price 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that may be considered favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors these provisions 

• authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include super voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock 

• generally prohibit stockholder action by written consent requiring all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders 

• provide that special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by or at the direction of our board of directors pursuant to a written resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of the majority of the total number of directors that the company would have if there were no vacancies 

• establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings and 

• provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws 

in addition we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15 of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage 

proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on or make share repurchases of our common stock if we do not continue to pay dividends you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price 

we expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock however any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors any determination to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions any potential indebtedness we may incur our target leverage ratio restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors our board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock if we do not pay dividends in the future realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur 

we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 

we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us the deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us

trends and key factors affecting our financial performance 

we believe the following key factors may have a meaningful impact on our business performance influencing our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted financial and operating results 

• general economic conditions are a key factor affecting our results as they impact our customers’ willingness to spend on information technology this is particularly the case for our corporate and small business customers as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects which are driven by their discrete perceptions of business and general economic conditions additionally changes in trade policy and product constraints from suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business 

• the global spread of the novel coronavirus “covid19” pandemic continues to create macroeconomic uncertainty volatility and disruption including supply constraints the supply constraints are being caused by component availability and labor and logistical disruptions resulting in extended lead times unpredictability and higher costs in 2021 customer top priorities have been digital transformation security hybrid and cloud solutions client devices and preparing for workers to return to the office and enhancing remote enablement capabilities as hybrid environments become the future work model we have orchestrated solutions by leveraging client devices accessories collaboration tools security software and hybrid and cloud offerings to help customers build these capabilities and achieve their objectives 

• changes in spending policies budget priorities and funding levels including current and future stimulus packages are key factors influencing the purchasing levels of government healthcare and education customers in 2021 education customers continued to prioritize investments towards equity and access for all students and enhancing the inclassroom and hybrid experiences in addition healthcare customers resumed projects that were paused during the pandemic as budget certainty improved as more patients returned to elective procedures government customers focused on multiyear budget planning and had contracting delays in several large contracts as the duration and ongoing economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic remain uncertain current and future budget priorities and funding levels for government healthcare and education customers may be adversely affected 

• technology trends drive customer purchasing behaviors in the market current technology trends are focused on delivering greater flexibility and efficiency as well as designing it securely these trends are driving customer adoption of solutions such as those delivered via cloud software defined architectures and hybrid onpremise and offpremise combinations as well as the evolution of the it consumption model to more “as a service” offerings including device as a service and managed services technology trends could also change as customers consider the impact of the covid19 pandemic on their operations 

key business metrics 

we monitor a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin net income nongaap operating income nongaap operating income margin nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income net sales growth on a constant currency basis net income per diluted share nongaap net income per diluted share free cash flow return on working capital cash and cash equivalents net working capital cash conversion cycle and debt levels including available credit these measures and ratios are closely monitored by management so that actions can be taken as necessary in order to achieve set standards and objectives 

in this section we discuss nongaap operating income nongaap operating income margin nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income and net sales growth on a constant currency basis which are nongaap financial measures 

we believe these measures provide analysts investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance management uses these measures to evaluate periodoverperiod performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business certain nongaap financial measures are also used to determine certain components of performancebased compensation for the definitions of nongaap operating income nongaap operating income margin nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income and net sales growth on a constant currency basis and reconciliations to the most directly comparable us gaap measure see “results of operations  nongaap financial measure reconciliations” 

the results of certain key business metrics are as follows 



1 there were 254 selling days for each of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

2 defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents 

3 cash conversion cycle is defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable and certain receivables due from vendors plus days of supply in merchandise inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable and accounts payableinventory financing based on a rolling threemonth average

selling and administrative expenses increased 119 million or 58 to 2150 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2031 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll expenses consistent with higher gross profit higher coworker count and higher performancebased compensation consistent with higher attainment against financial goals and higher acquisition and integration costs partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization and lower bad debt expense total coworker count was 13924 up 3942 from 9982 at december 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in customerfacing coworkers as a result of our recent acquisitions and an increase in new hires during 2021 

as a percentage of total net sales selling and administrative expenses decreased 70 basis points to 103 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 110 for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to lower intangible asset amortization lower bad debt expense and lower payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales

interest expense net 

interest expense net in 2021 was 151 million a decrease of 4 million compared to 155 million in 2020 this decrease was primarily driven by lower effective interest rates in 2021 compared to 2020 partially offset by additional interest expense from the 25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued on december 1 2021 the net proceeds of which were used to fund the acquisition of sirius 

other income expense net

for 2021 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes and a discrete deferred tax expense as a result of an increase in the uk corporate tax rate effective in 2023 partially offset by excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation for 2020 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes and a discrete deferred tax expense as a result of an increase in the uk corporate tax rate largely offset by excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation and tax benefits associated with global intangible low taxed income and nondeductible expenses 

the 2021 effective tax rate was higher than 2020 primarily due to certain tax benefits incurred in the prior year with no similar activity in the current year and a less favorable tax rate impact of excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation 

nongaap financial measure reconciliations 

we have included reconciliations of nongaap operating income nongaap operating income margin nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income and net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 below

seasonality 

while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year sales in our corporate segment which primarily serves us private sector business customers with more than 250 employees are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year additionally sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers since the onset of the pandemic we have experienced variability compared to historic seasonality trends as uncertainty due to covid19 remains seasonality may continue to be different than historical experience

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances historically we have not made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates as our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below for additional information related to significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

we sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of different products and services significant judgment may be required when determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together 

for contracts consisting of multiple performance obligations the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its standalone selling price judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation for certain performance obligations we will use a combination of methods to estimate the standalone selling price based on recent transactions when evidence from recent transactions is not available to confirm that the prices are representative of the standalone selling price an expected cost plus margin approach is used 

additional judgment is required in determining whether we are the principal and report revenues on a gross basis or agent and report revenues on a net basis for each identified performance obligation in a transaction we evaluate the facts and circumstances present to determine whether or not we control the specified good or service prior to transfer to the customer this evaluation includes but is not limited to assessing indicators such as whether i we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service ii we have inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer and iii we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service when the evaluation indicates we control the specified good or service prior to transfer to the customer we are acting as a principal when the evaluation indicates we do not control the specified good or service prior transfer to the customer we are acting as an agent 

the nature of our contracts give rise to variable consideration in the form of volume rebates and sales returns and allowances we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled the estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available 

we recognize revenue on performance obligations when the customer obtains control over the specified good or service that is when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the good or service for the sale of hardware and software this is generally upon delivery to the customer as a result we perform an analysis to estimate the amount of net sales intransit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been delivered to the customer this analysis requires judgment whereby we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales intransit to customers at the end of each reporting period based on a weightedaverage analysis of commercial delivery terms that include dropshipment arrangements changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days estimated to make this adjustment 

goodwill 

goodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination goodwill is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as part of our qualitative assessment judgment is required in weighing the effect of various positive and negative factors that may affect the fair value we consider various factors including the excess of fair value over carrying value from the last quantitative test macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations the projected financial performance and actual financial performance compared to prior year projected financial performance 

if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if indicators of impairment exist a quantitative impairment test is performed as part of the quantitative assessment application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur determination of our weighted average cost of capital future market conditions and profitability of future business strategies the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit however our past estimates of fair value would not have indicated an impairment when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results 

we completed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2021 we performed a qualitative analysis for all reporting units and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of all reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore did not result in an impairment in 2020 we performed a quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment and determined that no impairment existed 

business combinations 

we allocate purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities requires the use of significant estimates particularly in valuing acquired intangible assets and goodwill 

purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are initially recognized at fair value and amortized over their useful lives we determine the fair value of purchased intangible using an income approach on an individual asset basis the fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable which are categorized as a level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy the values assigned to consideration transferred assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be adjusted during the measurement period as new information arises 

we use the multiperiod excess earnings method to determine the fair value of customer relationships this method identifies the portion of revenue expected to be generated through repeat customers existing as of the valuation date and includes an attrition rate to account for the loss of customers over time critical estimates utilized in valuing customer relationships include estimated forecasted future revenue and ebitda margin growth rates customer attrition rates and marketparticipant discount rates the assumptions we apply in forecasting future revenue and customer attrition rates is based on analysis of historical data assessment of current and anticipated market conditions estimated growth rates and management plans

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks 

interest rate risk 

our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates the interest rates on borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving loan facility and our senior unsecured term loan facility are floating and therefore are subject to fluctuations in order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior unsecured term loan facility we have entered into interest rate caps to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2021 we have an interest rate cap agreement in effect with a notional amount of 13 billion for additional information see note 8 financial instruments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound and the canadian dollar which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations revenue and expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currencies of the corresponding countries the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the same as the corresponding local currency upon consolidation as results of operations are translated operating results may differ from expectations the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has not been material as the majority of our results of operations are denominated in us dollars

customers such as product constraints from our vendor partners and wholesale distributors and other disruptions to our supply chain disruptions in or restrictions on the ability of our coworkers to work effectively temporary closures of our distribution facilities modifications in the operation of facilities that remain open and disruptions of commercial delivery services the impact of covid19 and measures implemented to slow the spread have caused and could continue to cause delay in or limit the ability of our customers to make timely payments to us and could materially increase our costs in addition the pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries including the us the uk and canada during the covid19 pandemic and even after it has subsided we may experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of the pandemic’s global economic impact including any recession economic downturn or volatility government spending cuts tightening of credit markets or increased unemployment that has occurred or may occur in the future which could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices 

individually and collectively the consequences of the covid19 pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations and could also adversely impact our cash flows financial condition and liquidity the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration the severity and further spread of the outbreak future resurgences and reimplementation of closures the availability efficacy and acceptance of a vaccine and actions taken to contain the virus and the effectiveness of these actions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and be sustained the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this risk factors section 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the terms of the agreements governing those relationships 

our solutions portfolio includes products from oems software publishers and cloud providers we are authorized by these vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding including purchase rebates sales volume rebates purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows in addition a reduction in the amount or a change in the terms of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows particularly given our level of indebtedness 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we purchase the products included in our portfolio both directly from our vendor partners and from wholesale distributors although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2020 products we purchased from wholesale distributors ingram micro synnex and tech data each represented approximately 10 of total us purchases in addition sales of products manufactured by apple cisco dell emc hp inc lenovo and microsoft whether purchased directly from these vendor partners or from a wholesale distributor represented approximately 60 of our 2020 consolidated net sales sales of products manufactured by dell emc and hp inc represented approximately 25 of our 2020 consolidated net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other key vendor partners or the diminished availability of their products including due to backlogs for their products could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position 

further the sale spinoff or combination of any of our vendor partners andor certain of their business units including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell or our ability to develop relationships with and sell hardware software and services from new and emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents 

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services offerings such as cloudbased solutions including software as a service saas infrastructure as a service iaas and platform as a service paas device as a service daas the internet of things iot and artificial intelligence we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services offerings as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers also customers may delay spending while they evaluate new technologies a decrease in the rate of innovation a lack of acceptance of innovations by our customers or delays in technology spending by our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware software and services offerings for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels to the extent that a vendors offering that is in high demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels or if we are unable to develop relationships with new technology providers or companies that we have not historically represented our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 

• resellers such as computacenter connection eplus insight enterprises ntt presidio scc softchoice world wide technology and many smaller resellers 

• manufacturers who sell directly to customers such as adobe apple dell emc hp inc and hewlett packard enterprise 

• large service providers and system integrators such as accenture dell emc hewlett packard enterprise and ibm 

• communications service providers such as att centurylink and verizon 

• cloud providers such as amazon web services google and microsoft 

• etailers such as amazon and newegg and 

• retailers including their ecommerce activities such as office depot and staples 

we expect the competitive landscape to continue to evolve as new technologies and consumption models are developed such as cloudbased and other as a service solutions hyperconverged infrastructure and embedded software solutions while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for instance while cloudbased solutions present an opportunity for us cloudbased solutions and technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell in addition some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to our customers moreover traditional oems have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers if we are unable to effectively respond to the evolving competitive landscape or respond in a manner that is less effective than that of our competitors our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices

occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing maintenance and development of our information technology systems including our business systems such as our sales customer management financial and accounting marketing purchasing warehouse management ecommerce and mobile systems as well as our operational platforms including voice and data networks and power systems the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

• conduct business with our customers including delivering services and solutions to them

• purchase sell ship and invoice our hardware and software products and provide and invoice our services efficiently and on a timely basis and 

• maintain our costefficient operating model while scaling our business 

the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats both internal and external and from human error there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business or results of operations 

breaches of data security and the failure to protect our information technology systems from cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business 

our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers and others in connection with our services business some of our coworkers have access to our customers confidential data and other information additionally third parties such as data center colocation and hosted solution partners provide services to us and as a component of our services delivery to customers these third parties could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure we have privacy and data security policies practices and controls in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however as newer technologies evolve and the portfolio of the service providers we share confidential information with or from which we acquire software andor hardware for our own internal use expands as our business grows and the complexity of our business overall increases and as more business activities have shifted online due to the covid19 pandemic we could be exposed to increased risks from breaches in security including those from human error negligence or mismanagement or from illegal or fraudulent acts such as cyberattacks the evolving nature of threats to data security in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists statesponsored organizations and nationstates including computer viruses malware phishing misrepresentation social engineering and forgery make it increasingly challenging to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks 

breaches in security could expose us our supply chain our customers or other individuals to significant disruptions and a risk of public disclosure loss or misuse of this information security breaches could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation moreover media or other reports of perceived vulnerabilities in our network security or perceived lack of security within our environment even if inaccurate could materially adversely impact our reputation and business the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our services include field services managed services warranties configuration services partner services and telecom services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers we also offer 

table of contents 

certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers or such services result in an unplanned disruption of our customers businesses this could among other things result in legal claims and proceedings and liability for us moreover as we expand our services and solutions business and provide increasingly complex services and solutions we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory and other risks we also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation with our customers our brand and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract develop engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business including our key executive management sales services and technical coworkers 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of our chief executive officer as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers and the effectiveness of our succession planning our future success also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our customerfacing coworkers who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with many of our customers in addition as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers for whom the market is extremely competitive 

if we are unable to attract develop engage and retain key personnel our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and our ability to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions could be adversely affected moreover if we are unable to continue to train our sales services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel could decrease such consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or a thirdparty provider location could damage our business 

we have two warehouse and distribution facilities in the us and one in the uk if the warehouse and distribution equipment or operations at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence including disruption related to political or social unrest we could utilize another distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate numerous facilities which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers and third parties such as data center colocation and hosted solution partners provide services as a component of our services delivery to customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of our major sales offices or thirdparty provider locations could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

increases in the cost of commercial delivery services or disruptions of those services could materially adversely impact our business 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services including those that may result from an increase in fuel or personnel costs or a need to use higher cost delivery channels during periods of increased demand our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes inclement weather natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers or periods of increased demand on delivery services could materially adversely affect our ability to deliver or receive products on a timely basis 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our sales typically on 30day payment terms we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced or may seek extended payment terms this risk is heightened during periods of global or industryspecific economic downturn or uncertainty during periods of rising interest rates or in the case of public sector customers during periods of budget constraints significant failures of customers to timely pay all amounts due to us could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request or to manage supply chain interruptions if we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders and if we were unable to return the inventory to a vendor partner we would be exposed to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 

we could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may continue to pursue transactions including strategic investments acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous business risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses there can be no assurance that the intended benefits of our investments acquisitions and alliances will be realized or that those benefits will offset these numerous risks or other unforeseen factors any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets becomes impaired we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly which may result in volatility in the market price of our stock and could impact our ability to operate our business effectively 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades further if our customers’ businesses are adversely affected by the impact of covid19 they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including general macroeconomic conditions pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our reported results of operations 

our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements while our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our international subsidiaries particularly the british pound and the canadian dollar could cause material fluctuations in our reported results of operations we also have foreign currency exposure to the extent sales and purchases are not denominated in a subsidiarys functional currency which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows

macroeconomic and industry risks 

global and regional economic and political conditions may have an adverse impact on our business 

weak economic conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic and political conditions government spending cuts and the impact of new government policies including the introduction of new or increased taxes or a tightening of credit markets including as a result of the covid19 pandemic could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows for example there continues to be uncertainty regarding the economic and other impacts of the uks phased exit from the european union eu in 2020 referred to as brexit an agreement was reached between the uk and the eu in relation to their future relationship in certain areas which included a new trade and cooperation agreement relating principally to the free trade in goods the euuk trade and cooperation agreement while the euuk trade and cooperation agreement provides clarity in respect of the free trade in goods between the uk and the eu there remain uncertainties related to the stability and effects of the new relationship potential adverse consequences of brexit and the uncertainties around euuk trade and cooperation agreement include global market uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates additional costs and operational burdens associated with increased operational restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and other countries and potentially increased regulatory complexities each of which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations we have established a presence in the netherlands to help address future developments as needed for brexit which could add complexity to our european operations as well as result in higher costs associated with serving our customers 

the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

our business depends on the timely supply of products in order to meet the demands of our customers manufacturing interruptions or delays including as a result of the financial instability or bankruptcy of manufacturers significant labor disputes such as strikes natural disasters political or social unrest pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic or other public health crises or other adverse occurrences affecting any of our suppliers facilities could disrupt our supply chain we could experience product constraints due to the failure of suppliers to accurately forecast customer demand or to manufacture sufficient quantities of product to meet customer demand including as a result of shortages of product components among other reasons additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our supply chain is also exposed to risks related to international operations while we purchase our products primarily in the markets we serve for example products for us customers are sourced in the us our vendor partners manufacture or purchase a significant portion of the products we sell outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events related to international operations that could cause disruptions to our supply chain include 

• the imposition of additional trade law provisions or regulations including the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions 

• the imposition of additional duties tariffs and other charges on imports and exports including any resulting retaliatory tariffs or charges and any reductions in the production of products subject to such tariffs and charges 

• foreign currency fluctuations and 

• restrictions on the transfer of funds 

we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell or any components of those products are purchased or manufactured will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargoes sanctions safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition our exports are subject to regulations some of which may be inconsistent and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public sector customers 

our sales to our public sector customers and our other customers that do business with our public sector customers are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels an adverse change in government spending policies such as budget cuts or limitations or temporary shutdowns of government operations shifts in budget priorities or reductions in revenue levels could cause our impacted public sector customers or our other customers that do business with impacted public sector customers to reduce or delay their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally such adverse change in government spending policies shifts in budget priorities or reductions in revenue levels could impact cash collections from contracts with our impacted public sector customers or other customers that do business with impacted public sector customers which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

legal and regulatory risks 

the failure to comply with our public sector contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things termination fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues from our public sector customers are derived from sales to governmental entities educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services sales to public sector customers are highly regulated noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including the false claims act the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the us or security clearance and confidentiality requirements could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public sector customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with governmental entities or other customers in the public sector in addition contracts in the public sector are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization gpo or upon default furthermore our inability to enter into or retain contracts with gpos may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those gpos and compete effectively the effect of any of these possible actions or failures could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits which may result in substantial costs and expenses or interruption of our normal business operations 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial employment tort and other litigation 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services in the form of ceaseanddesist letters licensing inquiries lawsuits and other communications and demands in our industry such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased increasingly many of these assertions are brought by nonpracticing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue but we may also be subject to demands from inventors competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue lost profits andor an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities including selling certain products or services 

we also are subject to proceedings investigations and audits by federal state international national provincial and local authorities including as a result of our significant sales to governmental entities we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various programs and contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts 

current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents 

failure to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

in light of the global nature of our business our operations are subject to numerous complex federal state provincial local and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas including labor and employment advertising ecommerce tax trade import and export requirements economic and trade sanctions anticorruption data privacy requirements including those under the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act anticompetition environmental and health and safety the evaluation of and compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and these laws and regulations may have other adverse impacts on our business results of operations or cash flows furthermore these laws and regulations are evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business and the risk of noncompliance 

we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no guarantee against coworkers contractors or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures 

as a public company we also are subject to increasingly complex public disclosure corporate governance and accounting requirements that increase compliance costs and require significant management focus 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business 

as of december 31 2020 we had 39 billion of total longterm debt outstanding and 525 million of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements and the ability to borrow an additional 10 billion under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit loan facility the revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations and an additional £50 million 68 million under our cdw uk revolving credit facility our level of indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness 

• requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments on our and our subsidiaries debt which reduces the funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• requiring us to comply with restrictive covenants in our senior credit facilities and indentures which limit the manner in which we conduct our business 

• making it more difficult for us to obtain vendor financing from our vendor partners including original equipment manufacturers and software publishers 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the industry in which we operate 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our lessleveraged competitors 

• increasing our vulnerability to both general and industryspecific adverse economic conditions and 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing 

restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

• incur or guarantee additional debt 

• pay dividends or make distributions to holders of our capital stock or to make certain other restricted payments or investments 

• repurchase or redeem capital stock 

• make loans capital expenditures or investments or acquisitions 

table of contents 

• receive dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• pledge our assets as collateral 

• merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 

• transfer or sell assets including capital stock of subsidiaries and 

• prepay repurchase or redeem debt 

as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs a breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities the lenders 

• will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us 

• could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees to be due and payable or 

• could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings 

the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures 

if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior credit facilities if the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness even if we were able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us 

in addition under our revolving loan we are permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of up to 15 billion however our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition the borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors eligible accounts receivable net of accounts receivable reserves up to 30 of such eligible accounts receivable which can consist of federal government accounts receivable plus the lesser of i 75 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves and ii the product of 85 multiplied by the net orderly liquidation value percentage multiplied by eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves less reserves other than accounts reserves and inventory reserves the borrowing base in effect as of december 31 2020 was 22 billion and therefore did not restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving loan as of that date 

our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is also limited by a minimum liquidity condition which provides that if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of i 125 million and ii the greater of a 10 of the borrowing base and b 100 million the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under our revolving loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving loan is at least 100 to 100 it is an event of default under our revolving loan if our excess cash availability and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio remain below such levels for a period of five or more consecutive business days moreover our revolving loan provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability reserves which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us we cannot make any assurances that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or were it to do so that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity 

we will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and if not successful we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control our outstanding longterm debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us and accordingly we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or revise or delay our strategic plan we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms that are favorable to us or at all that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements including our senior credit facilities and indentures in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations our senior credit facilities restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result 

• our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable 

• the lenders under our senior credit facilities could foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings from them and the lenders under our revolving loan and cdw uk revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and 

• we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt including secured debt this could further increase the risks associated with our leverage 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our level of indebtedness described above including our possible inability to service our debt will increase as of december 31 2020 we had 10 billion available for additional borrowing under our revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations and an additional £50 million 68 million available under our cdw uk revolving credit facility 

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2020 we had 15 billion of variable rate debt outstanding if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate cap agreements in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective 

the london interbank offered rate libor and certain other interest benchmarks may be subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences 

certain of our credit facilities including our senior secured term loan facility and our revolving loan have variable interest rates using libor as a benchmark rate and we have entered into interest rate cap agreements with respect to the senior secured term loan facility that are based on libor as of december 31 2020 15 billion of our total debt outstanding bears interest at variable interest rates using libor as a benchmark rate the libor and certain other interest benchmarks may be subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates the libor administrator previously announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021 however for us dollar libor it now appears that the relevant date may be deferred to june 30 2023 for the most common tenors overnight and one three six and 12 months as to those tenors the libor administrator has published a consultation regarding its intention to cease publication of us dollar libor as of june 30 2023 instead of december 31 2021 as previously expected moreover the libor administrator’s consultation also relates to the libor administrator’s intention to cease publication of nonus dollar libor after 2021 although the foregoing may provide some sense of timing there is no assurance that libor of any particular currency or tenor will continue to be published until any

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock which may be caused by a number of factors many of which we cannot control including the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and the following 

• changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock our failure to meet these estimates or failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of our common stock 

• downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock 

• future sales of our common stock by our officers directors and significant stockholders 

• market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole 

• investors perceptions of our prospects 

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions joint ventures or capital commitments and 

• changes in key personnel 

in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies including companies in our industry in the past securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility if we were involved in securities litigation we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business 

in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our thenoutstanding shares of our common stock and depress our stock price 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that may be considered favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors these provisions 

• authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and which may include super voting special approval dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock 

• generally prohibit stockholder action by written consent requiring all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders 

table of contents 

• provide that special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by or at the direction of our board of directors pursuant to a written resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of the majority of the total number of directors that the company would have if there were no vacancies 

• establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings and 

• provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15 of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on or make share repurchases of our common stock if we do not continue to pay dividends you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price 

we expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock however any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors any determination to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions any potential indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors our board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock if we do not pay dividends in the future realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur 

we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 

we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us the deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us

trends and key factors affecting our financial performance 

we believe the following key factors may have a meaningful impact on our business performance influencing our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted financial and operating results 

• general economic conditions are a key factor affecting our results as they impact our customers willingness to spend on information technology this is particularly the case for our corporate and small business customers as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects which are driven by their discrete perceptions of business and general economic conditions additionally changes in trade policy and product constraints from suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business 

table of contents 

• the global spread of the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic continues to create significant macroeconomic uncertainty volatility and disruption the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration severity and further spread of the outbreak future resurgences and reimplementation of closures the availability efficacy and acceptance of a vaccine and the actions taken to contain the virus and the effectiveness of these actions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and be sustained we have mobilized our resources to help ensure the wellbeing and safety of our coworkers business continuity a strong capital position and adequate liquidity our efforts have included 

• continued focus on the wellbeing and safety of our coworkers leveraging standing crisis management protocols and following guidelines from public health authorities and state and local governments during 2020 we implemented precautions to help keep our coworkers healthy and safe including activating a crossfunctional response team led by senior leadership moving to remote work for our office coworkers and implementing safety protocols at our distribution centers including social distancing measures segmented shifts additional personal protective equipment enhanced facility cleanings and temperature screening for anyone entering the facilities all distribution and configuration centers are considered essential businesses and continue to be operational our office coworkers continue to work remotely 

• remote enablement operations continuity and security are customer focus areas to manage remote environments at scale and to prepare to be remote longer customers are focused on initiatives to reduce costs optimize resources and leverage technology for better customer and employee experiences through digital transformation we have orchestrated solutions by leveraging client devices accessories collaboration tools security software and hybrid and cloud offerings to help customers build these capabilities and achieve their objectives 

• increasing our provision for credit losses during the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of the expected economic impact of the covid19 pandemic we continue to monitor cash collections and credit limits of our customers to manage the risk of uncollectible receivables 

• closely monitoring our cost structure and liquidity position relative to the overall demand environment we took measures to enhance liquidity including completing a 600 million senior notes issuance in april 2020 leveraging the lower interest rate environment by refinancing one of our higher interest rate senior notes in august 2020 implementing cost savings initiatives and suspending temporarily share repurchases from march 2020 through october 2020 

• changes in spending policies budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing the purchasing levels of government healthcare and education customers given the covid19 pandemic education customers have prioritized their budgets towards it spending while healthcare customer budgets have been pressured as the duration and ongoing economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic remain uncertain current and future budget priorities and funding levels for government healthcare and education customers may be adversely affected 

• technology trends drive customer purchasing behaviors in the market current technology trends are focused on delivering greater flexibility and efficiency as well as designing it securely these trends are driving customer adoption of solutions such as those delivered via cloud software defined architectures and hybrid onpremise and offpremise combinations as well as the evolution of the it consumption model to more as a service offerings including device as a service and managed services technology trends could also change as customers consider the impact of the covid19 pandemic on their operations 

• the new ukeuropean union eu trade deal due to the uk’s exit from the eu referred to as brexit that came into effect on january 1 2021 eased concerns over restrictions of imports and exports but it increased regulatory complexities that may adversely impact our business 

key business metrics 

we monitor a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin net income nongaap operating income nongaap operating income margin nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income net sales growth on a constant currency basis net income per diluted share nongaap net income per diluted share free cash flow return on working capital cash and cash equivalents net working capital cash conversion cycle debt levels including available credit sales per coworker and coworker

selling and administrative expenses increased 125 million or 65 to 2031 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 1906 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll expenses consistent with higher gross profit higher average coworker count and coworker compensation investments and a higher provision for credit losses driven by increased reserves reflecting the expected economic impact of the covid19 pandemic the increase was partially offset by cost saving measures including decreased travel and entertainment total coworker count was 9982 up 86 from 9896 at december 31 2019 due to our recent acquisition 

as a percentage of total net sales selling and administrative expenses increased 40 basis points to 110 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 106 for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to higher payroll expenses and a higher provision for credit losses partially offset by lower travel and entertainment

interest expense net 

interest expense net in 2020 was 155 million a decrease of 4 million compared to 159 million in 2019 this decrease was primarily due to paying a lower effective interest rate on the term loan in 2020 compared to the capped rate in 2019 partially offset by additional interest expense on the senior notes issued in april 2020

seasonality 

while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year sales in our corporate segment which primarily serves us private sector business customers with more than 250 employees are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year additionally sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers during 2020 we experienced variability compared to historic seasonality trends as uncertainty due to covid19 remains seasonality is expected to continue to be different than historical experience

4 the change is due to lower customerdriven and strategic stocking positions partially offset by timing of receipts and shipments 

5 the change is primarily due to mixing into vendors with extended payment terms in 2021 increased sales and yearend inventory purchases

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 130 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease was primarily due to decreased capital expenditures of 78 million from fewer purchases of devices for the census program and lower investments in acquisitions 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities increased 889 million in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 the increase was primarily driven by the 600 million debt offering completed in april 2020 lower share repurchases and increased volume through our inventory financing arrangements partially offset by decreased borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and higher dividend payments for additional information regarding our debt activities see note 10 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances historically we have not made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates as our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below for additional information related to significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of different products and services significant judgment may be required when determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together 

for contracts consisting of multiple performance obligations the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its standalone selling price judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation for certain performance obligations we will use a combination of methods to estimate the standalone selling price based on recent transactions when evidence from recent transactions is not available to confirm that the prices are representative of the standalone selling price an expected cost plus margin approach is used 

additional judgment is required in determining whether we are the principal and report revenues on a gross basis or agent and report revenues on a net basis for each identified performance obligation in a transaction we evaluate the facts and circumstances present to determine whether or not we control the specified good or service prior to transfer to the customer this evaluation includes but is not limited to assessing indicators such as whether i we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service ii we have inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer and iii we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service when the evaluation indicates we control the specified good or service prior to transfer to the customer we are acting as a principal when the evaluation indicates we do not control the specified good or service prior transfer to the customer we are acting as an agent 

the nature of our contracts give rise to variable consideration in the fo rm of volume rebates and sales returns and allowances we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled the estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transactio n price are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available 

we recognize revenue on performance obligations when the customer obtains control over the specified good or service that is when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the good or service for the sale of hardware and software this is generally upon delivery to the customer as a result we perform an analysis to 

table of contents 

estimate the amount of net sales intransit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been delivered to the customer this analysis requires judgment whereby we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales intransit to customers at the end of each reporting period based on a weightedaverage analysis of commercial delivery terms that include dropshipment arrangements changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days estimated to make this adjustment 

vendor programs 

we receive incentives from certain vendors related to cooperative advertising volume rebates bid programs price protection and other programs these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or merchandise inventory depending on the nature of the incentive we record vendor partner receivables related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets 

we also record reserves for vendor partner receivables for estimated losses due to vendors inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims in estimating the required allowance we take into consideration collections performance and the aging of the incentive receivables as well as specific vendor circumstances 

goodwill 

goodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis each december 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as part of our qualitative assessment judgment is required in weighing the effect of various positive and negative factors that may affect the fair value we consider various factors including the excess of fair value over carrying value from the last quantitative test macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations the projected financial performance and actual financial performance compared to prior year projected financial performance 

if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if indicators of impairment exist a quantitative impairment test is performed as part of the quantitative assessment application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur determination of our weighted average cost of capital future market conditions and profitability of future business strategies the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit however our past estimates of fair value would not have indicated an impairment when revised to include subsequent years  actual results 

intangible assets 

intangible assets include customer relationships trade names internally developed software and other intangibles intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset and reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgment and the use of estimates the valuation classification and assignment of useful lives are derived using market inputs historic experience and thirdparty guidance 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes and evaluating our tax positions requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions our annual 

table of contents 

effective tax rate is based on our income the jurisdictions in which the income is earned and subjected to taxation the tax laws in those various jurisdictions which can be affected by tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items and accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances 

we establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following 1 the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained 2 the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but for a lesser amount or 3 the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken reserves related to tax accruals and valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law in the relevant jurisdictions and our future taxable income levels in the relevant jurisdictions with respect to valuation allowances 

allowance for credit losses 

we estimate an allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable for future expected credit losses by using relevant information such as historical information current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the allowance is measured on a pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist and a lossrate for each pool is determined using historical credit loss experience as the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information involves making informed judgments to reflect our expectations for differences in current conditions as well as changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions such as changes in the unemployment rate or gross domestic product growth when applicable we also consider internal information on pool specific factors to inform our decision making we typically observe a higher lossrate experience with customers in the pools associated with our corporate and small business segments as compared to the pools associated with the public segment during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized an increase in the allowance to reflect the forecasted credit deterioration due to the covid19 pandemic which considered geographicspecific factors customer makeup and the overall size of our pools as well as the impacts experienced to date and the impacts from the last significant economic downturn in 20082009 as the overall impact and duration of the covid19 pandemic remains uncertain our estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks 

interest rate risk 

our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates the interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility our senior secured term loan facility and the cdw uk term loan are floating and therefore are subject to fluctuations in order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility we have entered into interest rate caps to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations

see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations for information on cash flows interest rates and maturity dates of our debt obligations 

foreign currency risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound and the canadian dollar which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations revenue and expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currencies of the corresponding countries the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the same as the corresponding local currency upon consolidation as results of operations are translated operating results may differ from expectations the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has not been material as the majority of our results of operations are denominated in us dollars

for our us operations we purchased approximately 50 of the products we sold as discrete products or as components of a solution directly from our vendor partners and the remaining 50 from wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2019  purchases from our three largest wholesale distributors ingram micro synnex and tech data were each approximately 10 of total us purchases in 2019

we believe that the location of our distribution centers allows us to efficiently ship products to our customers and provide timely access to our principal distributors 

we believe competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of the product categories that we offer 

competition 

the market for technology products and services is highly competitive and subject to economic conditions and rapid technological changes competition is based on many things including the ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs the quality and breadth of product and service offerings knowledge and expertise of sales force customer service price product availability speed of delivery and credit availability we face competition from resellers direct manufacturers large service providers cloud providers telecommunication companies and to a lesser extent etailers and retailers smaller local or regional valueadded resellers typically focus on a single solution suite or portfolio of solutions from one or two vendor partners 

we believe we are well positioned to compete within this marketplace due to our competitive advantages we expect the competitive landscape to continue to evolve as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for additional information on the risks associated with competition see item 1a risk factors

our offerings 

our offerings range from discrete hardware and software products and services to complex integrated solutions including one or more of these elements we believe our customers increasingly view technology purchases as integrated solutions rather than discrete product and service categories we estimate that more than 40 of our net sales in 2019 in the us came from sales of product categories and services typically associated with solutions our hardware products include notebooksmobile devices including tablets network communications desktop computers video monitors enterprise and data storage and other hardware our software products include application suites security virtualization operating systems and network management our services include warranties managed services consulting design and implementation

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some important factors that may cause our business prospects results of operations and cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our business 

global and regional economic and political conditions may have an adverse impact on our business 

weak economic conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic and political conditions government spending cuts and the impact of new government policies or a tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows for example there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the economic impact of the uks exit from the european union eu referred to as brexit the uk formally withdrew from eu membership on january 31 2020 and commenced a transition period during which the trading relationship between the uk and the eu will remain the same and the uk and eu will begin negotiations to determine their future relationship although the full effects of brexit are uncertain and will be dependent on the outcome of such negotiations potential adverse consequences of brexit include global market uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and other countries and increased regulatory complexities each of which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations these effects may be amplified if the uk and the eu fail to agree on a future trade relationship which could result in significant market and economic disruption we have established a presence in the netherlands to help address future developments as needed for brexit which could add complexity to our european operations as well as result in higher costs associated with serving our customers following the transition period 

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public sector customers 

our sales to our public sector customers and our other customers that do business with our public sector customers are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels an adverse change in government spending policies such as budget cuts or limitations or temporary shutdowns of government operations shifts in budget priorities or reductions in revenue levels could cause our impacted public sector customers or our other customers that do business with impacted public sector customers to reduce or delay their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally such adverse change in government spending policies shifts in budget priorities or reductions in revenue levels could impact cash collections from contracts with our impacted public sector customers or other customers that do business with impacted public sector customers which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the terms of the agreements governing those relationships 

our solutions portfolio includes products from oems software publishers and cloud providers we are authorized by these vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding including purchase rebates sales volume rebates purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows in addition a reduction in the amount or a change in the terms of credit granted to us by our vendor 

partners could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows particularly given our level of indebtedness 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we purchase the products included in our portfolio both directly from our vendor partners and from wholesale distributors although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2019  products we purchased from wholesale distributors ingram micro synnex and tech data each represented approximately 10 of total us purchases in addition sales of products manufactured by apple cisco dell emc hp inc lenovo and microsoft whether purchased directly from these vendor partners or from a wholesale distributor represented approximately 60 of our 2019 consolidated net sales sales of products manufactured by cisco and dell emc represented approximately 25 of our 2019 consolidated net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other key vendor partners or the diminished availability of their products including due to backlogs for their products could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position 

further the sale spinoff or combination of any of our vendor partners andor certain of their business units including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell or our ability to develop relationships with and sell hardware software and services from new and emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services offerings such as cloudbased solutions including software as a service saas infrastructure as a service iaas and platform as a service paas device as a service daas the internet of things iot and artificial intelligence we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services offerings as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers also customers may delay spending while they evaluate new technologies a decrease in the rate of innovation a lack of acceptance of innovations by our customers or delays in technology spending by our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware software and services offerings for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels to the extent that a vendors offering that is in high demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels or if we are unable to develop relationships with new technology providers or companies that we have not historically represented our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 



 we expect the competitive landscape to continue to evolve as new technologies and consumption models are developed such as cloudbased and other as a service solutions hyperconverged infrastructure and embedded software solutions while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for instance while cloudbased solutions present an opportunity for us cloudbased solutions and technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell in addition some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to our customers moreover traditional oems have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers if we are unable to effectively respond to the evolving competitive landscape or respond in a manner that is less effective than that of our competitors our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

our business depends on the timely supply of products in order to meet the demands of our customers manufacturing interruptions or delays including as a result of the financial instability or bankruptcy of manufacturers significant labor disputes such as strikes natural disasters pandemics or other public health crises such as the coronavirus or other adverse occurrences affecting any of our suppliers facilities could disrupt our supply chain we could experience product constraints due to the failure of suppliers to accurately forecast customer demand or to manufacture sufficient quantities of product to meet customer demand amongst other reasons additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our supply chain is also exposed to risks related to international operations while we purchase our products primarily in the markets we serve for example products for us customers are sourced in the us our vendor partners manufacture or purchase a significant portion of the products we sell outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events related to international operations that could cause disruptions to our supply chain include 

 we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell or any components of those products are purchased or manufactured will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargoes sanctions safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition our exports are subject to regulations some of which may be inconsistent and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing maintenance and development of our information technology systems including our business systems such as our sales customer management financial and accounting marketing 

purchasing warehouse management ecommerce and mobile systems as well as our operational platforms including voice and data networks and power systems the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

 the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats both internal and external and from human error there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business or results of operations 

breaches of data security and the failure to protect our information technology systems from cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business 

our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers and others in connection with our services business some of our coworkers have access to our customers confidential data and other information additionally third parties such as data center colocation and hosted solution partners provide services to us and as a component of our services delivery to customers these third parties could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure we have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however as newer technologies evolve and the portfolio of the service providers we share confidential information with grows we could be exposed to increased risks from breaches in security including those from human error negligence or mismanagement or from illegal or fraudulent acts such as cyberattacks the evolving nature of threats to data security in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists statesponsored organizations and nationstates including computer viruses malware phishing misrepresentation social engineering and forgery make it increasingly challenging to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks 

breaches in security could expose us our supply chain our customers or other individuals to significant disruptions a risk of public disclosure loss or misuse of this information security breaches could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation moreover media or other reports of perceived vulnerabilities in our network security or perceived lack of security within our environment even if inaccurate could adversely impact our reputation and materially impact our business the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the failure to comply with our public sector contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things termination fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues from our public sector customers are derived from sales to governmental entities educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services sales to public sector customers are highly regulated noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including the false claims act the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the us or security clearance and confidentiality requirements could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public sector customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with governmental entities or other customers in the public sector in addition contracts in the public sector are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization gpo or upon default furthermore our inability to enter into or retain contracts with gpos may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those gpos and compete effectively the effect of any of these possible actions or failures could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption 

of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our services include field services managed services warranties configuration services partner services and telecom services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers we also offer certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers businesses this could among other things result in legal claims and proceedings and liability for us moreover as we expand our services and solutions business and provide increasingly complex services and solutions we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory and other risks we also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation with our customers our brand and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract develop engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business including our key executive management sales services and technical coworkers 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of our chief executive officer as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers and the effectiveness of our succession planning our future success also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our customerfacing coworkers who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with many of our customers in addition as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers for whom the market is extremely competitive 

if we are unable to attract develop engage and retain key personnel our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and our ability to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions could be adversely affected moreover if we are unable to continue to train our sales services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel could decrease such consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or a thirdparty provider location could damage our business 

we have two warehouse and distribution facilities in the us and one in the uk if the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence we could utilize another distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate numerous facilities which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers and third parties such as data center colocation and hosted solution partners provide services as a component of our services delivery to customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of our major sales offices or thirdparty provider locations could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

increases in the cost of commercial delivery services or disruptions of those services could materially adversely impact our business 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services including those that may result from an increase in fuel or personnel costs our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes inclement weather natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers could materially adversely affect our ability to deliver or receive products on a timely basis 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales typically on 30day payment terms we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced this risk is heightened during periods of global or industryspecific economic downturn or uncertainty during periods 

of rising interest rates or in the case of public sector customers during periods of budget constraints significant failures of customers to timely pay all amounts due to us could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request or to manage supply chain interruptions if we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders we would be exposed to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 

we could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may continue to pursue transactions including strategic investments acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous business risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses there can be no assurance that the intended benefits of our investments acquisitions and alliances will be realized or that those benefits will offset these numerous risks or other unforeseen factors any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets becomes impaired we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly which may result in volatility in the market price of our stock and could impact our ability to operate our business effectively 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades further if our customers’ businesses are adversely affected by the impact of the coronavirus they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including general macroeconomic conditions pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our reported results of operations 

our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements while our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our international subsidiaries particularly the british pound and the canadian dollar could cause material fluctuations in our reported results of operations we also have foreign currency exposure to the extent sales and purchases are not denominated in a subsidiarys functional currency which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits which may result in substantial costs and expenses or interruption of our normal business operations 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial employment tort and other litigation 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services in the form of ceaseanddesist letters licensing inquiries lawsuits and other communications and demands in our industry such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased increasingly many of these assertions are brought by nonpracticing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue but we may also be subject to demands from inventors competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue lost profits andor an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities including selling certain products or services 

we also are subject to proceedings investigations and audits by federal state international national provincial and local authorities including as a result of our significant sales to governmental entities we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts 

current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

failure to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to numerous complex federal state provincial local and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas including labor and employment advertising ecommerce tax trade import and export requirements economic and trade sanctions anticorruption data privacy requirements including those under the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act anticompetition environmental and health and safety the evaluation of and compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and these laws and regulations may have other adverse impacts on our business results of operations or cash flows furthermore these laws and regulations are evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business and the risk of noncompliance 

we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no guarantee against coworkers contractors or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures 

as a public company we also are subject to increasingly complex public disclosure corporate governance and accounting requirements that increase compliance costs and require significant management focus 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business 

as of december 31 2019  we had 33 billion of total longterm debt outstanding and 430 million of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements and the ability to borrow an additional 10 billion under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit loan facility the revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations and an additional £ 50 million  66 million at december 31 2019  under our cdw uk revolving credit facility our level of indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 



 restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs a breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities the lenders 

 the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures 

if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior credit facilities if the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness even if we were able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us 

in addition under our revolving loan we are permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of up to 15 billion  however our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition the borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors eligible accounts receivable net of accounts receivable 

reserves up to 30 of such eligible accounts receivable which can consist of federal government accounts receivable plus the lesser of i 75 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves and ii the product of 85 multiplied by the net orderly liquidation value percentage multiplied by eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves less reserves other than accounts reserves and inventory reserves the borrowing base in effect as of december 31 2019 was 20 billion and therefore did not restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving loan as of that date 

our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is also limited by a minimum liquidity condition which provides that if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of i 125 million and ii the greater of a 10 of the borrowing base and b 100 million the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under our revolving loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving loan is at least 100 to 100 it is an event of default under our revolving loan if our excess cash availability and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio remain below such levels for a period of five or more consecutive business days moreover our revolving loan provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability reserves which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us we cannot make any assurances that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or were it to do so that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity 

we will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and if not successful we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control our outstanding longterm debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us and accordingly we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources included elsewhere in this report 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or revise or delay our strategic plan we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms that are favorable to us or at all that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements including our senior credit facilities and indentures in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations our senior credit facilities restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result 

 we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt including secured debt this could further increase the risks associated with our leverage 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our level of indebtedness described above including our possible inability to service our debt will increase as of december 31 2019  we had 10 billion available for additional borrowing under our revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations and an additional £ 50 million  66 million at december 31 2019  available under our cdw uk revolving credit facility 

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2019  we had 16 billion of variable rate debt outstanding if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate cap agreements in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective 

the london interbank offered rate libor and certain other interest benchmarks may be subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences 

certain of our credit facilities including our senior secured term loan facility and our revolving loan have variable interest rates using libor as a benchmark rate and we have entered into interest rate cap agreements with respect to the senior secured term loan facility that are based on libor as of december 31 2019 15 billion of our total debt outstanding bears interest at variable interest rates using libor as a benchmark rate the libor and certain other interest benchmarks may be subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions announced the replacement of us dollar libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by us treasury securities called the secured overnight financing rate sofr the first publication of sofr was released in april 2018 whether or not sofr attains market traction as a libor replacement for us dollardenominated instruments and whether other benchmarks will attain traction in other markets remains in question and the future of libor at this time is uncertain if libor ceases to exist interest rates on our current or future debt obligations and hedging instruments may be adversely affected and we may need to renegotiate the agreements governing such obligations or instruments although the agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility contains provisions for amending the applicable term loan interest rates if libor is discontinued or cannot be determined any such amendments will be contingent on our ability to negotiate new benchmark rates spreads and calculation methods with the administrative agent and lenders under such facility we may be unable to negotiate an acceptable alternative to libor or if we do agree to amend the facility the new benchmark may perform differently than libor or cause other unanticipated consequences which could adversely affect our interest expense related debt obligations and our interest rate cap agreements 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock which may be caused by a number of factors many of which we cannot control including the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and the following 



in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies including companies in our industry in the past securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility if we were involved in securities litigation we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business 

in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our thenoutstanding shares of our common stock and depress our stock price 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that may be considered favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors these provisions 

 our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15 of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on or make share repurchases of our common stock if we do not continue to pay dividends you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price 

we expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock currently at the rate of 0380 per share per quarter or 152 per share per annum however any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors any determination to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions any potential indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors our board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock if we do not pay dividends in the future realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur 

we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 

we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us the deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us

we anticipate no difficulty in retaining occupancy through lease renewals monthtomonth occupancy or replacing the leased properties with equivalent properties we believe that suitable additional or substitute leased properties will be available as required 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial intellectual property employment tort and other litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state international national provincial and local authorities and by various partners group purchasing organizations and customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the us in such cases certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

as of december 31 2019  we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters if any has been incurred however the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable as such our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters

trends and key factors affecting our financial performance 

we believe the following key factors may have a meaningful impact on our business performance influencing our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted financial and operating results 



brexit we have established a presence in the netherlands to support cdw uks broader growth opportunities in the eu and to help address future developments as needed for brexit 



key business metrics 

we monitor a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary effective january 1 2019 we made a change to the nongaap financial measures that we use to provide meaningful methods of evaluating our financial performance and have replaced ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin with nongaap operating income and nongaap operating income margin we made this change due to the continuing evolution of the it consumption model we believe nongaap operating income will be more reflective of the costs of providing services to our customers and our own costs as the consumption model continues to evolve nongaap operating income is also being used for the first time in 2019 as a key business metric for our annual incentive compensation programs 

in addition to nongaap operating income and nongaap operating income margin we believe that the most important financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin net income nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income net income per diluted share nongaap net income per diluted share free cash flow return on working capital cash and cash equivalents net working capital cash conversion cycle debt levels including available credit sales per coworker and coworker turnover these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management so that actions can be taken as necessary in order to achieve the standards and objectives 

in this report we discuss nongaap operating income nongaap operating income margin nongaap income before income taxes and nongaap net income which are nongaap financial measures 

we believe these measures provide analysts investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance management uses these measures to evaluate periodoverperiod performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business for the definitions of nongaap operating income nongaap operating income margin nongaap income before income taxes and nongaap net income and reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measure see results of operations  nongaap financial measure reconciliations 

the results of certain key business metrics are as follows 







results of operations 

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net sales are as follows 



net sales 

net sales by segment in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales are as follows 



 total net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 1792 million  or 110  to 18032 million  compared to the prior year excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations constant currency net sales growth was 115  for additional information see nongaap financial measure reconciliations below regarding constant currency net sales growth 

for the year ended december 31 2019  net sales growth reflected growth across all major product categories particularly client devices defined as notebooksmobile devices and desktops software and services additionally eleven months of results from scalar which was acquired on february 1 2019 contributed to our net sales growth for additional information see note 17 segment information to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

corporate segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 657 million  or 96  compared to the year ended december 31 2018  growth was primarily driven by client devices and software 

small business segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 increased by 151 million  or 111  compared to the year ended december 31 2018  growth was primarily driven by client devices and software 

public segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 710 million  or 115  compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the increase was primarily driven by growth in government and healthcare net sales to government customers increased 201 primarily driven by client devices software and netcomm net sales to healthcare customers increased 118 primarily driven by client devices and software net sales to education customers increased 36 primarily driven by client devices and video partially offset by netcomm 

net sales in other which is comprised of results from our uk and canadian operations for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 275 million  or 146  compared to the year ended december 31 2018  both operations grew in local currency and canada growth included the incremental net sales from scalar the impact of foreign currency exchange decreased other net sales growth by approximately 430 basis points primarily due to the unfavorable translation of the british pound and canadian dollar to the us dollar 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 333 million  or 123  to 3040 million for the year ended december 31 2019  compared to 2707 million for the year ended december 31 2018  as a percentage of net sales gross profit margin increased 20 basis points to 169 for the year ended december 31 2019  gross profit margin was positively impacted by product margin and an increase in the mix of netted down revenues that are booked net of costs of goods sold partially offset by net sales growth outpacing partner funding growth 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 176 million  or 115  to 1713 million for the year ended december 31 2019  compared to 1537 million for the year ended december 31 2018  the increase was driven by higher sales payroll expenses consistent with higher gross profit 

as a percentage of total net sales selling and administrative expenses remained flat at 95 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  

operating income 

during 2019 we evaluated our methodology for allocating certain depreciation and amortization expenses to each of our segments the evaluation resulted in a revision to the allocation of depreciation and amortization expenses from headquarters to our reportable segments effective january 1 2019 the prior period results have been recast to reflect these changes and present comparable information 

operating income by segment in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change was as follows 



 not meaningful 

 operating income was 1134 million for the year ended december 31 2019  an increase of 147 million  or 148  compared to 987 million for the year ended december 31 2018  operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher payroll expenses total operating margin percentage increased 20 basis points to 63 for the year ended december 31 2019  from 61 for the year ended december 31 2018 due to an increase in gross profit margin and lower intangible asset amortization as a percentage of net sales partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses 

corporate segment operating income was 585 million for the year ended december 31 2019  an increase of 55 million  or 103  compared to 530 million for the year ended december 31 2018  corporate segment operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher payroll expenses corporate segment operating margin percentage remained flat at 78 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  

small business segment operating income was 108 million for the year ended december 31 2019  an increase of 14 million  or 139  compared to 94 million for the year ended december 31 2018  small business segment operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses small business segment operating margin percentage increased 20 basis points to 71 for the year ended december 31 2019  from 69 for the year ended december 31 2018 due to lower sales payroll expenses and lower intangible asset amortization as a percentage of net sales 

public segment operating income was 475 million for the year ended december 31 2019  an increase of 70 million  or 173  compared to 405 million for the year ended december 31 2018  public segment operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses public segment operating margin percentage increased 30 basis points to 69 for the year ended december 31 2019  from 66 for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to product margin 

other operating income was 102 million for the year ended december 31 2019  an increase of 20 million  or 248  compared to 82 million for the year ended december 31 2018  other operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher payroll expenses along with the unfavorable translation of the british pound and canadian dollar to the us dollar other operating margin percentage increased 30 basis points to 47 for the year ended december 31 2019  from 44 for the year ended december 31 2018 due to product margin and lower intangible asset amortization as a percentage of net sales partially offset by higher payroll expenses 

interest expense net 

interest expense net in 2019 was 159 million  an increase of 10 million  compared to 149 million in 2018  this increase was primarily due to paying an effective interest rate on the term loan in 2019 that exceeded the capped rate in 2018 and higher interest expense to finance the scalar acquisition 

income tax expense 

income tax expense was 213 million in 2019  compared to 198 million in 2018  the effective income tax rate expressed by calculating income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was 224 and 235 for 2019 and 2018  respectively 

for 2019 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes partially offset by tax credits excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation and a tax benefit related to cdw canadas acquisition of scalar for 2018 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes partially offset by excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation the 2019 effective tax rate was lower than 2018 primarily due to tax credits higher excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation and a discrete tax benefit related to cdw canadas acquisition of scalar 

nongaap financial measure reconciliations 

we have included reconciliations of nongaap operating income nongaap operating income margin nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income and net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 below 

nongaap operating income excludes among other things charges related to the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets equitybased compensation and the associated payroll taxes and acquisition and integration expenses nongaap operating income margin is defined as nongaap operating income as a percentage of net sales nongaap income before income taxes and nongaap net income exclude among other things charges related to acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization equitybased compensation acquisition and integration expenses and the associated tax effects of each net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period 

nongaap operating income nongaap operating income margin nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income and net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures 

we believe these measures provide analysts investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance management uses these measures to evaluate periodoverperiod performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business 

nongaap operating income 

nongaap operating income was 1368 million for the year ended december 31 2019  an increase of 151 million  or 125  compared to 1217 million for the year ended december 31 2018  as a percentage of net sales nongaap operating income was 76 and 75 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively

seasonality 

while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year sales in our corporate segment which primarily serves us private sector business customers with more than 250 employees are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year additionally sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations as of december 31 2019  we also have 10 billion of availability for borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility and an additional £ 50 million  66 million at december 31 2019  under the cdw uk revolving credit facility our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our 

operating commitments which primarily include the purchase of inventory payroll and general expenses we also take into consideration our overall capital allocation strategy which includes investment for future growth dividend payments acquisitions and share repurchases we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available for at least the next year however there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions 

longterm debt and financing arrangements 

on september 26 2019 we refinanced our 2023 senior notes through the issuance of 2028 senior notes on october 11 2019 we extended the maturity date of the term loan from august 2023 to october 2026 for additional information see note 9 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2019  we had total indebtedness of 33 billion  of which 16 billion was secured indebtedness at december 31 2019  we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures 

for additional information regarding our debt and refinancing activities see note 9 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

inventory financing agreements 

we have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions these amounts are classified separately as accounts payableinventory financing on the consolidated balance sheets we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due for additional information see note 6 inventory financing agreements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

share repurchase program 

during 2019  we repurchased 61 million shares of our common stock for 657 million under the previously announced share repurchase program on february 7 2019 we announced that our board of directors authorized a 10 billion increase to our share repurchase program for additional information see item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

dividends 

a summary of 2019 dividend activity for our common stock is as follows 



on february 6 2020  we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of 0380 per share the dividend will be paid on march 10 2020 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 25 2020  

the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions any potential indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are as follows 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities are as follows 





in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs we monitor our cash conversion cycle defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows 



 the cash conversion cycle decreased to 18 days at december 31 2019 compared to 19 days at december 31 2018 dso dio and dpo increased 1 day 1 day and 3 days respectively compared to december 31 2018 the increase in dso was primarily driven by higher net sales and thirdparty services such as software as a service and warranties these sales have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the consolidated statement of operations is recorded on a net basis this also results in a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheets without a corresponding cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales additionally dio increased due to high customerdriven and strategic stocking positions and timing of receipts and shipments 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased 245 million in 2019 compared to 2018  the increase was primarily due to capital expenditures due to revenue generating assets and the completion of our acquisition of scalar on february 1 2019 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 5 million in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to year ended december 31 2018  the decrease was primarily driven by refinancing of our 2023 senior notes through the issuance of 2028 senior notes further leveraging our inventory financing arrangements and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities which were partially offset by our share repurchases and increasing dividends per share in the year ended december 31 2019  for additional information regarding our debt activities see note 9 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

we have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments and operating leases our estimated future payments based on undiscounted amounts under contractual obligations that existed as of december 31 2019  are as follows 





offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

inflation 

inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results we generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing we also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements there can be no assurances however that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future 

commitments and contingencies 

the information set forth in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances historically we have not made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates as our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make 

estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below for additional information related to significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of different products and services significant judgment may be required when determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together 

for each deliverable that represents a distinct performance obligation total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the standalone selling prices of each performance obligation judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation for certain performance obligations we will use a combination of methods to estimate the standalone selling price based on recent transactions when evidence from recent transactions is not available to confirm that the prices are representative of the standalone selling price an expected cost plus margin approach is used 

additional judgment is required in determining whether we are the principal and report revenues on a gross basis or agent and report revenues on a net basis for each identified performance obligation in a transaction we evaluate the facts and circumstances present to determine whether or not we control the specified good or service prior to transfer to the customer this evaluation includes but is not limited to assessing indicators such as whether i we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service ii we have inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer and iii we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service when the evaluation indicates we control the specified good or service prior to transfer to the customer we are acting as a principal when the evaluation indicates we do not control the specified good or service prior transfer to the customer we are acting as an agent 

the nature of our contracts give rise to variable consideration in the form of sales returns and allowances we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount to which we are expected to be entitled the estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available 

we recognize revenue on performance obligations when the customer obtains control over the specified good or service that is when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the good or service for the sale of hardware and software this is generally upon delivery to the customer as a result we perform an analysis to estimate the amount of net sales intransit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been delivered to the customer this analysis requires judgment whereby we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales intransit to customers at the end of each reporting period based on a weightedaverage analysis of commercial delivery terms that include dropshipment arrangements changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days estimated to make this adjustment 

vendor programs 

we receive incentives from certain vendors related to cooperative advertising volume rebates bid programs price protection and other programs these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or merchandise inventory depending on the nature of the incentive we record vendor partner receivables related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets 

we also record reserves for vendor partner receivables for estimated losses due to vendors inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims in estimating the required allowance we take into consideration collections performance and the aging of the incentive receivables as well as specific vendor circumstances 

goodwill 

goodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis each december 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as part of our qualitative assessment judgment is required in weighing the effect of various positive and negative factors that may affect the fair value we consider various factors including the excess of fair value over carrying value from the last quantitative test macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations the projected financial performance and actual financial performance compared to prior year projected financial performance as well as other factors 

if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if indicators of impairment exist a quantitative impairment test is performed as part of the quantitative assessment application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur determination of our weighted average cost of capital future market conditions and profitability of future business strategies the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit however our past estimates of fair value would not have indicated an impairment when revised to include subsequent years  actual results 

intangible assets 

intangible assets include customer relationships trade names internally developed software and other intangibles intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset and reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgment and the use of estimates the valuation classification and assignment of useful lives are derived using market inputs historic experience and thirdparty guidance 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes and evaluating our tax positions requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions our annual effective tax rate is based on our income the jurisdictions in which the income is earned and subjected to taxation the tax laws in those various jurisdictions which can be affected by tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items and accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances 

we establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following 1 the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained 2 the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but for a lesser amount or 3 the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken reserves related to tax accruals and valuations allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law in the relevant jurisdictions and our future taxable income levels in the relevant jurisdictions with respect to valuation allowances

see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations for information on cash flows interest rates and maturity dates of our debt obligations 

foreign currency risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound and the canadian dollar which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations revenue and expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currencies of the corresponding countries the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the same as the corresponding local currency upon consolidation as results of operations are translated operating results may differ from expectations the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has not been material as the majority of our results of operations are denominated in us dollars

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some important factors that may cause our business prospects results of operations and cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our business 

global and regional economic and political conditions may have an adverse impact on our business 

weak economic conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic and political conditions government spending cuts and the impact of new government policies or a tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows for example there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the economic impact of the referendum on the uks membership of the european union eu advising for the exit of the uk from the eu and the subsequent notice delivered by the uk to the eu of the uks withdrawal referred to as brexit negotiations to determine the terms of the withdrawal including the terms of trade between the uk and the eu are ongoing although the full effects of brexit are uncertain and will be dependent on the outcome of such negotiations potential adverse consequences of brexit include global market uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities each of which could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public sector customers 

our sales to our public sector customers and our other customers that do business with our public sector customers are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels an adverse change in government spending policies such as budget cuts or limitations or temporary shutdowns of government operations shifts in budget priorities or reductions in revenue levels could cause our public sector customers or our other customers that do business with impacted public sector customers to reduce or delay their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally such adverse change in government spending policies shifts in budget priorities or reductions in revenue levels could impact cash collections from contracts with our other customers that do business with impacted public sector customers which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products 

our solutions portfolio includes products from oems software publishers and cloud providers we are authorized by these vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding including purchase rebates sales volume rebates purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows in addition a reduction in the amount or a change in the terms of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows particularly given our substantial indebtedness 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their 

products to solutions providers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we purchase the products included in our solutions portfolio both directly from our vendor partners and from wholesale distributors although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2018  products we purchased from wholesale distributors ingram micro synnex and tech data each represented approximately 10 of total us purchases in addition sales of products manufactured by apple cisco dell emc hewlett packard enterprise hp inc lenovo and microsoft whether purchased directly from these vendor partners or from a wholesale distributor represented in the aggregate nearly 60 of our 2018 consolidated net sales sales of products manufactured by cisco and hp inc represented approximately 25 of our 2018 consolidated net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other key vendor partners or the diminished availability of their products including due to backlogs for their products could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position 

additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows further the sale spinoff or combination of any of our vendor partners andor certain of their business units including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services offerings such as cloudbased solutions including software as a service saas infrastructure as a service iaas and platform as a service paas device as a service daas the internet of things iot and artificial intelligence we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services offerings as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers also customers may delay spending while they evaluate new technologies a decrease in the rate of innovation a lack of acceptance of innovations by our customers or delays in technology spending by our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware software and services offerings for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels our success is dependent on our ability to develop relationships with and sell hardware software and services from new emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace to the extent that a vendors offering that is highly in demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels or if we are unable to develop relationships with new technology providers or companies that we have not historically represented our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 



we expect the competitive landscape to continue to evolve as new technologies and consumption models are developed such as cloudbased and other as a service solutions hyperconverged infrastructure and embedded software solutions while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for instance while cloudbased solutions present an opportunity for us cloudbased solutions and technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell in addition some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to our customers moreover traditional oems have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers if we are unable to effectively respond to the evolving competitive landscape our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems including our business systems such as our sales customer management financial and accounting marketing purchasing warehouse management ecommerce and mobile systems as well as our operational platforms including voice and data networks and power systems the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

 

the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats both internal and external and from human error there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business and results of operations 

breaches of data security and the failure to protect our information technology systems from cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business 

our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers and others in addition we operate data centers for our customers that host their technology infrastructure and may store and transmit both businesscritical data and confidential information in connection with our services business some of our coworkers have access to our customers confidential data and other information we have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however as newer technologies evolve and the portfolio of the service providers we share confidential information with grows we could be exposed to increased risks from breaches in security including those from human error negligence or mismanagement or from illegal or fraudulent acts such as cyberattacks the evolving nature of threats to data security in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists including computer viruses malware phishing misrepresentation social engineering and forgery make it increasingly challenging to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks 

breaches in security could expose us our supply chain our customers or other individuals to significant disruptions a risk of public disclosure loss or misuse of this information security breaches could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information as well as the loss of existing or potential 

customers and damage to our brand and reputation moreover media or other reports of perceived vulnerabilities in our network security or perceived lack of security within our environment even if inaccurate could adversely impact our reputation and materially impact our business the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the failure to comply with our public sector contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things termination fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues from our public sector customers are derived from sales to governmental entities educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services sales to public sector customers are highly regulated noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including the false claims act the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the us or security clearance and confidentiality requirements could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public sector customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with governmental entities or other customers in the public sector in addition contracts in the public sector are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization gpo or upon default furthermore our inability to enter into or retain contracts with gpos may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those gpos and compete effectively the effect of any of these possible actions or failures could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our service offerings include field services managed services warranties configuration services partner services and telecom services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers we also offer certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers businesses this could among other things result in legal claims and proceedings and liability for us moreover as we expand our services and solutions business and provide increasingly complex services and solutions we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory and other risks we also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation with our customers our brand and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract develop engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business including our key executive management sales services and technical coworkers 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of our chief executive officer as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers our future success also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our customerfacing coworkers who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with many of our customers in addition as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers for whom the market is extremely competitive 

if we are unable to attract develop engage and retain key personnel our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and our ability to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions could be adversely affected moreover if we are unable to continue to train our sales services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel could decrease such consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

our business depends on the timely supply of products in order to meet the demands of our customers manufacturing interruptions or delays including as a result of the financial instability or bankruptcy of manufacturers significant labor disputes such as strikes natural disasters or other adverse occurrences affecting any of our suppliers facilities could disrupt our supply chain suppliers may also fail to accurately forecast customer demand or may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of product to meet customer demand resulting in the reduced supply of product available to us 

our supply chain is also exposed to risks related to international operations while we purchase our products primarily in the markets we serve for example products for us customers are sourced in the us our vendor partners manufacture or purchase a significant portion of the products we sell outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events related to international operations that could cause disruptions to our supply chain include 

 we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell or any components of those products are purchased or manufactured will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargoes sanctions safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition our exports are subject to regulations some of which may be inconsistent and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business 

we have two warehouse and distribution facilities in the us and one in the uk if the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence we could utilize another distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate three customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

increases in the cost of commercial delivery services or disruptions of those services could adversely impact our business 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services including those that may result from an increase in fuel or personnel costs our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes inclement weather natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver or receive products on a timely basis 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales typically on 30day payment terms we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced this risk is heightened during periods of global or industryspecific economic downturn or uncertainty during periods of rising interest rates or in the case of public sector customers during periods of budget constraints significant failures of customers to timely pay all amounts due to us could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and 

policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request or to manage supply chain interruptions if we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or if customers reduce or delay orders we would be exposed to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 

we could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may continue to pursue transactions including strategic investments acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous business risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses there can be no assurance that the intended benefits of our investments acquisitions and alliances will be realized or that those benefits will offset these numerous risks or other unforeseen factors any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly which may result in volatility in the market price of our stock and could impact our ability to operate our business effectively 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades 

our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including general macroeconomic conditions pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our reported results of operations 

our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements while our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our international subsidiaries particularly the british pound and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in our reported results of operations we also have foreign currency exposure to the extent sales and purchases are not denominated in a subsidiarys functional currency which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits which may result in substantial costs and expenses or interruption of our normal business operations 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial employment tort and other litigation 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services in the form 

of ceaseanddesist letters licensing inquiries lawsuits and other communications and demands in our industry such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased increasingly many of these assertions are brought by nonpracticing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue but we may also be subject to demands from inventors competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue lost profits andor an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities including selling certain products or services 

we also are subject to proceedings investigations and audits by federal state international national provincial and local authorities including as a result of our significant sales to governmental entities we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts 

current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

failure to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to numerous complex federal state provincial local and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas including labor and employment advertising ecommerce tax trade import and export requirements economic and trade sanctions anticorruption data privacy requirements including those under the european union general data protection regulation anticompetition environmental and health and safety the evaluation of and compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and these laws and regulations may have other adverse impacts on our business results of operations or cash flows furthermore these laws and regulations are evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business and the risk of noncompliance 

we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no guarantee against coworkers contractors or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures 

as a public company we also are subject to increasingly complex public disclosure corporate governance and accounting requirements that increase compliance costs and require significant management focus 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have important consequences to our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2018  we had 32 billion of total longterm debt outstanding as defined by gaap and 429 million of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements and the ability to borrow an additional 11 billion under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit loan facility the revolving loan and an additional £ 50 million  64 million at december 31 2018  under our cdw uk revolving credit facility our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 



 restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs a breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities the lenders 

 the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures 

if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior credit facilities if the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness even if we were able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us 

in addition under our revolving loan we are permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of up to 11 billion  however our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition the borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors eligible accounts receivable net of accounts reserves up to 30 of such eligible accounts receivable which can consist of federal government accounts receivable plus the lesser of i 75 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves and ii the product of 85 multiplied by the net orderly liquidation value percentage multiplied by eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves less reserves other than accounts reserves and inventory reserves the borrowing base in effect as of december 31 2018 was 18 billion and therefore did not restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving loan as of that date 

our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is also limited by a minimum liquidity condition which provides that if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of i 125 million and ii the greater of a 10 of the borrowing base and b 100 million the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under our revolving loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving loan is at least 100 to 100 it is an event of default under our revolving loan if our excess cash availability and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio remain below such levels for a period of five or more consecutive business days moreover our revolving loan provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability reserves which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us we cannot assure you that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or were it to do so that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity 

we will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and if not successful we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control our outstanding longterm debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us and accordingly we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources included elsewhere in this report 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or revise or delay our strategic plan we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms that are favorable to us or at all that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements including our senior credit facilities and indentures in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations our senior credit facilities restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result 

 despite our indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt including secured debt this could further increase the risks associated with our leverage 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above including our possible inability to service our debt will increase as of december 31 2018  we had 11 billion available for additional borrowing under our revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations net of 1 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit and 393 million of reserves related to our floorplan subfacility and an additional £ 50 million  64 million at december 31 2018  available under our cdw uk revolving credit facility 

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2018  we had 15 billion of variable rate debt outstanding if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility 

to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate cap agreements in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock which may be caused by a number of factors many of which we cannot control including the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and the following 

 in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies including companies in our industry in the past securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility if we were involved in securities litigation we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business 

in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our thenoutstanding shares of our common stock and depress our stock price 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors these provisions 



our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15 of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on or make share repurchases of our common stock if we do not continue to pay dividends you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price 

we expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock currently at the rate of 0295 per share per quarter or 118 per share per annum however any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors any determination to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions any potential indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors our board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will repurchase shares of our common stock if we do not pay dividends in the future realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur 

we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 

we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us the deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us

trends and key factors affecting our financial performance 

we believe the following key factors may have a meaningful impact on our business performance influencing our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted financial and operating results 



key business metrics 

we monitor a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin net income nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income net income per common share nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin free cash flow return on working capital cash and cash equivalents net working capital cash conversion cycle defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios sales per coworker and coworker turnover these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management so that actions can be taken as necessary in order to achieve the standards and objectives 

in this form 10k we discuss nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin which are nongaap financial measures 

we believe these measures provide analysts investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance management uses these measures to evaluate periodoverperiod performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business additionally adjusted ebitda is a measure in the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility the term loan used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments incur additional debt and make restricted payments such as dividends and share repurchases as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments for further details regarding the term loan see longterm debt and financing arrangements within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 9 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the definitions of nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income and adjusted ebitda and reconciliations to net income see results of operations 

the results of certain key business metrics are as follows 





results of operations 

year ended december 31 2018 compared to year ended december 31 2017 

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net sales are as follows 





net sales 

net sales by segment in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales are as follows 



 total net sales for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 1408 million  or 95  to 16241 million  compared to 14833 million for the year ended december 31 2017  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations constant currency net sales growth was 92  

for the year ended december 31 2018  sales growth was driven by ongoing focus on client device refresh the underlying demand for solutions and strong growth from our international operations 

corporate segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 670 million  or 108  compared to the year ended december 31 2017  growth was primarily driven by client device refresh as well as continued success helping customers with solutions including data center and software 

small business segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 139 million  or 114  between periods sales growth was primarily driven by client device refresh 

public segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 248 million  or 42  compared to the year ended december 31 2017  education net sales increased 65  primarily driven by continued success addressing client device and networking needs for both k12 and higher education customers net sales in healthcare increased 73  primarily driven by performance in client devices and video as customers moved forward on refresh projects net sales to government customers were flat compared to the prior year federal net sales were lower due to the prior year success of meeting the department of defense mandate to move to new client devices with stronger security features federal net sales were nearly fully offset by the success of executing against contracts to state and local government customers including meeting public safety needs 

net sales in other which is comprised of results from our uk and canadian operations for the year ended december 31 2018 increased 351 million  or 229  compared to the year ended december 31 2017  both operations had strong growth in local currency as we continued to take share in the local markets in addition uk growth was driven in part by increased sales from referrals for usbased customers the impact of foreign currency exchange increased other sales growth by approximately 270 basis points primarily due to the favorable translation of the british pound to us dollar 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 257 million  or 105  to 2707 million for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 2450 million for the year ended december 31 2017  as a percentage of net sales gross profit margin increased 20 basis points to 167 for the year ended december 31 2018  gross profit margin was impacted by an increase in the mix of revenue recognized on a net basis such as software as a service and warranties as well as improved product margin this was partially offset by yearoveryear net sales growth outpacing the yearoveryear growth rate in partner funding 

gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix revenue recognized on a net basis pricing strategies market conditions and other factors 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 127 million  or 90  to 1537 million for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 1410 million for the year ended december 31 2017  the increase was driven by higher sales payroll expenses including sales commissions primarily due to higher gross profit dollars and higher coworker costs due to higher attainment of performancebased compensation 

as a percentage of total net sales selling and administrative expenses remained flat at 95 for the year ended december 31 2018  

operating income 

operating income by segment in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change was as follows 



  

 not meaningful 

 operating income was 987 million for the year ended december 31 2018  an increase of 120 million  or 139  compared to 867 million for the year ended december 31 2017  operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses and higher coworker costs due to higher attainment on performancebased compensation total operating margin percentage increased 30 basis points to 61 for the year ended december 31 2018  from 58 for the year ended december 31 2017  the increase was primarily due to gross profit margin expansion driven by a higher mix into revenue recognized on a net basis as well as improved product margin lower intangible asset amortization and equitybased compensation expense and the associated payroll taxes as a percentage of net sales which do not trend in line with sales movement also had a favorable impact on the operating margin percentage this was partially offset by higher attainment on performancebased compensation expense as a percentage of net sales 

corporate segment operating income was 537 million for the year ended december 31 2018  an increase of 49 million  or 100  compared to 488 million for the year ended december 31 2017  corporate segment operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars driven by higher sales partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses corporate segment operating margin percentage decreased 10 basis points to 78 for the year ended december 31 2018  from 79 for the year ended december 31 2017  the decrease was driven by higher attainment on performancebased compensation expense as a percentage of net sales 

small business segment operating income was 96 million for the year ended december 31 2018  an increase of 22 million  or 288  compared to 74 million for the year ended december 31 2017  small business segment operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars small business segment operating margin percentage increased 90 basis points to 70 for the year ended december 31 2018  from 61 for the year ended december 31 2017  this increase in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by a higher mix into revenue recognized on a net basis and the benefit of lower sales payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales this was partially offset by higher attainment on performancebased compensation expense as a percentage of net sales 

public segment operating income was 411 million for the year ended december 31 2018  an increase of 37 million  or 97  compared to 374 million for the year ended december 31 2017  public segment operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses public segment operating margin percentage increased 40 basis points to 67 for the year ended december 31 2018  from 63 for the year ended december 31 2017  this 

increase in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by a higher mix into revenue recognized on a net basis partially offset by higher performancebased compensation expense as a percentage of net sales 

other operating income was 82 million for the year ended december 31 2018  an increase of 25 million  or 439  compared to 57 million for the year ended december 31 2017  other operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses foreign exchange translation also had a favorable impact on operating income other operating margin percentage increased 70 basis points to 44 for the year ended december 31 2018  from 37 for the year ended december 31 2017  this increase was primarily due to lower sales payroll expenses and lower intangible asset amortization as a percentage of net sales which does not trend in line with sales movement 

net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt 

for information regarding our debt see note 9 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements during 2017  we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt of 57 million  

net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt are as follows 





income tax expense 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted into law the tax cuts and jobs act changed several aspects of us federal tax law including reducing the us corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 beginning on january 1 2018 applying a onetime tax on the deemed mandatory repatriation of the companys unremitted foreign earnings which have not been subject to us tax imposing a minimum us tax on foreign earnings providing for the immediate expensing of certain qualified property and changing the tax treatment of performancebased executive compensation and certain employee fringe benefits 

the sec issued staff accounting bulletin 118 allowing for provisional amounts to be recorded during a measurement period not to exceed one year during the year ended december 31 2017 the company recorded provisional amounts for the impact of revaluing deferred tax assets and liabilities the deemed mandatory repatriation tax on the companys unremitted foreign earnings and the state income tax effects from the changes in federal tax law the company adjusted the us federal and state provisional amounts during 2018 recording a net tax benefit of 2 million the adjustment was primarily driven by the rate differential on adjustments to temporary booktax differences made in finalizing the 2017 federal income tax return and finalizing the deemed mandatory repatriation tax on the companys unremitted foreign earnings 

income tax expense was 198 million in 2018  compared to 138 million in 2017  the effective income tax rate expressed by calculating income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was 235 and 208 for 2018 and 2017  respectively 

for 2018 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes partially offset by excess tax benefits on equity compensation for 2017 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a onetime benefit of 96 million to reflect the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities excess tax benefits on equity compensation and lower corporate tax rates on our international income partially offset by state income taxes and a onetime charge of 20 million for the mandatory repatriation tax the 2018 effective tax rate was higher than 2017 primarily due to the benefits recorded in 2017 for the tax cuts and jobs act and excess tax benefits which exceeded the benefit in 2018 from the lower federal income rate in 2018 and partially offset by a higher state income taxes 

nongaap financial measure reconciliations 

we have included reconciliations of nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 below 

nongaap income before income taxes and nongaap net income exclude among other things charges related to the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets equitybased compensation and the associated tax benefits integration expenses and gains and losses from the extinguishment of longterm debt ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense net income tax expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below adjusted ebitda margin is defined as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period 

nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures 

we believe these measures provide analysts investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance management uses these measures to evaluate periodoverperiod performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business additionally adjusted ebitda is a measure in the credit agreement governing our term loan used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments incur additional debt and make restricted payments such as dividends and share repurchases as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments for further details regarding the term loan see note 9 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

nongaap net income 

nongaap net income was 794 million for the year ended december 31 2018  an increase of 188 million  or 311  compared to 606 million for the year ended december 31 2017

results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net sales are as follows 





net sales 

net sales by segment in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales are as follows 



 total net sales in 2017 increased 1160 million  or 85  to 14833 million  compared to 13673 million for the year ended december 31 2016  net sales on a constant currency basis which excludes the impact of currency translation for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 1188 million or 87 to 14833 million compared to 13645 million for the year ended december 31 2016  

for the year ended december 31 2017  sales growth was driven by gains in all our customer markets except healthcare which saw a net sales decline year over year during 2017 and in contrast to 2016 we saw an acceleration of hardware sales driven by strong growth within client device sales due to customer refresh which impacted categories such as notebooks mobile devices and desktops additionally we saw growth in several other categories including video and networking we also saw ongoing customer focus on designing it securely which led to strong sales growth across our entire security portfolio and the adoption of more efficient architectures which drove strong growth in hyperconverged infrastructure and solutions delivered via the cloud as well as the continuing trend of greater integration of software into solutions 

corporate segment net sales in 2017 increased 438 million  or 76  compared to 2016 as customer confidence improved throughout the year growth was primarily driven by customer refresh of client devices and networking 

small business segment net sales in 2017 increased by 102 million  or 91  compared to 2016 sales growth was primarily driven by customer refresh of client devices and video 

public segment net sales in 2017 increased 429 million  or 78  compared to 2016 the growth was primarily driven by government and education customers net sales to federal government customers reflected a focus on spending existing budgets on planned projects and ongoing successful alignment with strategic programs as well as success meeting the department of defense mandated move to new client devices with stronger security features strong net sales to our state and local government customers was driven by a continued focus on public safety and the ongoing success executing against recently added contracts net sales to our higher education customers were driven by networking and software as we continued to see the benefit from connected campus strategies to ensure network infrastructures can handle multiple devices used by students faculty and visitors across the entire campus k12 growth was driven by success in delivering collaborative learning environments and networking net sales to healthcare customers decreased 34  reflecting continued customer uncertainty related to reimbursements and funding 

net sales in other for 2017 increased 191 million  or 142  compared to 2016  other is comprised of results from our uk and canadian operations both operations had strong growth in local currency as we continued to take share in the local 

markets as well as the benefit from increased sales for referrals from us customers to the uk the impact of foreign currency exchange decreased other sales growth by approximately 250 basis points due to the impact resulting from the british pound to us dollar translation partially offset by favorable translation of the canadian to us dollar 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 122 million  or 52  to 2450 million in 2017  compared to 2328 million in 2016  as a percentage of net sales gross profit decreased 50 basis points to 165 in 2017  down from 170 in 2016  although there was an increase in gross profit due to higher sales volumes we experienced a decline in our gross profit margin this decline was primarily driven by product margin compression due to increased hardware sales which generally have lower profit margins and an ongoing competitive marketplace 

gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix revenue recognized on a net basis pricing strategies market conditions and other factors 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 65 million  or 48  to 1410 million in 2017  compared to 1345 million in 2016  this was driven by higher sales payroll expenses including sales commissions primarily due to higher gross profit as well as higher coworker costs consistent with increased coworker count total coworker count was 8726 at december 31 2017 up 210 from 8516 at december 31 2016 additionally equitybased compensation expense and the associated payroll taxes increased 8 million or 198 during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the impact of annual equity awards granted under our longterm incentive plan and the vesting of an equity grant made at the time of our initial public offering also during 2017  a retroactive illinois state law change was enacted which required the reinstatement of unclaimed property balances resulting in an additional 4 million of expenses these increases were partially offset by lower senior management incentive compensation 

as a percentage of total net sales selling and administrative expenses decreased 30 basis points to 95 in 2017 down from 98 in 2016

operating income was 867 million in 2017  an increase of 47 million  or 57  compared to 820 million in 2016  although operating income increased total operating margin percentage decreased 20 basis points to 58 in 2017  from 60 in 2016  the decrease was primarily due to gross profit margin compression from higher hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace also contributing to lower operating margin percentage was the reinstatement of prior year unclaimed property balances in 2017 and the nonrecurrence of the settlement payments received from the dynamic random access memory class action lawsuits in 2016 partially offsetting these decreases were lower sales payroll consistent with our variable compensation cost structure lower senior management incentive compensation and a decline in intangible asset amortization expense as a percentage of net sales 

corporate segment operating income was 488 million in 2017  an increase of 34 million  or 76  compared to 454 million in 2016  corporate segment operating margin remained flat at 79 for 2017 and 2016  although operating income increased primarily due to an increase in sales volume corporate segment operating margin percentage remained flat the flat operating margin percentage reflects higher hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace which were fully offset by lower sales payroll expenses 

small business segment operating income was 74 million in 2017  an increase of 5 million  or 74  compared to 69 million in 2016  operating income increased due to an increase in sales volume while operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 61 for 2017  the decrease in operating margin percentage reflects higher hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace which were offset by lower sales payroll expenses 

public segment operating income was 374 million in 2017  an increase of 6 million  or 18  compared to 368 million in 2016  public segment operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 63 in 2017  from 67 in 2016  this decrease in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by higher hardware sales which were partially offset by lower sales payroll expenses 

other operating income was 57 million in 2017  an increase of 12 million  or 282  compared to 45 million in 2016  other operating income increased primarily due to higher sales volumes and gross profit as we continued to take share in the local markets other operating margin percentage increased 40 basis points to 37 in 2017  from 33 in 2016  this increase was primarily driven by a decline in intangible asset amortization expense as a percentage of net sales 

interest expense net 

net interest expense in 2017 was 151 million an increase of 4 million compared to 147 million in 2016  this increase was primarily driven by marktomarket gains recognized on our interest rate cap agreements in 2016 with no comparable activity in 2017 due to the election of hedge accounting in february 2017 and by a rising interest rate environment which resulted in higher interest expense on the term loan this was partially offset by a reduced coupon rate due to the refinancing activity that occurred during 2017 

net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt 

for information regarding our debt see note 9 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements during 2017  we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt of 57 million compared to 2 million in 2016  

net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt are as follows 





income tax expense 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted into law the tax cuts and jobs act changed several aspects of us federal tax law including reducing the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning on january 1 2018 establishing a territorial tax system which includes a onetime tax on the deemed mandatory repatriation of our international operations unremitted earnings which have not been subject to us tax imposing a minimum us tax on foreign earnings providing for the immediate expensing of certain qualified property and changing the tax treatment of performance based executive compensation and certain employee fringe benefits gaap requires the income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act to be accounted for in the period of enactment 

the sec issued staff accounting bulletin 118 allowing for provisional amounts to be recorded during a measurement period not to exceed one year we recorded provisional amounts for the impact of revaluing deferred tax assets and liabilities the deemed mandatory repatriation tax of our international operations unremitted earnings and the state income tax effects from the change in federal tax law 

income tax expense was 138 million in 2017  compared to 248 million in 2016  the effective income tax rate expressed by calculating income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was 208 and 369 for 2017 and 2016  respectively 

for 2017  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a onetime benefit of 96 million to reflect the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities under the tax cuts and jobs act excess tax benefits on equity compensation and lower corporate tax rates on our international income partially offset by state income taxes and a onetime charge of 20 million for the mandatory repatriation tax under the tax cuts and jobs act for 2016  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and nondeductible meals and entertainment expenses which were partially offset by lower corporate tax rates on our international income a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the uk and excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation as a result of adopting asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation the lower effective tax rate for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to the impact of revaluing deferred tax assets and liabilities and excess tax benefits on equity compensation offset by a onetime charge for the mandatory repatriation tax

seasonality 

while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year sales in our corporate segment which primarily serves private sector business customers with more than 250 employees are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year additionally 

sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations as of december 31 2018  we also have 11 billion of availability for borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility and an additional £ 50 million  64 million at december 31 2018  under the cdw uk revolving credit facility our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our operating commitments which primarily include the purchase of inventory payroll and general expenses we also take into consideration our overall capital allocation strategy which includes investment for future growth dividend payments acquisitions and stock repurchases we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available for at least the next year however there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions

or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are as follows 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities are as follows 



 



 in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs we monitor our cash conversion cycle defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows 



 the cash conversion cycle was 19 days at december 31 2018 and 2017  the increase in dso was primarily driven by higher net sales and related accounts receivable recognized on a net basis such as saas software assurance and warranties and longer payment cycles for certain public segment customers the thirdparty services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the consolidated statement of operations is recorded on a net basis this also results in a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sales in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales dpo was also impacted by the timing of inventory purchases 

the cash conversion cycle was 19 days at december 31 2017 and 2016 the increase in dso was primarily driven by higher net sales and related accounts receivable recognized on a net basis such as saas software assurance and warranties these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the consolidated statement of operations is recorded on a net basis this also results in a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sales in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales in addition dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased 5 million in 2018 compared to 2017  the increase in cash used primarily related to improvements to our information technology systems 

net cash used in investing activities increased 15 million in 2017 compared to 2016 the increase in cash used was primarily related to improvements to our information technology systems 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 64 million in 2018 compared to 2017  the decrease was primarily driven by 2017 payments to extinguish longterm debt which did not repeat in 2018 an increase in stock options exercised and lower incentive compensation plan withholding taxes partially offset by an increase in dividends paid 

net cash used in financing activities increased 514 million in 2017 compared to 2016  the increase was primarily driven by changes in accounts payableinventory financing which resulted in an increase in cash used in financing activities of 228 million and by share repurchases during 2017  which resulted in an increase in cash used in financing activities of 167 million  the increase in cash used for accounts payableinventory financing was primarily driven by the termination of one of our inventory financing agreements in the fourth quarter of 2016 with amounts owed subsequently reported as accounts payable  trade on the consolidated balance sheet which reduced cash flows reported as financing activities during 2017 in addition an increase in incentive compensation plan tax withholdings paid of 50 million  coupled with an increase in dividends paid of 28 million  contributed to the increase in cash used in financing activities 

contractual obligations 

we have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments operating leases and asset retirement obligations our estimated future payments based on undiscounted amounts under contractual obligations that existed as of december 31 2018  are as follows 





offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

inflation 

inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results we generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing we also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize 

productivity improvements there can be no assurances however that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances historically we have not made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates as our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below for more information related to significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of different products and services significant judgment may be required when determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together 

for each deliverable that represents a distinct performance obligation total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the standalone selling prices of each performance obligation judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation for certain performance obligations we will use a combination of methods to estimate the standalone selling price based on recent transactions when evidence from recent transactions is not available to confirm that the prices are representative of the standalone selling price an expected cost plus a margin approach is used 

additional judgment is required in determining whether we are the principal and report revenues on a gross basis or agent and report revenues on a net basis we evaluate the following indicators amongst others when determining whether we are acting as a principal in the transaction and recording revenue on a gross basis i we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service ii we have inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer or after transfer of control to the customer and iii we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service if the terms of a transaction do not indicate we are acting as a principal in the transaction then we are acting as an agent in the transaction and the associated revenues are recognized on a net basis 

the nature of our contracts give rise to variable consideration in the form of sales returns and allowances we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount to which we are expected to be entitled the estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available 

we generally recognize revenue on the sale of hardware and software products upon delivery to the customer as a result we perform an analysis to estimate the amount of net sales intransit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been delivered to the customer this analysis requires judgment whereby we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales intransit to customers at the end of each reporting period based on a weightedaverage analysis of commercial delivery terms that include dropshipment arrangements changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days estimated to make this adjustment 

vendor programs 

we receive incentives from certain vendors related to cooperative advertising volume rebates bid programs price protection and other programs these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or merchandise inventory depending on the nature of the incentive we record vendor partner receivables related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets 

we also record reserves for vendor partner receivables for estimated losses due to vendors inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims in estimating the required allowance we take into consideration collections performance and the aging of the incentive receivables as well as specific vendor circumstances 

goodwill 

goodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis each december 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as part of our qualitative assessment judgment is required in weighing the effect of various positive and negative factors that may affect the fair value we consider various factors including the excess of fair value over carrying value from the last quantitative test macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations the projected financial performance and actual financial performance compared to prior year projected financial performance as well as other factors 

if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if indicators of impairment exist a quantitative impairment test is performed as part of the quantitative assessment application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur determination of our weighted average cost of capital future market conditions and profitability of future business strategies the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit however our past estimates of fair value would not have been materially different when revised to include subsequent years  actual results 

intangible assets 

intangible assets include customer relationships trade names internally developed software and other intangibles intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the asset and reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgment and the use of estimates the valuation classification and assignment of useful lives were derived using market inputs historic experience and thirdparty guidance 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes and evaluating our tax positions requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions our annual effective tax rate is based on our income the jurisdictions in which the income is earned and subjected to taxation the tax laws in those various jurisdictions which can be affected by tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items and accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances 

we establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following 1 the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained 

2 the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but for a lesser amount or 3 the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken reserves related to tax accruals and valuations allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law in the relevant jurisdictions and our future taxable income levels in the relevant jurisdictions with respect to valuation allowances

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks 

interest rate risk 

our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates the interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility our senior secured term loan facility and the cdw uk term loan are floating and therefore are subject to fluctuations in order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility we have entered into interest rate caps to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2018  we have interest rate cap agreements in effect with a combined notional amount of 14 billion for additional details see note 8 financial instruments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations for information on cash flows interest rates and maturity dates of our debt obligations 

foreign currency risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound and the canadian dollar which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations revenue and expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currencies of the corresponding countries the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the same as the corresponding local currency upon consolidation as results of operations are translated operating results may differ from expectations the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has not been material as the majority of our results of operations are denominated in us dollars

product procurement 

we may purchase all or only some of the products our vendor partners offer for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions which may include one or more of the following product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements we also purchase software from major software publishers and cloud providers for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer our agreements allow the enduser customer to acquire cloudbased solutions software or licensed products and services 

in addition to purchasing products directly from our vendor partners we purchase products from wholesale distributors for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer these wholesale distributors provide logistics management and supplychain services for us as well as for our vendor partners 

for our us operations we purchased approximately 50  of the products we sold as discrete products or as components of a solution directly from our vendor partners and the remaining 50 from wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2017  purchases from our three largest wholesale distributors ingram micro synnex and tech data are each approximately 10 of total 2017 purchases 

inventory management 

we operate two distribution centers in north america a 513000 square foot facility in north las vegas nevada and a 442000 square foot facility in vernon hills illinois we also operate a 120000 square foot distribution center in rugby warwickshire uk we ship over 40 million  units annually on an aggregate basis from our distribution centers

 5 

we believe that the location of our distribution centers allows us to efficiently ship products to our customers and provide timely access to our principal distributors 

we believe competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of the product categories that we offer 

competition 

the market for technology products and services is highly competitive and subject to economic conditions and rapid technological changes competition is based on many things including the ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs the quality and breadth of product and service offerings knowledge and expertise of sales force customer service price product availability speed of delivery and credit availability we face competition from resellers direct manufacturers large service providers cloud providers telecommunication companies and to a lesser extent etailers and retailers smaller local or regional value added resellers typically focus on a single solution suite or portfolio of solutions from one or two vendor partners 

we believe we are well positioned to compete within this marketplace due to our competitive advantages we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to evolve as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for a discussion of the risks associated with competition see item 1a “risk factors” 

we believe we have sustainable competitive advantages that differentiate us in the marketplace we have built a strong sales organization and deep services and solutions capabilities over time and expect to continue to invest to enhance these capabilities which we believe when combined with our competitive advantages of scale and a performance driven culture will help drive sustainable profitable growth for us today and in the future our scale enables us to have a national and international footprint as well as invest in resources to meet specific customer endmarket needs our sellers are organized around unique customer endmarkets that are both vertically and geographically focused our scale enables our ability to invest in technical coworkers who work directly with our sellers to help customers implement increasingly complex it solutions our scale also enables us to operate our three distribution centers two in the us and one in the uk which combined are more than 1 million square feet in size with the acquisition of cdw uk in 2015 we have crossborder relationships that enable us to serve the needs of our us uk and canadianbased customers in more than 80 countries our strong executionoriented culture is underpinned by our compensation system 

our offerings 

our offerings range from discrete hardware and software products and services to complex integrated solutions including one or more of these elements we believe our customers increasingly view technology purchases as integrated solutions rather than discrete product and service categories we estimate that more than 40 of our net sales in 2017  in the us came from sales of product categories and services typically associated with solutions our hardware products include notebooksmobile devices including tablets network communications desktop computers video monitors enterprise and data storage printers and servers our software products include application suites security virtualization operating systems and network management our services include warranties managed services consulting design and implementation 

today it is critical to both “run the business” and drive greater growth and productivity to help our customers accomplish their goals we have built a robust portfolio of solutions across data center digital workspace security virtualization and services that we provide in physical virtual or cloudbased environments 

we provide public cloud solutions which reside off customer premises on a public shared infrastructure and private cloud solutions which reside on customer premises we also offer hybrid cloud solutions that deliver the benefits of both public and private solutions our migration integration and managed services offerings help our customers simplify cloud adoption as well as the ongoing management of cloud solutions across the entire it lifecycle dedicated cloud client executives work with our customers to architect cloud solutions meeting their organizational technology and financial objectives 

we offer a broad portfolio of integrated solutions that include the following on and offpremise capabilities

our internal capabilities 

our coworkers 

as of december 31 2017 we employed 8726  coworkers with approximately 7200 coworkers in the us 1100 in the uk and 400 in canada approximately two thirds of our coworkers at yearend 2017 were customer facing over half of our net sales are generated by account managers who have greater than seven years of experience account managers are supported by field sellers highly skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers we believe this structure to be core to our ability to continue to offer complex it solutions and services 

none of our coworkers are covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our coworker relations to be good 

marketing 

we market the cdw brand to us british and canadian audiences using a variety of channels that include online broadcast print social and other media we market to current and prospective customers through integrated marketing programs including behaviorally targeted email print online media events and sponsorships as well as broadcast media this promotion is also supported by integrated communication efforts targeting decisionmakers influencers and the general public using a combination of news releases case studies media interviews and speaking opportunities 

as a result of our relationships with our vendor partners a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs these programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time we believe that our results and analytical techniques that measure the efficacy of our marketing programs differentiate us from our competitors 

information technology systems 

we maintain customized it and unified communication systems that enhance our ability to provide prompt efficient and expert service to our customers in addition these systems enable centralized management of key functions including purchasing inventory management billing and collection of accounts receivable sales and distribution our systems provide us with thorough detailed and realtime information regarding key aspects of our business this capability helps us to continuously enhance productivity ship customer orders quickly and efficiently respond appropriately to industry changes and provide high levels of customer service we believe our websites which provide electronic order processing and advanced tools such as order tracking reporting and asset management make it easy for customers to transact business with us and ultimately strengthen our customer relationships

history 

founded in 1984 cdw became a public company in 1993 in 2003 we purchased selected us assets and the canadian operations of micro warehouse which extended our growth platform into canada in 2006 we acquired berbee information networks corporation a regional provider of technology products solutions and customized engineering services in advanced technologies primarily across cisco ibm and microsoft portfolios this acquisition increased our capabilities in customized engineering services and managed services 

we were a public company from 1993 until 2007 when we were acquired through a merger transaction by an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with madison dearborn partners llc “madison dearborn” and providence equity partners llc “providence equity” cdw corporation continued as the surviving corporation and same legal entity after the acquisition but became a wholly owned subsidiary of vh holdings inc a delaware corporation

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some important factors that may cause our business prospects results of operations and cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our business 

global and regional economic and political conditions may have an adverse impact on our business 

weak economic conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic and political conditions government spending cuts and the impact of new government policies or a tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows for example there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the economic impact of the referendum on the uk’s membership of the european union “eu” advising for the exit of the uk from the eu referred to as “brexit” potential adverse consequences of brexit such as global market uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates greater restrictions on imports and exports between uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public sector customers 

our sales to our public sector customers are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels an adverse change in government spending policies such as budget cuts or limitations budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public sector customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows for example in 2013 as a result of sequestration and related budget uncertainty and the partial shutdown of the us federal government for 16 days we experienced significantly reduced us federal sales in our public segment 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products 

we purchase products for resale from vendor partners which include oems and software publishers and wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2017  we purchased approximately 50  of the products we sold directly from vendor partners and the remaining amount from wholesale distributors for our north american operations we are authorized by vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding including purchase rebates sales volume rebates purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows in addition a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows particularly given our substantial indebtedness 

 9 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2017  products we purchased from wholesale distributors ingram micro synnex and tech data each represented approximately 10 of total us purchases in addition sales of products manufactured by apple cisco dell emc hewlett packard enterprise hp inc lenovo and microsoft whether purchased directly from these vendor partners or from a wholesale distributor represented in the aggregate nearly 60  of our 2017  consolidated net sales sales of products manufactured by cisco and hp inc represented over 25 of our 2017  consolidated net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other key vendor partners or the diminished availability of their products including due to backlogs for their products leading to manufacturer allocation could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position 

additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows further the sale spinoff or combination of any of our vendor partners andor certain of their business units including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services offerings such as cloudbased solutions including saas infrastructure as a service “iaas” and platform as a service “paas” device as a service “daas” and the internet of things “iot” we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services offerings as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers also customers may delay spending while they evaluate new technologies a decrease in the rate of innovation or the lack of acceptance of innovations or delays in technology spending by customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware software and services offerings for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels in addition our success is dependent on our ability to develop relationships with and sell hardware software and services from new emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace to the extent that a vendor’s offering that is highly in demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels or we are unable to develop relationships with new technology providers or companies that we have not historically represented our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 



 10 

 we expect the competitive landscape to continue to evolve as new technologies are developed such as cloudbased solutions hyperconverged infrastructure and embedded software solutions while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for instance while cloudbased solutions present an opportunity for us cloudbased solutions and technologies that deliver technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell in addition some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to our customers moreover traditional oems have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers if we are unable to effectively respond to the evolving competitive landscape our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems including our business systems such as our sales customer management financial and accounting marketing purchasing warehouse management ecommerce and mobile systems as well as our operational platforms including voice and data networks and power systems the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

 

the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats both internal and external and human error there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business and results of operations 

breaches of data security and the failure to protect our information technology systems from cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business 

our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers and others in addition we operate data centers for our customers that host their technology infrastructure and may store and transmit both businesscritical data and confidential information in connection with our services business some of our coworkers also have access to our customers’ confidential data and other information we have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however as newer technologies evolve and the portfolio of the service providers we share confidential information with grows we could be exposed to increased risk of breaches in security and other illegal or fraudulent acts including cyberattacks the evolving nature of such threats in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists including computer viruses malware phishing misrepresentation social engineering and forgery are making it increasingly challenging to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks 

 11 

breaches in security could expose us our supply chain our customers or other individuals to significant disruptions a risk of public disclosure loss or misuse of this information security breaches could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation moreover media or other reports of perceived vulnerabilities in our network security or perceived lack of security within our environment even if inaccurate could adversely impact our reputation and materially impact our business the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the failure to comply with our public sector contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things termination fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues from our public sector customers are derived from sales to governmental entities educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services sales to public sector customers are highly regulated noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including the false claims act and the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the us could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public sector customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with governmental entities or other customers in the public sector in addition contracts in the public sector are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization “gpo” or upon default furthermore our inability to enter into or retain contracts with gpos may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those gpos and compete effectively the effect of any of these possible actions could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we fail to provide highquality services to our customers or if our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our service offerings include field services managed services warranties configuration services partner services and telecom services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers we also offer certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers’ businesses this could among other things result in legal claims and proceedings and liability for us moreover as we expand our services and solutions business we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory and other risks we also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation with our customers our brand and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract develop engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business including our key executive management sales services and technical coworkers 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of thomas e richards our chairman and chief executive officer as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers our future success also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our customerfacing coworkers who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with many of our customers in addition as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers for whom the market is extremely competitive 

our inability to attract develop engage and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and adversely affect our ability to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions moreover our inability to train our sales services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel such consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

 12 

the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

while we purchase our products primarily in the markets we serve for example products for us customers are sourced in the us our vendor partners manufacture or purchase a significant portion of the products we sell outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events that could also cause disruptions to our supply chain include 

 we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell are purchased or manufactured or may be purchased or manufactured in the future will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargoes sanctions safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell as well as foreign labor strikes and work stoppages or boycotts could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition our exports are subject to regulations some of which may be inconsistent and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business 

we have two warehouse and distribution facilities in the us and one in the uk if the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence we could utilize another distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate three customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

increases in the cost of commercial delivery services or disruptions of those services could adversely impact our business 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes inclement weather natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales typically on 30day payment terms we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty or in the case of public sector customers during periods of budget constraints 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by 

 13 

our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request these bulk purchases could increase our exposure to inventory obsolescence 

we could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may continue to pursue transactions including strategic investments acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous business risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses there can be no assurance that the intended benefits of our investments acquisitions and alliances will be realized or that those benefits will offset these numerous risks or other unforeseen factors any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly which may result in volatility in the market price of our stock and could impact our ability to operate our business effectively 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades 

our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including general macroeconomic conditions pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our reported results of operations 

our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements while our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our international subsidiaries particularly the british pound and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in our reported results of operations we also have foreign currency exposure to the extent sales and purchases are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits which may result in substantial costs and expenses or interruption of our normal business operations 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial employment tort and other litigation 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services in the form of ceaseanddesist letters licensing inquiries lawsuits and other communications and demands in our industry such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased increasingly many of these assertions are brought by nonpracticing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue but we may also be subject to demands from inventors competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue lost profits andor an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities including selling certain products or services 

 14 

we also are subject to proceedings investigations and audits by federal state international national provincial and local authorities including because of our significant sales to governmental entities we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts 

current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

failure to comply with complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to numerous complex us and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas including areas of labor and employment advertising ecommerce tax import and export requirements anticorruption data privacy requirements including those under the european union general data protection regulation anticompetition and environmental health and safety the evaluation of and compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and these laws and regulations may have other adverse impacts on our business results of operations or cash flows for example the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was signed into law in the fourth quarter of 2017 making significant changes to the us internal revenue code while we have estimated the income tax effects of the act in our consolidated financial statements we continue to analyze the income tax effects of the act as well as to monitor tax and accounting guidance issued by various authorities which could result in material changes as we refine those estimates   furthermore the laws and regulations to which the company is subject are evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business and the risk of noncompliance 

we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no guarantee against coworkers contractors or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures 

as a public company we also are subject to increasingly complex public disclosure corporate governance and accounting requirements that increase compliance costs and require significant management focus 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have important consequences to our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2017  we had 32 billion  of total longterm debt outstanding as defined by gaap and 498 million  of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements and the ability to borrow an additional 996 million  under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit loan facility the “revolving loan” and an additional £ 50 million   68 million  at december 31 2017  under our cdw uk revolving credit facility our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 



 15 

 restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs a breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities the lenders 

 the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures 

if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior credit facilities if the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness even if we were able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us 

in addition under our revolving loan we are permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of up to 15 billion however our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition the borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors’ eligible accounts receivable net of accounts reserves up to 30 of such eligible accounts receivable which can consist of federal government accounts receivable plus the lesser of i 75 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors’ eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves and ii the product of 85 multiplied by the net orderly liquidation value percentage multiplied by eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves less reserves other than accounts reserves and inventory reserves the borrowing base in effect as of december 31 2017  was 16 billion  and therefore did not restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving loan as of that date 

our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is also limited by a minimum liquidity condition which provides that if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of i 125 million and ii the greater of a 10 of the borrowing base and b 

 16 

100 million the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under our revolving loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving loan is at least 100 to 100 it is an event of default under our revolving loan if our excess cash availability and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio remain below such levels for a period of five or more consecutive business days moreover our revolving loan provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability reserves which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us we cannot assure you that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or were it to do so that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity 

we will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and if not successful we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control our outstanding longterm debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us and accordingly we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” included elsewhere in this report 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or revise or delay our strategic plan we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements including our senior credit facilities and indentures in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations our senior credit facilities restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result 

 despite our indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt including secured debt this could further increase the risks associated with our leverage 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above including our possible inability to service our debt will increase as of december 31 2017  we had 996 million  available for additional borrowing under our revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations net of 1 million  of issued and undrawn letters of credit and 454 million  of reserves related to our floorplan subfacility and an additional £ 50 million   68 million  at december 31 2017  available under our cdw uk revolving credit facility 

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2017  we had 15 billion  of variable rate debt outstanding if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate cap agreements in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock which may be caused by a number of factors many of which we cannot control including the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and the following 

 in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies including companies in our industry in the past securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility if we were involved in securities litigation we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business 

in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our thenoutstanding shares of our common stock and depress our stock price 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors these provisions 

 our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15 of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company even if doing 

 18 

so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on or make share repurchases of our common stock if we do not continue to pay dividends you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price 

we expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock currently at the rate of 021  per share per quarter or 084  per share per annum however any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors any determination to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions any potential indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors our board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will repurchase shares of our common stock if we do not pay dividends in the future realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur 

we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 

we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us the deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2017  we owned or leased a total of 23 million  square feet of space primarily in the us canada and uk we own two properties a 513000 square foot distribution center in north las vegas nevada and a combined office and a 442000 square foot distribution center in vernon hills illinois in addition we conduct sales services and administrative activities in various leased locations primarily in the us canada and uk including data centers in madison wisconsin minneapolis minnesota and the uk 

we believe our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability leases covering our currently occupied leased properties expire at varying dates generally within the next ten years we anticipate no difficulty in retaining occupancy through lease renewals monthtomonth occupancy or replacing the leased properties with equivalent properties we believe that suitable additional or substitute leased properties will be available as required 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial intellectual property employment tort and other litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state international national provincial and local authorities and by various partners group purchasing organizations and customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the us in such cases certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

as of december 31 2017  we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters if any has been incurred however the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable as such our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters 

 19 

on october 29 2015 the company learned of an investigation by the sec of the company’s vendor partner program incentives on may 19 2017 the sec staff informed the company that the sec has concluded its investigation and does not intend to recommend an enforcement action the investigation did not have any impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations other than customary costs related to the company’s cooperation with the investigation

overview 

cdw corporation is a fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated it solutions to small medium and large business and government education and healthcare customers in the us the uk and canada our broad array of offerings 

ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated it solutions such as mobility security data center optimization cloud computing virtualization and collaboration

in august 2015 we acquired cdw uk which enhanced our ability to provide it solutions to us based customers with multinational locations it also extended our footprint into the united kingdom financial results of cdw uk are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

we have three reportable segments corporate small business and public our corporate segment primarily serves private sector business customers with more than 250 employees our small business segment primarily serves private sector business customers with up to 250 employees our public segment is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the us we also have two other operating segments canada and cdw uk each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and accordingly are included in an all other category “other” 

we may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions which may include one or more of the following product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements we also resell software for major software publishers our agreements with software publishers allow the enduser customer to acquire 

 29 

software or licensed products and services in addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs we help them manage their software agreements including warranties and renewals a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners these programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time 

trends and key factors affecting our financial performance 

we believe the following trends and key factors may have an important impact on our financial performance 



key business metrics 

we monitor a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin net income nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income net income per common share nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin free cash flow return on working capital cash and cash equivalents net working capital cash conversion cycle defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios sales per coworker and coworker turnover these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management so that actions can be taken as necessary in order to achieve the standards and objectives 

 30 

in this form 10k we discuss nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin which are nongaap financial measures 

we believe these measures provide analysts investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance management uses these measures to evaluate periodoverperiod performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business additionally adjusted ebitda is a measure in the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility “term loan” which is used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments incur additional debt and make restricted payments such as dividends and share repurchases as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments for further details regarding the term loan see longterm debt and financing arrangements within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 10   longterm debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the definitions of nongaap income before income taxes nongaap net income and adjusted ebitda and reconciliations to net income see “results of operations” 

the results of certain key business metrics are as follows

for the year ended december 31 2017  sales growth was driven by gains in all our customer markets except healthcare which saw a net sales decline year over year during the year and in contrast to 2016 we saw an acceleration of hardware sales driven by strong growth within client device sales due to customer refresh which impacted categories such as notebooks mobile devices and desktops additionally we saw growth in several other categories including video and networking we also saw ongoing customer focus on designing it securely which led to strong sales growth across our entire security portfolio and the adoption of more efficient architectures which drove strong growth in hyperconverged infrastructure and solutions delivered via the cloud as well as the continuing trend of greater integration of software into solutions 

corporate segment net sales in 2017   increased   457 million  or 78  compared to 2016  as customer confidence improved throughout the year growth was primarily driven by customer refresh of client devices and networking 

small business segment net sales in 2017   increased  by 106 million or 93  compared to 2016  sales growth was primarily driven by customer refresh of client devices and video 

public segment net sales in 2017   increased   448 million  or 80  compared to 2016  the growth was primarily driven by government and education customers net sales to federal government customers reflected a focus on spending existing budgets on planned projects and ongoing successful alignment with strategic programs as well as success meeting the department of defense mandated move to new client devices with stronger security features strong net sales to our state and local government customers was driven by a continued focus on public safety and the ongoing success executing against recently added contracts net sales to our higher education customers were driven by networking and software as we continued to see the benefit from “connected campus” strategies to ensure network infrastructures can handle multiple devices used by students faculty and visitors across the entire campus k12 growth was driven by success in delivering collaborative learning environments and networking net sales to healthcare customers decreased   29  reflecting continued customer uncertainty related to reimbursements and funding 

net sales in other for 2017   increased   198 million  or 145  compared to 2016  other is comprised of results from our canadian and uk operations both operations had strong growth in local currency as we continued to take share in the local markets as well as the benefit from increased sales for referrals from us customers to the uk the impact of foreign currency exchange decreased other sales growth by approximately 250 basis points due to the impact resulting from the british pound to us dollar translation partially offset by favorable translation of the canadian to us dollar 

gross profit 

gross profit increased   123 million  or 53  to 2450 million  in 2017  compared to 2327 million  in 2016  as a percentage of net sales gross profit decreased   50  basis points to 161  in 2017  down  from 166  in 2016  although there was an increase in gross profit due to higher sales volumes we experienced a decline in our gross profit margin this decline was primarily driven by product margin compression due to increased hardware sales which generally have lower profit margins and an ongoing competitive marketplace 

gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix net service contract revenue commission revenue pricing strategies market conditions and other factors 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased   65 million  or 48  to 1410 million  in 2017  compared to 1345 million  in 2016  this was driven by higher sales payroll costs including sales commissions year over year primarily due to higher gross profit as well as higher coworker costs between years consistent with increased coworker count total coworker count was 8726  at december 31 2017  up   210  from 8516  at december 31 2016  additionally equitybased compensation expense and the associated payroll taxes increased   8 million  or 198  during 2017 compared to 2016  primarily due to the impact of annual equity awards granted under our longterm incentive plan and the vesting of an equity grant made at the time of our initial public offering also during 2017  a retroactive illinois state law change was enacted which required the reinstatement of unclaimed property balances resulting in an additional 4 million  of expenses these increases were partially offset by lower senior management incentive compensation 

as a percentage of total net sales selling and administrative expenses decreased   30 basis points to 93 in 2017  down  from 96 in 2016

 not meaningful 

 income from operations was 866 million  in 2017  an increase  of 47 million  or 57  compared to 819 million  in 2016  although income from operations increased total operating margin percentage decreased   20  basis points to 57  in 2017  from 59  in 2016  the decrease was primarily due to gross profit margin compression from higher hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace also contributing to lower operating margin percentage was the reinstatement of prior year unclaimed property balances in 2017 and the nonrecurrence of the settlement payments received from the dynamic random access memory class action lawsuits in 2016 partially offsetting these decreases were lower sales payroll consistent with our variable compensation cost structure lower senior management incentive compensation and a decline in intangible asset amortization expense as a percentage of net sales 

corporate segment income from operations was 487 million  in 2017  an increase  of 33 million  or 74  compared to 454 million  in 2016  corporate segment operating margin remained flat at   77  for 2017  and 2016  although income from operations increased primarily due to an increase in sales volume corporate segment operating margin percentage remained flat  the flat operating margin percentage reflects higher hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace which were fully offset by lower sales payroll expenses 

small business segment income from operations was 74 million  in 2017  an increase  of 5 million or 80  compared to 69 million  in 2016  income from operations increased due to an increase in sales volume while operating margin remained flat at 60  for 2017  and 2016  the flat operating margin percentage reflects higher hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace which were fully offset by lower sales payroll expenses 

public segment income from operations was 374 million  in 2017  an increase  of 6 million  or 16  compared to 368 million  in 2016  public segment operating margin decreased   40  basis points to 62  in 2017  from 66  in 2016  this decrease in operating margin percentage was primarily driven by higher hardware sales which were partially offset by lower sales payroll expenses 

other income from operations was 58 million  in 2017  an increase  of 14 million  or 328  compared to 44 million  in 2016  other income from operations increased primarily due to higher sales volumes and gross profit as we continue to take share in the local markets other operating margin percentage increased   50  basis points to 37  in 2017  from 32  in 2016  this increase was primarily driven by a decline in intangible asset amortization expense as a percentage of net sales

interest expense net 

net interest expense in 2017  was 151 million  an increase  of 4 million  compared to 147 million  in 2016  this increase  was primarily driven by marktomarket gains recognized on our interest rate cap agreements in 2016 with no comparable activity in 2017 due to the election of hedge accounting in february 2017 and by a rising interest rate environment which resulted in higher interest expense on the term loan this was partially offset by a reduced coupon rate due to the refinancing activity that occurred during 2017 

net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt 

for information regarding our debt see note 10   longterm debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements during 2017  we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt of 57 million  compared to 2 million  in 2016

income tax expense 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted into law the tax cuts and jobs act changes several aspects of us federal tax law including reducing the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning on january 1 2018 establishing a territorial tax system which includes a onetime tax on the deemed mandatory repatriation of our international operations’ unremitted earnings which have not been subject to us tax imposing a minimum us tax on foreign earnings providing for the immediate expensing of certain qualified property and changing the tax treatment of performance based executive compensation and certain employee fringe benefits gaap requires the income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act to be accounted for in the period of enactment 

the sec issued staff accounting bulletin 118 allowing for provisional amounts to be recorded during a measurement period not to exceed one year we recorded provisional amounts for the impact of revaluing deferred tax assets and liabilities the deemed mandatory repatriation tax of our international operations’ unremitted earnings and the state income tax effects from the change in federal tax law we continue to analyze the income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act as well as monitor guidance from the internal revenue service and the us treasury department any additional income tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act are expected to be recorded within the measurement period 

income tax expense was 137 million  in 2017  compared to 248 million  in 2016  the effective income tax rate expressed by calculating income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was 208  and 369  for 2017  and 2016  respectively we expect to have an effective tax rate of between 24 and 25 in 2018 the 2018 effective tax rate may change due to various factors including adjustments we make to the estimates of the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act that were recorded as of december 31 2017 as well as additional guidance that the internal revenue service us treasury department and state taxing authorities may issue changes in the estimated excess tax benefits due to the changes in the market value of our common stock and changes in the number of awards vesting and changes in state tax laws 

 35 

for 2017  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a onetime benefit of 96 million to reflect the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities excess tax benefits on equity compensation and lower corporate tax rates on our international income partially offset by state income taxes and a onetime charge of 20 million for the mandatory repatriation tax for 2016  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and nondeductible meals and entertainment expenses which were partially offset by lower corporate tax rates on our international income a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the uk and excess tax benefits on equitybased compensation as a result of adopting asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation the lower effective tax rate for 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily attributable to the impact of revaluing deferred tax assets and liabilities and excess tax benefits on equity compensation offset by a onetime charge for the mandatory repatriation tax

 total net sales in 2016  increased 993 million  or 76  to 13982 million  compared to 12989 million in 2015  reflecting both solid organic increases and the inclusion of seven months of incremental cdw uk sales total net sales increased 83 on a constant currency basis there were five key trends that impacted our net sales growth first customers were seeking to optimize their infrastructure by extending asset lives or adding capacity which led to increases in warranties and virtualization software second customer focus on designing it securely continued to be a major area of interest for customers and we saw excellent increases across our entire security portfolio including security software we also saw our customers seeking architectures to increase the flexibility and efficiency of their it infrastructure which drove increased adoption of cloud solutions for certain workloads including security as well as increased sales of hyperconverged infrastructure fourth we saw the ongoing trend where a greater proportion of solutions are being delivered via software with software becoming more “mission critical” customers continued to turn to software assurance to protect their investment finally customer demand for digital signage and video screens as well as notebookmobile devices drove growth across all of our customer endmarkets 

corporate segment net sales in 2016 increased 11 million  or 02  year over year as customer demand for longer tail purchases including data center and networking solutions was impacted by slow economic growth and market trends corporate had strong sales performance in notebookmobile devices and software products 

economic conditions had less of an impact on small business results as net sales to small business customers increased by 51 million  or 46  between periods driven by growth in notebooksmobile devices desktops and video projection hardware 

public segment net sales in 2016 increased 406 million  or 78  between years net sales to government customers increased 163 million  or 96  state and local government customers continued to focus on public safety and we benefited from new contracts our federal channel saw low singledigit growth as the success we had meeting new strategic programs was partially offset by the impact of several large client device purchase orders that were delayed into 2017 net sales to education customers increased 199 million  or 110  year over year driven by continued success providing client devices to support digital testing and curriculums as well as desktops and video projection hardware to support new learning environments for students healthcare growth was 26  or 43 million  driven by notebooksmobile devices desktops and software patient data security continues to be a top concern we continued to see some of our larger customers shifting priorities to reducing costs due to industry consolidation 

net sales in other which is comprised of our canadian and cdw uk operations increased 526 million  or 628  compared to 2015  the increase in net sales was primarily driven by the impact of consolidating twelve months of cdw uk net sales in 2016 compared to consolidating five months of cdw uk results in 2015  both our canadian and uk businesses grew

gross profit margin was positively impacted by a higher mix of net service contract revenue as customers looked to extend the life of equipment through warranties protect their software investments through software assurance and adopt cloud solutions to deliver certain workloads all of these solutions grew faster than our overall net sales in addition vendor partner funding positively impacted gross margin these increases helped offset the impact from unfavorable product margin

seasonality 

while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year sales in our corporate segment which primarily serves private sector business customers with more than 250 employees are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year additionally sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers 

liquidity and capital resources

 in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs we monitor our cash conversion cycle defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows 



 the cash conversion cycle was 19  days at december 31 2017 and 2016  the increase in dso was primarily driven by higher net sales and related accounts receivable for thirdparty services such as saas software assurance and warranties these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the consolidated statement of operations is recorded on a net basis this also results in a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sales in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales in addition dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms 

the cash conversion cycle was 19 and 21 days at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase in dso was primarily driven by higher net sales and related accounts receivable for thirdparty services such as saas software assurance and warranties these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the statement of operations is recorded on a net basis these services have a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sale in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales in addition to the impact of these services on dpo dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased   15 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  capital expenditures increased 17 million  to 81 million  from 64 million  for 2017  and 2016  respectively primarily related to improvements to our information technology systems 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 289 million in 2016 compared to 2015 the decrease in cash used was primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of cdw uk in 2015 additionally capital expenditures decreased 26 million to 64 million from 90 million for 2016 and 2015 respectively primarily due to spending for our new office location in 2015 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased   514 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  the increase was primarily driven by changes in accounts payableinventory financing which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of 228 million  and by share repurchases during 2017  which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of 167 million  for more information on our share repurchase program see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” the increase in cash used for accounts payableinventory financing was primarily driven by the termination of one of our inventory financing agreements in the fourth quarter of 2016 with amounts 

 49 

owed subsequently reported as accounts payable  trade on the consolidated balance sheet which reduced cash flows reported as financing activities during 2017 in addition an increase in incentive compensation plan tax withholdings paid of 50 million  coupled with an increase in dividends paid of 28 million  contributed to the increase in cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased 78 million in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase was primarily driven by higher share repurchases during the year ended december 31 2016 which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of 126 million the increase was partially offset by the changes in accounts payableinventory financing which resulted in an increase in cash provided for financing activities of 48 million the increase in cash provided by accounts payableinventory financing was primarily due to a new vendor added to our previously existing inventory financing agreement for a description of the inventory financing transactions impacting each period see note 7 inventory financing agreements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase program see item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities”

for additional details regarding our debt and refinancing activities refer to note 10   longterm debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

inventory financing agreements 

we have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions these amounts are classified separately as accounts payableinventory financing on the consolidated balance sheets we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due for further details see note 7   inventory financing agreements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

inflation 

inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results we generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing we also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements and by accelerating our overall cash conversion cycle there can be no assurances however that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources these estimates have not historically required significant management judgment our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates nor have we historically made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates 

in note 1   description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers including oems software publishers and wholesale distributors we record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale delivery has occurred andor services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our shipping terms typically specify fob destination at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

revenues from the sales of hardware products and software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales these items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways including i as physical product shipped from our warehouse ii via dropshipment by the vendor or supplier or iii via electronic delivery for software licenses at the time of sale we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience our vendor partners warrant most of the products we sell 

we leverage dropshipment arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs we recognize revenue for dropshipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify fob destination we recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer we set the price of the product charged to the customer we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced and we work closely with our customers to determine their 

 51 

hardware and software specifications these arrangements represent approximately 50 of total net sales of which approximately 25 relate to electronic delivery for software licenses 

revenue from professional services is recognized in either of two ways services as an hourly rate recognized using a percentage of completion model or a fixed fee recognized using a proportional performance model for the fixed fee revenues for cloud computing solutions including saas and iaas arrangements with one time invoicing to the customer are recognized at the time of invoice revenues for data center services such as managed and remote managed services server colocation internet connectivity data backup and storage and saas and iaas arrangements where the customer is invoiced over time are recognized over the period service is provided 

we also sell certain products for which we act as an agent products in this category include the sale of thirdparty services warranties software assurance “sa” and thirdparty hosted saas and iaas arrangements sa is a product that allows customers to upgrade at no additional cost to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the sa is in effect these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale under net sales recognition the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 

our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements “eas” under eas customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year regardless of changes to their employee base customers are charged an annual trueup fee for changes in the number of users over the year with most eas our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount in certain instances we bill the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer 

we also sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of the products and services for each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element the allocated arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above selling prices are determined by using vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists otherwise selling prices are determined using third party evidence “tpe” if neither vsoe or tpe is available we use our best estimate of selling prices 

we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a cost of sales 

deferred revenue includes 1 payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services and 2 amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met   

we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales intransit to customers at the end of each period based on a weightedaverage analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes dropshipment arrangements this analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount of  sales intransit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been received by the customer changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period 

vendor programs 

we receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates bid programs price protection and other programs these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory depending on the nature of the incentive vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs which could have an impact on our results of operations 

we record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets if actual performance does not match our estimates we may be required to adjust our receivables we record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors’ inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims however if actual collections differ from our estimates we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross profit and income from operations 

goodwill 

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of goodwill utilizing either a quantitative or qualitative impairment test a qualitative assessment is performed on at least an annual basis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying 

 52 

value we perform a quantitative impairment test for each reporting unit every three years or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment the annual test for impairment is conducted as of december 1 our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments 

under a quantitative assessment goodwill impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach 75 and a market approach 25 as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants 

under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit are based on internally generated forecasts for the remainder of the respective reporting period and the next five years we use a range of 2035 longterm assumed consolidated annual net sales growth rate for periods after the terminal year 

under the market approach we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for guideline companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company the valuation multiples are applied to the reporting units 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including net sales growth rates gross margins operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others any changes in the judgments estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results 

under a qualitative assessment the most recent quantitative assessment is the starting point to determine if it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value as part of this qualitative assessment we assess relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance changes in share price and entityspecific events 

2017 impairment analysis 

we completed our annual impairment analysis as of december 1 2017  for the corporate small business and uk reporting units we performed a qualitative analysis we determined that it was morelikelythannot that the individual fair values of the corporate small business and uk reporting units exceeded the individual carrying values and therefore a quantitative impairment analysis was deemed unnecessary although uncertainty regarding the impact of brexit still exists in the current year we do not believe there to be any additional risk that would indicate the quantitative analysis performed in the prior year to have different results therefore a qualitative analysis was deemed appropriate for the uk reporting unit we performed a quantitative analysis of the public and canada reporting units based on the results of the quantitative analysis we determined that the fair value of the public and canada reporting units exceeded their carrying values by 179  and 153  respectively and no impairment existed we identified that the most sensitive assumptions used in the quantitative analysis were net sales growth and ebitda margin and although we believe our assumptions are reasonable based on current market conditions actual results may vary significantly and could expose us to impairment charges in the future 

with the establishment of small business as its own reporting unit we performed a quantitative analysis in order to allocate goodwill between corporate and small business based on the results of the quantitative analysis performed as of january 1 2017 we determined that the fair values of corporate and small business reporting units exceeded their carrying values by 227  and 308  respectively and no impairment existed 

2016 impairment analysis 

we completed our annual impairment analysis as of december 1 2016 for the corporate which as of december 1 2016 included small business public and canada reporting units we performed a qualitative analysis we determined that it was morelikelythannot that the individual fair values of the corporate public and canada reporting units exceeded the individual carrying values and therefore a quantitative impairment analysis was deemed unnecessary due to the substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of brexit we performed a quantitative analysis of the cdw uk reporting unit based on the results of the quantitative analysis we determined that the fair value of the cdw uk reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 16 and no impairment existed we identified that the most sensitive assumptions used in the quantitative analysis were net sales growth and ebitda margin and although we believe our assumptions are reasonable based on current market conditions actual results may vary significantly and could expose us to impairment charges in the future

intangible assets 

intangible assets include customer relationships trade names internally developed software and other intangibles intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life these intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value in addition each quarter we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each of these intangible assets if we were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 

during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  we concluded our intangible assets with finite lives were not impaired and no changes to the remaining useful lives were necessary 

income taxes 

deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis this evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

we account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

the tax cuts and jobs act contains a provision which subjects a us parent of a foreign subsidiary to current us tax on its global intangible lowtax income “gilti” the gilti income is eligible for a deduction which lowers the effective tax rate to 105 for taxable years 2018 through 2025 and 13125 after 2025 as we continue to evaluate our accounting policy with respect to gilti the provisional estimates were reported on the basis that gilti will be accounted for as a period cost when incurred accordingly we are not providing deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as gilti

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks 

interest rate risk 

our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates the interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility our senior secured term loan facility and the cdw uk term loan are floating and therefore are subject to fluctuations in order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility we have entered into interest rate caps to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2017  we have interest rate cap agreements in effect through december 31 2018 with a combined notional amount of 14 billion which entitle us to payments from the counterparty of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 15 during the agreement period 

for additional details see note 10   longterm debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations” for information on cash flows interest rates and maturity dates of our debt obligations 

foreign currency risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies other than the us dollar primarily the canadian dollar and the british pound which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations revenue and expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currencies of the corresponding countries the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the same as the corresponding local currency upon consolidation as results of operations are translated operating results may differ from expectations the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has not been material as the majority of our results of operations are denominated in us dollars

in 2016  we generated over 1 billion of net sales from each of four of our vendor partners and over 100 million of revenue from each of thirteen other vendor partners in late 2015 we expanded our partnership with dell and now provide their entire suite of products and services across all of our customer channels we have received the highest level of certification from major vendor partners such as cisco dell emc hewlett packard enterprise and microsoft which reflects the extensive product and solution knowledge and capabilities that we bring to our customers’ it challenges these certifications also provide us with access to favorable pricing tools and resources including vendor incentive programs which we use to provide additional value to our customers our vendor partners also regularly recognize us with top awards and select us to develop and grow new customer solutions 

product procurement 

we may purchase all or only some of the products our vendor partners offer for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions which may include one or more of the following product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements we also purchase software from major software publishers and cloud providers for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer our agreements allow the enduser customer to acquire cloudbased solutions software or licensed products and services 

in addition to purchasing products directly from our vendor partners we purchase products from wholesale distributors for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer these wholesale distributors provide logistics management and supplychain services for us as well as for our vendor partners 

for our us operations we purchased approximately 50  of the products we sold as discrete products or as components of a solution directly from our vendor partners and the remaining 50 from wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2016  purchases from our three largest wholesale distributors tech data synnex and ingram micro are each approximately 10 of total purchases 

inventory management 

we operate two distribution centers in north america a 450000 square foot facility in vernon hills illinois and a 513000 square foot facility in north las vegas nevada we also operate a 120000 square foot distribution center in rugby warwickshire uk we ship over 40 million  units annually on an aggregate basis from our distribution centers 

 5 

we also have dropshipment arrangements with many of our oems and wholesale distributors which permit us to offer products to our customers without having to take physical delivery at our distribution centers these arrangements generally represent approximately 45 to 55 of total consolidated net sales of which approximately 20 to 30 relate to electronic delivery for software licenses 

we believe that the location of our distribution centers allows us efficiently ship products to our customers and provide timely access to our principal distributors 

we believe competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of the product categories that we offer 

competition 

the market for technology products and services is highly competitive and subject to economic conditions and rapid technological changes competition is based on many things including the ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs the quality and breadth of product and service offerings knowledge and expertise of sales force customer service price product availability speed of delivery and credit availability we face competition from resellers direct manufacturers large service providers cloud providers telecommunication companies and to a lesser extent etailers and retailers smaller local or regional value added resellers typically focus on a single solution suite or portfolio of solutions from one or two vendors partners 

we believe we are well positioned to compete within this marketplace due to our competitive advantages we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to evolve as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for a discussion of the risks associated with competition see item 1a “risk factors” 

our competitive advantages 

we believe we have sustainable competitive advantages that differentiate us in the marketplace we have built a strong sales organization and deep services and solutions capabilities over time and expect to continue to invest in coworkers to enhance these capabilities which we believe when combined with our competitive advantages of scale and a performance driven culture will help drive sustainable profitable growth for us today and in the future our scale enables us to have a national and international footprint as well invest in resources to meet specific customer endmarket needs our sellers are organized around unique customer endmarkets that are both vertically and geographically focused our scale enables our ability to invest in technical coworkers who work directly with our sellers to help customers implement increasingly complex it solutions our scale also enables us to operate our three distribution centers two in the us and one in the uk which combined are more than 1 million square feet in size with the acquisition of cdw uk in 2015 we have crossborder relationships that enable us to serve the needs of our us uk and canadianbased customers in more than 80 countries our strong executionoriented culture is underpinned by our compensation system 

our offerings 

our offerings range from discrete hardware and software products and services to complex integrated solutions including one or more of these elements we believe our customers increasingly view technology purchases as integrated solutions rather than discrete product and service categories we estimate that approximately 50 of our net sales in 2016  in the us came from sales of product categories and services typically associated with solutions our hardware products include notebooksmobile devices including tablets network communications enterprise and data storage video monitors printers desktop computers and servers our software products include application suites security virtualization operating systems and network management our services include warranties managed services consulting design and implementation 

today it is critical to both “run the business” and drive greater growth and productivity to help our customers accomplish this we have built a robust portfolio of solutions across data center digital workspace security virtualization and services that we provide in physical virtual or cloudbased environments 

we provide public cloud solutions which reside off customer premises on a public shared infrastructure and private cloud solutions which reside on customer premises we also offer hybrid cloud solutions that deliver the benefits of both public and private solutions our migration integration and managed services offerings help our customers simplify cloud adoption as well as the ongoing management of cloud solutions across the entire it lifecycle dedicated cloud client executives work with our customers to architect cloud solutions meeting their organizational technology and financial objectives these offerings are underpinned by our 24 by 7 network operating centers as well as services that include cloud planning services and managed cloud all of these investments help our customers maximize the return on their it investments

we offer a broad portfolio of integrated solutions that include the following on and offpremise capabilities 

 although we believe customers increasingly view technology purchases as solutions rather than discrete product and service categories our net sales by major category based upon our internal category classifications was as follow

 our internal capabilities 

our coworkers 

as of december 31 2016 we employed 8516 coworkers with approximately 7500 coworkers in north america and 1000 in the united kingdom approximately two thirds of our coworkers at yearend 2016 were customer facing over fifty percent of our net sales are generated by account managers who have greater than seven years of experience account managers are supported by field sellers highly skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers we believe this structure to be core to our ability to continue to offer complex it solutions and services 

none of our coworkers are covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our coworker relations to be good 

marketing 

we market the cdw brand to us canadian and british audiences using a variety of channels that include online broadcast print social and other media we market to current and prospective customers through integrated marketing programs including behaviorally targeted email print online media events and sponsorships as well as broadcast media this promotion is also supported by integrated communication efforts targeting decisionmakers influencers and the general public using a combination of news releases case studies media interviews and speaking opportunities 

as a result of our relationships with our vendor partners a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs these programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time we believe that our results and analytical techniques that measure the efficacy of our marketing programs differentiate us from our competitors 

information technology systems 

we maintain customized it and unified communication systems that enhance our ability to provide prompt efficient and expert service to our customers in addition these systems enable centralized management of key functions including purchasing inventory management billing and collection of accounts receivable sales and distribution our systems provide us with thorough detailed and realtime information regarding key aspects of our business this capability helps us to continuously enhance productivity ship customer orders quickly and efficiently respond appropriately to industry changes and provide high levels of customer service we believe our websites which provide electronic order processing and advanced tools such as order tracking reporting and asset management make it easy for customers to transact business with us and ultimately strengthen our customer relationships

history 

founded in 1984 cdw became a public company in 1993 in 2003 we purchased selected united states assets and the canadian operations of micro warehouse which extended our growth platform into canada in 2006 we acquired berbee information networks corporation a regional provider of technology products solutions and customized engineering services in advanced technologies primarily across cisco ibm and microsoft portfolios this acquisition increased our capabilities in customized engineering services and managed services 

we were a public company from 1993 until october 12 2007 when we were acquired through a merger transaction by an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with madison dearborn partners llc “madison dearborn” and providence equity partners llc “providence equity” cdw corporation continued as the surviving corporation and same legal entity after the acquisition but became a wholly owned subsidiary of vh holdings inc a delaware corporation 

on july 2 2013 cdw corporation completed the ipo of its common stock in connection with the ipo cdw holdings distributed all of its shares of cdw corporation’s common stock to its members in june 2013 in accordance with the members’ respective membership interests and was subsequently dissolved in august 2013 see note 10 stockholders’ equity to the

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some important factors that may cause our business prospects results of operations and cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our business 

global and regional economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business 

weak economic conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions government spending cuts and the impact of new government policies or a tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows for example there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the economic impact of the referendum on the united kingdom’s membership of the european union “eu” referred to as “brexit” advising for the exit of the uk from the eu potential adverse consequences of brexit such as global market uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates greater restrictions on imports and exports between uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public sector customers 

our sales to our public sector customers are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels an adverse change in government spending policies including ongoing budget cuts at the federal level budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public sector customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows for example in 2013 as a result of sequestration and related budget uncertainty and the partial shutdown of the us federal government for 16 days we experienced significantly reduced us federal sales in our public segment 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products 

we purchase products for resale from vendor partners which include oems and software publishers and wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2016  we purchased approximately 50  of the products we sold directly from vendor partners and the remaining amount from wholesale distributors for our north american operations we are authorized by vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding including purchase rebates sales volume rebates purchasing 

 9 

incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows in addition a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows particularly given our substantial indebtedness 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2016  products we purchased from wholesale distributors ingram micro synnex and tech data each represented approximately 10 of total us purchases in addition sales of products manufactured by apple cisco dell emc hewlett packard enterprise hp inc lenovo and microsoft whether purchased directly from these vendor partners or from a wholesale distributor represented in the aggregate nearly 60  of our 2016  consolidated net sales sales of products manufactured by cisco and hp inc represented over 25 of our 2016 consolidated net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other key vendor partners or the diminished availability of their products including due to backlogs for their products leading to manufacturer allocation could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position 

additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows further the sale spinoff or combination of any of our vendor partners andor certain of their business units including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services offerings such as cloudbased solutions including software as a service “saas” infrastructure as a service “iaas” and platform as a service “paas” and the internet of things “iot” we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services offerings as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers also customers may delay spending while they evaluate new technologies a decrease in the rate of innovation or the lack of acceptance of innovations or delays in technology spending by customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware software and services offerings for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels in addition our success is dependent on our ability to develop relationships with and sell hardware software and services from new emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace to the extent that a vendor’s offering that is highly in demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels or we are unable to develop relationships with new technology providers or companies that we have not historically represented our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 



 10 

 we expect the competitive landscape to continue to evolve as new technologies are developed such as cloudbased solutions hyperconverged infrastructure and embedded software solutions while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for instance while cloudbased solutions present an opportunity for us cloudbased solutions and technologies that deliver technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell in addition some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to our customers moreover traditional oems have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers if we are unable to effectively respond to the evolving competitive landscape our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems including our business systems such as our sales customer management financial and accounting marketing purchasing warehouse management ecommerce and mobile systems as well as our operational platforms including voice and data networks and power systems the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

 the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats including computer viruses malware phishing social engineering unauthorized access and other malicious attacks both internal and external and human error there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business and results of operations 

breaches of data security could adversely impact our business 

our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers and others in addition we operate data centers for our customers that host their technology infrastructure and may store and transmit both businesscritical data and confidential information in connection with our services business some of our coworkers also have access to our customers’ confidential data and other information we have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however as newer technologies evolve 

 11 

we could be exposed to increased risk of breaches in security breaches in security could expose us our customers or other individuals to a risk of public disclosure loss or misuse of this information resulting in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the failure to comply with our public sector contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things termination fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues from our public sector customers are derived from sales to governmental entities educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services sales to public sector customers are highly regulated noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including the false claims act and the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the united states could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public sector customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with governmental entities or other customers in the public sector in addition contracts in the public sector are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization “gpo” or upon default furthermore our inability to enter into or retain contracts with gpos may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those gpos and compete effectively the effect of any of these possible actions could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we fail to provide highquality services to our customers or if our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our service offerings include field services managed services warranties configuration services partner services and telecom services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers we also offer certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers’ businesses this could among other things result in legal claims and proceedings and liability moreover as we expand our services and solutions business we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory and other risks we also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation with our customers our brand and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract develop engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business including our key executive management sales services and technical coworkers 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of thomas e richards our chairman and chief executive officer as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers our future success also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our customerfacing coworkers who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with many of our customers in addition as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers for whom the market is extremely competitive 

our inability to attract develop engage and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and adversely affect our ability to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions moreover our inability to train our sales services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel such consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

 12 

while we purchase our products primarily in the markets we serve for example products for us customers are sourced in the us our vendor partners manufacture or purchase a significant portion of the products we sell outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events that could also cause disruptions to our supply chain include 

 we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell are purchased or manufactured or may be purchased or manufactured in the future will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargoes sanctions safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell as well as foreign labor strikes and work stoppages or boycotts could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition our exports are subject to regulations some of which may be inconsistent and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business 

we have two warehouse and distribution facilities in the united states and one in the united kingdom if the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence we could utilize another distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate three customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on commercial delivery services 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes inclement weather natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales typically on 30day payment terms we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty or in the case of public sector customers during periods of budget constraints 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request these bulk purchases could increase our exposure to inventory obsolescence 

 13 

we could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may continue to pursue transactions including strategic investments acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous business risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses any of which could adversely affect our operations 

in addition our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades 

our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including general macroeconomic conditions pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our reported results of operations 

our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements while our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our international subsidiaries particularly the british pound and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in our reported results of operations we also have foreign currency exposure to the extent sales and purchases are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial employment tort and other litigation 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services in the form of ceaseanddesist letters licensing inquiries lawsuits and other communications and demands in our industry such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased increasingly many of these assertions are brought by nonpracticing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue but we may also be subject to demands from inventors competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue lost profits andor an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities including selling certain products or services 

we also are subject to proceedings investigations and audits by federal state international national provincial and local authorities including because of our significant sales to governmental entities we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts 

 14 

current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims that we face including the sec’s investigation of our vendor partner program incentives may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

failure to comply with complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to numerous complex us and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas including areas of labor and employment advertising ecommerce tax import and export requirements anticorruption data privacy requirements anticompetition and environmental health and safety compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they are evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business and the risk of noncompliance we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no guarantee against coworkers contractors or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures as a public company we also are subject to increasingly complex public disclosure corporate governance and accounting requirements that increase compliance costs and require significant management focus 

we have significant deferred cancellation of debt income 

as a result of a 2009 debt modification we realized 396 million of cancellation of debt income “codi” we made an election under code section 108i to defer this codi from taxable income pursuant to which we are also required to defer certain original issue discount “oid” deductions as they accrue as of december 31 2013 we had deferred approximately 115 million of oid deductions starting in 2014 we were required to include the deferred codi and the deferred oid into taxable income ratably over a fiveyear period ending in 2018 because we have more codi than the aggregate of our deferred oid on the relevant remaining debt instruments we will have a future cash tax liability associated with our significant deferred codi we have reflected the associated cash tax liability in our deferred taxes for financial accounting purposes 

all of our deferred codi will be accelerated into current taxable income if prior to 2018 we engage in a socalled “impairment transaction” and the gross value of our assets immediately afterward is less than 110 of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred codi and oid the “110 test” as determined under the applicable treasury regulations an “impairment transaction” is any transaction that impairs our ability to pay the tax on our deferred codi and includes dividends or distributions with respect to our equity and charitable contributions in each case in a manner that is not consistent with our historical practice within the meaning of the applicable treasury regulations 

prior to 2018 our willingness to pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our equity could be adversely affected if at the time we do not meet the 110 test and as a result the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution would accelerate the tax payable with respect to our deferred codi we believe that based on our interpretation of applicable treasury regulations the gross value of our assets exceeds 110 of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred codi and oid as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k however we cannot assure you that this will continue to be true in the future 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have important consequences to our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2016  we had 32 billion  of total longterm debt outstanding as defined by gaap and 580 million  of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements and the ability to borrow an additional 716 million  under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit loan facility the “revolving loan” and an additional £ 50 million   62 million  under our cdw uk revolving credit and term loan facility “cdw uk credit facility” our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 



 15 

 restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs a breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities the lenders 

 the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures 

if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior credit facilities if the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness even if we were able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us 

in addition under our revolving loan we are permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of up to 1250 million however our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition the borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors’ eligible accounts receivable net of accounts 

 16 

reserves up to 30 of such eligible accounts receivable which can consist of federal government accounts receivable plus the lesser of i 75 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors’ eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves and ii the product of 85 multiplied by the net orderly liquidation value percentage multiplied by eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves less reserves other than accounts reserves and inventory reserves the borrowing base in effect as of december 31 2016  was 1479 million  and therefore did not restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving loan as of that date 

our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is also limited by a minimum liquidity condition which provides that if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of i 125 million and ii the greater of a 10 of the borrowing base and b 100 million the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under our revolving loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving loan is at least 10 to 10 moreover our revolving loan provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability reserves which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us we cannot assure you that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or were it to do so that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity 

we will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and if not successful we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control our outstanding longterm debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us and accordingly we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” included elsewhere in this report 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or revise or delay our strategic plan we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements including our senior credit facilities and indentures in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations our senior credit facilities restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result 

 despite our indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt including secured debt this could further increase the risks associated with our leverage 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above including our possible inability to service our debt will increase as of december 31 2016  we had 716 million  available for additional borrowing under our revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations net of 1 million  of issued and undrawn letters of credit and 580 million  of reserves related to our floorplan subfacility and an additional £ 50 million   62 million  available under our cdw uk credit facility 

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

 17 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2016  we had 1552 million  of variable rate debt outstanding 1483 million  of which is subject to a 075 libor floor if interest rates increase above 075 per annum our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate cap agreements in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock which may be caused by a number of factors many of which we cannot control including the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and the following 

 in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies including companies in our industry in the past securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility if we were involved in securities litigation we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business 

in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our thenoutstanding shares of our common stock and depress our stock price 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors these provisions 



 18 

 our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15 of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on or make share repurchases of our common stock if we do not continue to pay dividends you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price 

we expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock currently at the rate of 016 per share per quarter or 064 per share per annum however any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors any determination to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions any potential indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors our board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will repurchase shares of our common stock if we do not pay dividends in the future realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur see “risks related to our businesswe have significant deferred cancellation of debt income” for a discussion of certain tax considerations that could affect our willingness to pay dividends in the future  

we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 

we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us the deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2016  we owned or leased a total of 21 million  square feet of space primarily in the us canada and united kingdom we own two properties a combined office and a 442000 square foot distribution center in vernon hills illinois and a 513000 square foot distribution center in north las vegas nevada in addition we conduct sales services and administrative activities in various leased locations primarily in the us canada and united kingdom including data centers in madison wisconsin minneapolis minnesota and the united kingdom 

we believe our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability leases covering our currently occupied leased properties expire at varying dates generally within the next ten years we anticipate no difficulty in retaining occupancy through lease renewals monthtomonth occupancy or replacing the leased properties with equivalent properties we believe that suitable additional or substitute leased properties will be available as required 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial intellectual property employment tort and other litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state international national provincial and local authorities and by various partners group purchasing organizations and customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the united states in such cases 

 19 

certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

on october 29 2015 we learned of an investigation by the sec of our vendor partner program incentives the sec’s investigation is ongoing and we are continuing to cooperate with the sec in this matter 

as of december 31 2016  we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters if any has been incurred however the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable as such our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters

we monitor a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin net income nongaap net income net income per common share nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda free cash flow return on invested capital cash and cash equivalents 

 30 

net working capital cash conversion cycle defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios sales per coworker and coworker turnover these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management so that actions can be taken as necessary in order to achieve the standards and objectives 

nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda are nongaap financial measures 

we believe these measures provide analysts investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance management uses these measures to evaluate periodoverperiod performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business additionally adjusted ebitda is a measure in the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility “term loan” used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments incur additional debt and make restricted payments such as dividends and share repurchases as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments for further details regarding the term loan see longterm debt and financing arrangements within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 8 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the definitions of nongaap net income and adjusted ebitda and reconciliations to net income see “results of operations” 

the results of certain key business metrics are as follows

net sales 

net sales by segment in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  are as follows 



 total net sales in 2016   increased   993 million  or 76  to 13982 million  compared to 12989 million  in 2015  reflecting both solid organic increases and the inclusion of seven months of incremental cdw uk sales total net sales increased 83 on a constant currency basis there were five key trends that impacted our net sales growth first customers were seeking to optimize their infrastructure by extending asset lives or adding capacity which led to increases in warranties and virtualization software second customer focus on designing it securely continued to be a major area of interest for customers and we saw excellent increases across our entire security portfolio including security software we also saw our customers seeking architectures 

 32 

to increase the flexibility and efficiency of their it infrastructure which drove increased adoption of cloud solutions for certain workloads including security as well as increased sales of hyperconverged infrastructure fourth we saw the ongoing trend where a greater proportion of solutions are being delivered via software with software becoming more “mission critical” customers continued to turn to software assurance to protect their investment finally customer demand for digital signage and video screens as well as notebookmobile devices drove growth across all of our customer endmarkets 

corporate segment net sales in 2016   increased   62 million  or 09  compared to 2015  driven by sales growth within the small business customer channel net sales to mediumlarge customers increased   4 million  or 01  year over year as customer demand for longer tail purchases including data center and networking solutions was impacted by slow economic growth and market trends mediumlarge had strong sales performance in notebookmobile devices and software products economic conditions had less of an impact on small business results as net sales to small business customers increased  by 57 million  or 52  between periods driven by growth in notebooksmobile devices desktops and video projection hardware 

public segment net sales in 2016   increased   406 million  or 78  between years net sales to government customers increased   163 million  or 96  state and local government customers continued to focus on public safety and we benefited from new contracts our federal channel saw low singledigit growth as the success we had meeting new strategic programs was partially offset by the impact of several large client device purchase orders that were delayed into 2017 net sales to education customers increased   199 million  or 110  year over year driven by continued success providing client devices to support digital testing and curriculums as well as desktops and video projection hardware to support new learning environments for students healthcare growth was 26  or 43 million  driven by notebooksmobile devices desktops and software patient data security continues to be a top concern we continued to see some of our larger customers shifting priorities to reducing costs due to industry consolidation 

net sales in other which is comprised of our canadian and cdw uk operations increased   526 million  or 628  compared 2015  the increase in net sales was primarily driven by the impact of consolidating twelve months of cdw uk net sales in 2016 compared to consolidating five months of cdw uk results in 2015 both our canadian and uk businesses grew highsingle digits in local currency in 2016 currency was impacted by canadian dollar to us dollar translation in the first half of the year and british pound to us dollar translation in the second half 

gross profit 

gross profit increased   211 million  or 100  to 2327 million  in 2016  compared to 2116 million  in 2015  as a percentage of net sales gross profit increased   30  basis points to 166  in 2016  from 163  in 2015  

gross profit margin was positively impacted 30 basis points by a higher mix of net service contract revenue as customers looked to extend the life of equipment through warranties protect their software investments through software assurance and adopt cloud solutions to deliver certain workloads all of these solutions grew faster than our overall net sales in addition vendor partner funding positively impacted gross margin by 35 basis points these increases helped offset the impact of 30 basis points from unfavorable product margin 

gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix net service contract revenue commission revenue pricing strategies market conditions and other factors 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased   119 million  or 97  to 1345 million  in 2016  compared to 1226 million  in 2015  as a percentage of total net sales selling and administrative expenses increased   20 basis points to 96 in 2016  up  from 94 in 2015  payroll costs increased   65 million  or 117  year over year primarily due to incremental coworker hires at the end of 2015 higher compensation costs consistent with increased gross profit and the inclusion of twelve months of cdw uk payroll costs in 2016 compared to five months in 2015 total coworker count was 8516  at december 31 2016  up 51  from 8465  at december 31 2015  amortization expense related to intangibles increased   18 million  or 88  during 2016 compared to 2015  primarily due to incremental amortization expense related to the intangible assets arising from our acquisition of cdw uk noncash equitybased compensation expense increased   8 million  or 258  during 2016 compared to 2015  primarily due to annual equity awards granted under our 2013 longterm incentive plan performance against longterm incentive program targets and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of cdw uk

interest expense net 

at december 31 2016  our outstanding longterm debt totaled 3234 million  compared to 3260 million  at december 31 2015  a decrease  of 26 million  primarily due to principal payments on the loans net interest expense in 2016  was 147 million  a decrease  of 13 million  compared to 160 million  in 2015  this decrease  was primarily due to the lower effective interest rates and the lower principal loan balances for 2016  compared to 2015  as a result of redemptions and refinancing activities completed during 2016 and 2015 and the impact in 2016 of marktomarket gains associated with our interest rate cap agreements

for 2016  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and nondeductible meals and entertainment expenses which were partially offset by lower corporate tax rates on our international income a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the uk and excess tax benefits on equity compensation as a result of adopting asu 201609 for 2015 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and withholding tax expense on the earnings of our canadian business as a result of no longer asserting permanent reinvestment which was partially offset by a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the uk the lower effective tax rate for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to a larger benefit in 2016 related to our international income which is taxed at lower tax rates than our us income excess tax benefits on equity compensation as a result of adopting asu 201609 in 2016 and less canadian withholding tax expense in 2016 than in 2015 partially offset by a greater deferred tax benefit related to uk tax rate reductions in 2015 than in 2016

 the cash conversion cycle was 19  and 21  days at december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively the increase in dso was primarily driven by higher net sales and related accounts receivable for thirdparty services such as saas software assurance and warranties these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the statement of operations is recorded on a net basis these services have a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sale in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales in addition to the impact of these services on dpo dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms 

the cash conversion cycle remained at 21 days at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the increase in dso was primarily driven by a higher accounts receivable balance at december 31 2015 driven by higher public segment sales where customers generally take longer to pay than customers in our corporate segment slower government payments in certain states due to budget issues and an increase in net sales and related accounts receivable for thirdparty services such as software assurance and warranties these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the statement of operations is recorded on a net basis these services have a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sale in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales in addition to the impact of these services on dpo dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased   289 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the decrease in cash used was primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of cdw uk in 2015 additionally capital expenditures decreased 26 million  to 64 million  from 90 million  for 2016  and 2015  respectively primarily due to spending for our new office location in 2015 

net cash used in investing activities increased 190 million in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase was primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of cdw uk by purchasing the remaining 65 of its outstanding common stock on august 1 2015 additionally capital expenditures increased 35 million to 90 million from 55 million for 2015 and 2014 respectively primarily for our new office location and an increase in spending related to improvements to our information technology systems

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased   78 million  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase was primarily driven by higher share repurchases during the year ended december 31 2016 which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of 126 million  the increase was partially offset by the changes in accounts payableinventory financing which resulted in an increase in cash provided for financing activities of 48 million  the increase in cash provided by accounts payableinventory financing was primarily due to a new vendor added to our previously existing inventory financing agreement for a description of the inventory financing transactions impacting each period see note 6 inventory financing agreements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase program see item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities”

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

inflation 

inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results we generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing we also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements and by accelerating our overall cash conversion cycle there can be no assurances however that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources these estimates have not historically required significant management judgment our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates nor have we historically made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates 

in note 1   description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers including oems software publishers and wholesale distributors we record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale delivery has occurred andor services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our shipping terms typically specify fob destination at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

revenues from the sales of hardware products and software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales these items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways including i as physical product shipped from our warehouse ii via dropshipment by the vendor or supplier or iii via electronic delivery for software licenses at the time of sale we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience our vendor partners warrant most of the products we sell 

 49 

we leverage dropshipment arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs we recognize revenue for dropshipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify fob destination we recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer we set the price of the product charged to the customer we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced and we work closely with our customers to determine their hardware and software specifications these arrangements generally represent approximately 45 to 55 of total net sales which includes approximately 20 to 30 related to electronic delivery for software licenses 

revenue from professional services is recognized in either of two ways services as an hourly rate recognized using a percentage of completion model or a fixed fee recognized using a proportional performance model for the fixed fee revenues for cloud computing solutions including saas and iaas arrangements with one time invoicing to the customer are recognized at the time of invoice revenues for data center services such as managed and remote managed services server colocation internet connectivity data backup and storage and saas and iaas arrangements where the customer is invoiced over time are recognized over the period service is provided 

we also sell certain products for which we act as an agent products in this category include the sale of thirdparty services warranties software assurance “sa” and thirdparty hosted saas and iaas arrangements sa is a product that allows customers to upgrade at no additional cost to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the sa is in effect these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale under net sales recognition the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 

our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements “eas” under eas customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year regardless of changes to their employee base customers are charged an annual trueup fee for changes in the number of users over the year with most eas our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount in certain instances we bill the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer 

we also sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of the products and services for each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element the allocated arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above selling prices are determined by using vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists otherwise selling prices are determined using third party evidence “tpe” if neither vsoe or tpe is available we use our best estimate of selling prices 

we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a cost of sales 

deferred revenue includes 1 payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services and 2 amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met   

we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales intransit to customers at the end of each period based on a weightedaverage analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes dropshipment arrangements this analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount of  sales intransit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been received by the customer changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period 

vendor programs 

we receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates bid programs price protection and other programs these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory depending on the nature of the incentive vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs which could have an impact on our results of operations 

we record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets if actual performance does not match our estimates we may be required to adjust our receivables we record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors’ 

 50 

inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims however if actual collections differ from our estimates we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross profit and income from operations 

goodwill 

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of goodwill utilizing either a quantitative or qualitative impairment test on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment the annual test for impairment is conducted as of december 1 our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments 

under a quantitative assessment testing for impairment of goodwill is a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach 75 and a market approach 25 as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants 

under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit are based on internally generated forecasts for the remainder of the respective reporting period and the next ten years we use a range of 2035 longterm assumed consolidated annual net sales growth rate for periods after the tenyear forecast 

under the market approach we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for guideline companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company the valuation multiples are applied to the reporting units 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including net sales growth rates gross margins operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others any changes in the judgments estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results 

under a qualitative assessment the most recent quantitative assessment is the starting point to determine if it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value as part of this qualitative assessment we assess relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance changes in share price and entityspecific events 

december 1 2016 impairment analysis 

we completed our annual impairment analysis as of december 1 2016  for the corporate public and canada reporting units we performed a qualitative analysis we determined that it was morelikelythannot that the individual fair values of the corporate public and canada reporting units exceeded the individual carrying values as a result of this determination the quantitative twostep impairment analysis was deemed unnecessary due to the substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the referendum on the united kingdom’s “uk” membership of the european union “eu” advising for the exit of the uk from europe we performed a quantitative analysis of the cdw uk reporting unit based on the results of the quantitative analysis we determined that the fair value of the cdw uk reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 16 and no impairment existed we identified that the most sensitive assumptions used in the quantitative analysis were net sales growth and ebitda margin and although we believe our assumptions are reasonable based on current market conditions actual results may vary significantly and could expose us to impairment charges in the future 

december 1 2015 impairment analysis 

we completed our annual impairment analysis as of december 1 2015 by utilizing a qualitative assessment for all reporting units we determined that it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as a result of this determination the quantitative twostep impairment analysis was deemed unnecessary 

intangible assets 

intangible assets include customer relationships trade names internally developed software and other intangibles intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life these intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows 

 51 

resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value in addition each quarter we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each of these intangible assets if we were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 

during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 we concluded our intangible assets with finite lives were not impaired and no changes to the remaining useful lives were necessary 

income taxes 

deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis this evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

we account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks 

interest rate risk 

our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates the interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility our senior secured term loan facility and the cdw uk term loan are floating and therefore are subject to fluctuations in order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility we have entered into interest rate caps to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2016  we have interest rate cap agreements in effect through january 14 2017 with a combined notional amount of 14000 million which entitle us to payments from the counterparty of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 20 during the agreement period 

in connection with the expiration of the interest rate cap agreements noted above in the first quarter of 2017 during the year ended december 31 2016  we entered into new additional interest rate cap agreements in effect through december 31 2018 with a combined notional amount of 14000 million which entitle us to payments from the counterparty of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 15 during the agreement period for additional details see note 8   longterm debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations” for information on cash flows interest rates and maturity dates of our debt obligations 

foreign currency risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies other than the us dollar primarily the canadian dollar and the british pound which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations revenue and expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currencies of the corresponding countries the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the same as the corresponding local currency upon consolidation as results of operations are translated operating results may differ from expectations the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has not been material as the majority of our results of operations are denominated in us dollars

pursuant to our corporate governance guidelines each nonemployee director must hold equity interests in the company’s common stock equal to at least 500000 until such guideline is met a director is required to retain 100 of the aftertax value of all vested equity awards earned under the company’s nonemployee director compensation program

our executive officers 

see part i  “executive officers” for information about our executive officers which is incorporated by reference in this item 10 

corporate governance 

our success is built on the trust we have earned from our customers coworkers business partners investors and communities and trust sustains our success part of this trust stems from our commitment to good corporate governance to provide a framework for effective governance our board of directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines which outline the operating principles of our board and the composition and working processes of our board and its committees the nominating and corporate governance committee periodically reviews our corporate governance guidelines and developments in corporate governance and recommends proposed changes to the board for approval 

our corporate governance guidelines along with other corporate governance documents such as committee charters and the cdw way code our code of business conduct and ethics are available on our website at wwwcdwcom  by clicking on investor relations and then corporate governance 

independence of our board of directors 

under our corporate governance guidelines and the listing standards of nasdaq a majority of our board members must be independent the board of directors annually determines whether each of our directors is independent in determining independence the board follows the independence criteria set forth in the nasdaq listing standards and considers all relevant facts and circumstances 

under the nasdaq independence criteria a director cannot be considered independent if he or she has one of the relationships specifically enumerated in the nasdaq listing standards in addition the board must affirmatively determine that a director does not have a relationship that in the opinion of the board would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director the board has affirmatively determined that each of our current directors is independent under the applicable listing standards of nasdaq other than our chief executive officer thomas e richards 

board of directors leadership structure 

thomas e richards our chief executive officer serves as the chairman of our board of directors and barry k allen a nonexecutive and independent director serves as the lead director of our board of directors the board believes that the combined role of chairman and chief executive officer together with the appointment of an independent lead director the independence of all board members other than our chief executive officer and the use of regular executive sessions of the independent directors achieves an appropriate balance between the effective development of key strategic and operational objectives and independent oversight of management’s execution of those objectives 

the board believes that having the company’s chief executive officer serve as the chairman is in the best interest of its stockholders at this time because this structure ensures a seamless flow of communication between management and the board in particular with respect to the board’s oversight of the company’s strategic direction as well as the board’s ability to ensure management’s focused execution of that strategy the board additionally believes that because the chief executive officer is the director most familiar with the company’s business industry and daytoday operations he is wellpositioned to help the board focus on those issues of greatest importance to the company and its stockholders and to assist the board with identifying the company’s strategic priorities as well as the shortterm and longterm risks and challenges facing the company while independent directors have invaluable experience and expertise from outside the company and its business giving them different perspectives regarding the development of the company’s strategic goals and objectives the chief executive officer is wellsuited to bring companyspecific experience and industry expertise to his discussions with independent directors 

under our corporate governance guidelines the primary roles of the lead director are to assist the chairman in managing the governance of the board and to serve as a liaison between the chairman and other directors the lead director 1 presides at all meetings of the board at which the chairman is not present including all executive sessions of the nonmanagement andor independent directors 2 has the authority to call meetings of the nonmanagement andor independent directors 3 serves as a contact for interested parties who wish to communicate with nonmanagement directors and 4 provides input to the chairman on the annual board calendar agenda items and schedules for each board meeting and the materials and information to be presented to the board 

 108 

the board does not believe that a single leadership structure is right for all companies at all times however so the board will periodically review its leadership structure to determine based on the circumstances at the time whether it and its committees are functioning effectively 

board and committee meetings 

under our corporate governance guidelines our directors are expected to attend meetings of the board and applicable committees and annual meetings of stockholders 

in 2016 the board held four meetings in 2016 each of the directors attended at least 75 of the aggregate of all meetings of the board and the committees on which he or she served during the periods for which he or she served on the board and such committees in addition thirteen of the directors then in office attended our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders 

board committees 

our board has three committees the audit committee the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee our board has adopted charters for each of these committees which are available on our website at wwwcdwcom   under the committees’ charters the committees report regularly to the board and as the board requests additional information on each of these committees is set forth below

the company’s strong operational performance including its adjusted ebitda nongaap net income per diluted share and free cash flow performance   contributed to payouts under the company’s 2016 annual cash bonus program and 2014 performancebased equity awards please see the “annual cash incentive awards senior management incentive plan” and “longterm incentive programs” sections of this cda for further information regarding these programs including the award opportunities performance measures and payouts under these programs 

our executive compensation program 

our executive compensation program is designed to drive abovemarket results and is built upon our performancedriven culture and longstanding executive compensation philosophies and objectives as described below under “our executive compensation philosophies and objectives” which we believe have been key contributors to our longterm success the table below outlines each of the principal elements of the company’s executive compensation program 

 114 

the chart below illustrates the pay for performance design of our 2016 executive compensation program for 2016 approximately 86 of the target compensation of our chief executive officer was variable and is realized only if the applicable financial performance goals are met andor our stock price increases   

our executive compensation practices 

the compensation committee reviews on an ongoing basis the company’s executive compensation program to evaluate whether it supports the company’s executive compensation philosophies and objectives and is aligned with stockholder interests our executive compensation practices include the following each of which the compensation committee believes reinforces our executive compensation objectives 

 115 

2016 sayonpay vote 

as noted above in its compensation review process the compensation committee considers whether the company’s executive compensation program is aligned with the interests of the company’s stockholders in that respect as part of its review of the company’s executive compensation program the compensation committee considered the approval by approximately 99 of the votes cast for the company’s sayonpay vote at our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders the compensation committee determined that the company’s executive compensation philosophies and objectives and compensation elements continued to be appropriate and did not make any changes to the company’s executive compensation program in response to the 2016 sayonpay vote 

what we pay and why 

2016 executive compensation decisions 

consistent with our payforperformance philosophy and executive compensation program objectives described below under “our executive compensation philosophies and objectives” in determining the 2016 adjustments to executive compensation levels and the mix of compensation elements for each named executive officer the compensation committee and our chief executive officer in making recommendations regarding named executive officer compensation other than his own considered each named executive officer’s prior performance company performance the compensation levels paid to similarly situated executive officers at the company the competitive median of the market data to provide a perspective on external practices and input from the compensation committee’s independent compensation consultant in approving 2016 compensation adjustments the compensation committee considered in particular the compensation levels of the named executive officers as compared to the competitive median of the market data noting that some of the company’s named executive officers were meaningfully positioned below the competitive median despite the company’s above market performance 

as a result of several years of strong results coupled with previously granted equity awards while the company was privately owned our named executive officers have accumulated significant value through their equity ownership in cdw when determining 2016 compensation for each of our named executive officers the compensation committee and our chief executive officer considered this accumulated value in conjunction with the leadership opportunities presented to each executive to motivate 

 116 

him or her in 2016 and beyond    

alignment of executive compensation program with operational performance 

our executive compensation program is designed to drive sustained meaningful profitable growth and shareholder value creation by aligning all members of senior management around common performance goals the compensation committee selects performance goals that it believes are core drivers of the company’s operational performance and shareholder value creation by using performance goals under the company’s incentive programs that are based on ebitda earnings per share and free cash flow as adjusted in accordance with the terms of the awards as well as market share gains the compensation committee believes that the program reflects an appropriate balance with respect to incentivizing profitability topline growth and cash flow generation 

to drive performance against our program goals when communicating the goals to the senior management team the company includes extensive communications on what members of senior management together with their teams can do on a daily basis to impact achievement of these goals we believe this understanding of the link between individualteam performance and the achievement of the company’s financial performance goals helps the entire organization focus on those actions that have the greatest potential to drive sustained meaningful profitable growth and stockholder value creation 

base salary 

the compensation committee generally sets base salaries for executives including our named executive officers below the competitive market median of salaries for executives in similar positions aligned with our compensation philosophies and objectives a significant portion of each named executive officer’s annual target cash compensation is at risk to provide a strong connection between pay and performance accordingly in 2016 mr richards’ annual target cash compensation was weighted 40 base salary and 60 annual incentive target the table below sets forth the 2016 base salary level for each of our named executive officers 



annual cash incentive awards senior management incentive plan 

we provide our senior management with shortterm incentive compensation through our annual cash bonus program the senior management incentive plan “smip” shortterm compensation under smip represents a majority of each named executive officer’s total target cash compensation opportunity in a given year 

setting the target opportunity under smip 

because our named executive officer base salary levels historically have been targeted to be below the competitive market median the compensation committee uses an abovemedian target smip opportunity to bring targeted total cash compensation within the median range 

2016 smip pay for performance alignment 

the compensation committee undertakes a rigorous review and analysis to establish annual performance goals under smip that require abovemarket performance factors considered by the compensation committee in establishing the performance goals include us it market growth rate expectations and our market share gain expectations as well as assumptions regarding our productivity gains and investments 

for 2016 the compensation committee established the following goals and payout levels under smip 



 117 

committee determined to exclude the effect of currency fluctuations from the payout calculations as the compensation committee believed that compensation should not be based on factors outside of the control of the smip participants under this plan design performance goals and results are calculated using exchange rates determined at the time the performance goals were established 

   

the threshold target and maximum payout opportunities under the smip payout curve are set forth below 



2016 smip results and payouts 

our 2016 adjusted ebitda measured on a constant currency basis was 1119 million and the compensation committee determined that we had achieved 1016 of our adjusted ebitda performance goal in addition based upon industry surveys and reports and financial information from other publicly traded companies in our market see footnote 3 above the compensation committee determined that our market share grew the smip payout percentage for the named executive officers therefore was 1157 of their 2016 smip targets the table below sets forth the smip bonus targets and payouts to each of our named executive officers based upon 2016 performance 



longterm incentive program 

under our longterm incentive program the compensation committee has the authority to award various forms of longterm incentive grants including stock options performancebased awards and restricted stock units the compensation committee’s objectives for the 2016 longterm incentive awards were to 

 

for 2016 the annual longterm incentive grant was delivered in the form of performance shares and stock options with the following key elements to drive company performance and align with stockholder interests 

 118 



2016 longterm incentive program pay for performance alignment 

for 2016 100 of the longterm incentive awards granted to the named executive officers consisted of performancebased equity awards stock options have value to an award recipient only if our stock price appreciates while the performance shares have value if and only to the extent that the preestablished quantitative performance metrics relating to adjusted fcf and adjusted eps as described below are achieved during the threeyear performance period the compensation committee selected adjusted fcf and adjusted eps as the metrics for the performance shares because it believes successful performance against these measures promotes the creation of longterm shareholder value in selecting these metrics the company focused on earnings and cash flow as critical measures of operational success but distinguished the performance share metrics from the smip metric adjusted ebitda by including interest taxes depreciation and amortization in the measure of earnings and including interest taxes and working capital in the measure of cash flow the compensation committee intends to provide a stronger linkage to longerterm growth in stockholder value consistent with the smip design the performance goals under the 2016 performance share awards will be determined on a constant currency basis as the compensation committee believed that compensation should not be based on factors outside of the control of program participants under this plan design the performance goals and results will be calculated using exchange rates determined at the time the performance goals were established the committee established the payout curves for the performance shares to encourage strong focused performance given the economic and market conditions at the time the targets were set the target payout levels were designed to be challenging but achievable while payouts at the maximum levels were designed to be stretch goals 

under the performance share agreements adjusted fcf and adjusted eps are generally calculated as follows 

 nongaap net income is defined as net income adjusted for the items set forth in the company’s earnings releases which may include among other items amortization of intangibles noncash equitybased compensation losses or gains on longterm debt extinguishments and acquisition and integration expenses free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities minus capital expenditures plus or minus net change in accounts payableinventory financing each year during the performance period 

 the impact of extraordinary unusual infrequently occurring nonrecurring and unanticipated events will be excluded such as severance expenses attributable to a reduction in force asset impairments reserves for uncertain tax positions and reserves for loss contingencies or payments for settlements or judgments each as determined under gaap and the effect of any change in tax laws accounting principles or other laws or regulations affecting results 

 119 

setting award levels under 2016 longterm incentive program 

in determining the 2016 longterm incentive award levels for named executive officers the compensation committee compared the target total direct compensation of each named executive officer to the competitive market median the table below sets forth the target award value as of the date of grant of the longterm incentive award received by each named executive officer under our 2016 longterm incentive program which was delivered 50 in performance shares and 50 in stock options 



1 amounts reported in this column represent the target equity award granted to each named executive officer in 2016 with the number of shares subject to the performance share and stock option awards determined based on our closing stock price on the date of grant and a conversion ratio of three to one for stock options versus full value awards the target value of the stock option awards differs from the compensation reported in the summary compensation table due to the calculation of the grant date fair value in the summary compensation table based on a blackscholes option pricing model which incorporates various assumptions including volatility expected term riskfree interest rates and expected dividend yield commencing in 2017 the conversion ratio for stock options versus full value awards will be based on this blackscholes option pricing model 

2014 longterm incentive program results and payouts 

under the terms of the performance share units “psus” granted as part of the 2014 longterm incentive program 2016 represented the final year of the threeyear performance period for the 2014 psus the 2014 psus vested based on the attainment of cumulative performance goals relating to adjusted fcf and adjusted eps during the 20142016 performance period with each goal weighted equally in the determination of the vesting level these performance goals were set in 2014 based on the company’s strategic plans at the time based on performance participants were eligible to receive a payout ranging from 0  200 of target with a threshold payout opportunity equal to 50 of target 

the threshold target and maximum payout opportunities under the 2014 psu payout curve are set forth below

other elements of our 2016 executive compensation program 

severance arrangements 

during 2016 the named executive officers were each subject to a compensation protection agreement that provided for severance benefits upon certain qualifying terminations of employment with the company the “compensation protection agreements” the compensation committee believes that these severance benefits 1 help secure the continued employment and dedication of our named executive officers 2 enhance the company’s value to a potential acquirer because our named executive officers have noncompetition nonsolicitation and confidentiality provisions that apply after any termination of employment including after a change in control of the company and 3 are important as a recruitment and retention device as many of the companies with which we compete for executive talent have similar agreements in place for their senior management consistent with market practices the compensation protection agreements do not include change in controlrelated tax grossups and are for three year fixed terms with certain term extensions in the event of a “potential change in control” or “change in control” during the term 

in march 2016 each of the named executive officers entered into an amended and restated compensation protection agreement which preserved the severance benefits contained in the existing agreement but extended the term for an additional three year fixed term commencing january 1 2017 with certain term extensions in the event of a “potential change in control” or “change in control” during the term 

additional information regarding the employment arrangements with each of our named executive officers including a quantification of benefits that would have been received by each named executive officer had his or her employment terminated on december 31 2016 is provided under “2016 potential payments upon termination or change in control” 

rdu plan 

during 2016 our named executive officers participated in the rdu plan a legacy nonqualified deferred compensation plan established by our board of directors in 2010 in order to retain key leaders prior to our initial public offering and focus them on driving the longterm success of the company while participants are able to receive cash payments under the rdu plan with respect to rdu grants made at or prior to our initial public offering no new grants have been made since that time and the plan is closed under the terms of the rdu plan participants will receive cash distributions with respect to their account balances in 2017 which will remain subject to clawback for a 24month period in the event of a termination for “cause” or the named executive officer’s violation of any restrictive covenant agreement with respect to noncompetition nonsolicitation confidentiality or trade secrets 

for additional information regarding the operation of this legacy plan please see the narrative accompanying the “2016 nonqualified deferred compensation” table 

other benefits 

our named executive officers participate in our corporatewide benefit programs our named executive officers are offered benefits that generally are commensurate with the benefits provided to all of our fulltime coworkers which includes participation in our qualified defined contribution plan consistent with our performancebased culture we do not offer a servicebased defined benefit pension plan or other similar benefits to our coworkers similarly we do not provide nonqualified retirement programs or perquisites that are often provided at other companies to executive officers 

 121 

clawback policy 

the compensation committee adopted a clawback policy in the event the company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with a financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws if a current or former executive officer engaged in intentional misconduct that caused or partially caused the need for the restatement the compensation committee may in its discretion and to the full extent permitted by governing law require reimbursement of that portion of any cash bonus paid to or performance sharesunits earned by such executive officer during the threeyear period preceding the date on which the company is required to prepare the restatement which is in excess of what would have been paid or earned by such executive officer had the financial results been properly reported 

stock ownership guidelines 

the compensation committee believes that in order to more closely align the interests of executives with the interests of the company’s other stockholders all executives should maintain a minimum level of equity interests in the company’s common stock the compensation committee has adopted stock ownership guidelines requiring ownership of six times base salary for our chief executive officer and three times base salary for our other executive officers until the guideline is met an executive officer is required to retain 50 of the aftertax shares acquired upon exercise of stock options and vesting of performance sharesunits and restricted sharesunits as of the date of this form 10k all named executive officers had attained the required ownership guideline 

hedging short sales and pledging policies 

our executive officers are prohibited from hedging and short sales transactions with respect to our securities in addition our executive officers are prohibited from pledging our securities except in limited circumstances with preapproval for a further description of these policies please see part iii  item 10  “corporate governance  hedging short sales and pledging policies” 

how we make executive compensation decisions 

our executive compensation philosophies and objectives 

the compensation committee believes that our executive compensation program should reward actions and behaviors that drive sustained meaningful profitable growth and stockholder value creation the compensation committee seeks to foster these objectives through a compensation system that focuses heavily on variable performancebased incentives that create a balanced focus on our shortterm and longterm strategic and financial goals the compensation committee’s goal has been to implement an executive compensation program that would continue to drive abovemarket results and that is built upon our longstanding executive compensation philosophies and objectives as outlined below which we believe have been key contributors to our longterm success 

role of the board compensation committee and our executive officers 

the compensation committee is responsible for determining the annual cash compensation of our chief executive officer and each of our other executive officers in the case of the 2016 longterm incentives the compensation committee was responsible for recommending to the board for approval the targeted grant levels for each of our executive officers based on the recommendations of the compensation committee the board approved the 2016 longterm incentive awards in setting or recommending as applicable the compensation of our chief executive officer the compensation committee takes into account 

 122 

the nominating and corporate governance committee’s review of the chief executive officer’s performance in setting or recommending as applicable the compensation of our other executive officers the compensation committee takes into account the chief executive officer’s review of each executive officer’s performance and his recommendations with respect to their compensation the compensation committee’s responsibilities regarding executive compensation are further described in the “corporate governance” section of this proxy statement 

guidance from independent compensation consultant 

frederic w cook  co inc the “compensation consultant” provides executive compensation consulting services to the compensation committee in 2016 the compensation consultant provided services related to the review of 2016 compensation adjustments including a review of peer group compensation data awards under our longterm incentive program the setting of performance goals in our variable incentive plans including the payout leverage for results above and below the target performance levels our compensation protection agreements a review of trends in executive compensation and our compensation peer group and assistance with this cda the compensation consultant is retained by and reports to the compensation committee and at the request of the compensation committee participates in committee meetings the compensation consultant did not provide any services to the company in 2016 the compensation committee reviewed the independence of the compensation consultant under nasdaq and sec rules and concluded that the work of the compensation consultant has not raised any conflict of interest 

comparison to relevant peer group 

to obtain a broad view of competitive practices among industry peers and competitors for executive talent the compensation committee reviews market data for peer group companies as well as a general industry survey in selecting companies for our peer group the compensation committee considers companies that meet one or more of the following peer group selection criteria established by the compensation committee 

for 2016 compensation decisions the compensation committee utilized the peer group set forth below which was the same peer group used by the compensation committee with respect to 2015 compensation decisions based on data compiled by the compensation consultant at the time of the peer group review our revenues and ebitda were between the median and 75th percentile of our peer group 

the compensation consultant provides competitive data utilizing peer group proxy data and aon hewitt provides revenue sizeadjusted competitive data from its general industry database in reviewing the sizeadjusted data from the aon hewitt general industry database the compensation committee does not review data from the specific companies included in the database for mr richards the peer group was the primary market data source for evaluating 2016 base salary annual cash incentive award opportunity and longterm incentive opportunity given the availability of chief executive officer compensation data in public filings with the compensation survey data providing a supplemental viewpoint for our other named executive officers the compensation committee reviewed both peer group data when available and compensation survey data when evaluating the 2016 base salary annual cash incentive opportunities and longterm incentive opportunities for purposes of this cda the peer group data and compensation survey data are collectively referred to as “market data”

nonqualified deferred compensation 

as noted in the cda in 2010 our board of directors adopted the rdu plan an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan that was designed to retain key leaders and focus them on driving the longterm success of the company participants in the rdu plan received rdus that entitled the participant to a proportionate share of payments under the rdu plan determined by dividing the number of rdus held by the participant by 28500 which was the total number of rdus available under the rdu plan prior to our initial public offering the rdus were designed to track two components of the then outstanding senior subordinated notes a principal component and an interest component the total amount of compensation available under the rdu plan was based on these two components 

 128 

the principal component credited the rdu plan with an amount equal to the 285 million face value of the company’s senior subordinated notes the “debt pool” with each rdu representing 1000 face value of the senior subordinated notes participants vested daily in the principal component during employment on a pro rata basis over the period commencing january 1 2012 or if later the date of hire or the date of a subsequent rdu grant through december 31 2014 in connection with our initial public offering and the partial redemption of the senior subordinated notes and in accordance with the terms of the rdu plan the principal component of the rdus converted to a cashdenominated pool upon the redemption of the related senior subordinated notes with the same vesting schedule as set forth above the redemption of the senior subordinated notes per the terms of the rdu plan also resulted in participants being credited in 2013 and 2014 with an additional amount equal to the prepayment premium that would have been paid on an equivalent amount of senior subordinated notes under the terms of the indenture related to such notes under the terms of the rdu plan payment of the principal component as well as the additional amount related to the prepayment premium will be made to participants in 2017 

the interest component credited the rdu plan with amounts equal to the interest that would have been earned on the debt pool from march 10 2010 or if later the date of hire or the date of a subsequent rdu grant through maturity in 2017 however in connection with our initial public offering the compensation committee determined that the accrual of interest credits on the rdus would cease after the redemption of the related senior subordinated notes in order to increase the retentive value of the plan in 2013 the compensation committee established a cash retention pool determined based on the amount of the interest component credits that would have been allocated under the original terms of the rdu plan this cash retention pool has been paid to participants based on their service prior to 2016 and no longer represents an ongoing element of the company’s executive compensation program

history 

founded in 1984 cdw became a public company in 1993 we were a public company from 1993 until october 2007 see below in 2003 we purchased selected united states assets and the canadian operations of micro warehouse which extended our growth platform into canada in 2006 we acquired berbee information networks corporation a regional provider of technology products solutions and customized engineering services in advanced technologies primarily across cisco ibm and microsoft portfolios this acquisition increased our capabilities in customized engineering services and managed services 

on october 12 2007 cdw corporation an illinois corporation was acquired through a merger transaction by an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with madison dearborn partners llc “madison dearborn” and providence equity partners llc “providence equity” cdw corporation continued as the surviving corporation and same legal entity after the acquisition but became a wholly owned subsidiary of vh holdings inc a delaware corporation 

on december 31 2009 cdw corporation merged into cdwc llc an illinois limited liability company owned by vh holdings inc with cdwc llc as the surviving entity this change had no impact on our operations or management on december 31 2009 cdwc llc was renamed cdw llc “cdw llc” on august 17 2010 vh holdings inc was renamed cdw corporation “parent” a delaware corporation 

prior to july 2 2013 the date of our initial public offering “ipo” parent was owned directly by cdw holdings llc cdw holdings a company controlled by investment funds affiliated with madison dearborn and providence equity certain other coinvestors and certain members of cdw management before the ipo madison dearborn and providence equity owned 460 and 406 of our common stock respectively after the ipo and through subsequent secondary offerings from the fourth quarter of 2013 through 2015 their ownership has significantly decreased as of december 31 2015 madison dearborn and providence equity own 49  and 43  of our common stock respectively 

 on july 2 2013 parent completed the ipo of its common stock in connection with the ipo cdw holdings distributed all of its shares of parent’s common stock to its members in june 2013 in accordance with the members’ respective membership interests and was subsequently dissolved in august 2013 see note 10   stockholders’ equity  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” for additional discussion of the ipo 

on november 10 2014 we completed the acquisition of a 35 noncontrolling equity interest in kelway topco limited “kelway” a ukbased it solutions provider which has global supply chain relationships that enable it to conduct business in more than 80 countries on august 1 2015 we completed the acquisition of kelway by purchasing the remaining 65 of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35 to 100 and provided us control the acquisition enhances our ability to provide it solutions to usbased customers with international locations we included the financial results of kelway in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition for further details regarding the acquisition see note 3   acquisition  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements under item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”

our offerings 

our offerings range from discrete hardware and software products and services to complex integrated solutions including one or more of these elements we believe our customers increasingly view technology purchases as integrated solutions rather than discrete product and service categories we estimate t hat approximately 48 of  our net sales in 2015  in the us came from sales of product categories and services typically associated with solutions our hardware products include notebooksmobile devices including tablets network communications enterprise and data storage video monitors printers desktop computers and servers our software products include application suites security virtualization operating systems network management and software as a service “saas” offerings we also provide a full suite of valueaddedservices which range from basic installation warranty and repair services to custom configuration data center and network implementation services as well as managed services that include infrastructure as a service “iaas” offerings

 our customers 

we provide integrated it solutions to over 250000  small medium and large business government education and healthcare customers throughout north america and the united kingdom as a result of the acquisition of kelway we also have the ability to provide products and services to customers in over 80 countries

we may purchase all or only some of the products our vendor partners offer for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions which may include one or more of the following product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements in late 2015 we expanded our partnership with dell through this partnership we have increased our offering of dell products and services to our customers we also purchase software from major software publishers for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer our agreements with software publishers allow the enduser customer to acquire software or licensed products and services 

in addition to purchasing products directly from our vendor partners we purchase products from wholesale distributors for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer these wholesale distributors provide logistics management and supplychain services for us as well as for our vendor partners 

for our north american operations we purchased approximately 50  of the products we sold as discrete products or as components of a solution directly from our vendor partners and the remaining 50 from wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2015  purchases from our three largest wholesale distributors tech data synnex and ingram micro represented 9  9  and 8  of our total purchases

competition 

the market for technology products and services is highly competitive competition is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs quality and breadth of product and service offerings knowledge and expertise of sales force customer service price product availability speed of delivery and credit availability our competition includes 

 we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for a discussion of the risks associated with competition see item 1a “risk factors” 

marketing 

we market the cdw brand to us canadian and british audiences using a variety of channels that include online broadcast print social and other media this promotion is supported by integrated communication efforts targeting decisionmakers influencers and the general public using a combination of news releases case studies media interviews and speaking opportunities we also market to current and prospective customers through integrated marketing programs including behaviorally targeted email print online media events and sponsorships as well as broadcast media 

as a result of our relationships with our vendor partners a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs these programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are 

 8 

typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time we believe that our national scale and analytical techniques that measure the efficacy of our marketing programs differentiate us from our competitors

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect our business results of operations and cash flows some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some important factors that may cause our actual results of operations and cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 

risks related to our business 

general economic conditions could negatively affect technology spending by our customers and put downward pressure on prices which may have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

weak economic conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions government spending cuts and the impact of new government programs or a tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public sector customers 

our sales to our public sector customers are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels an adverse change in government spending policies including ongoing budget cuts at the federal level budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public sector customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows for example in 2013 as a result of sequestration and related budget uncertainty and the partial shutdown of the us federal government for 16 days we experienced significantly reduced us federal sales in our public segment 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products 

we purchase products for resale from vendor partners which include oems and software publishers and wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2015  we purchased approximately 50  of the products we sold directly from vendor partners and the remaining amount from wholesale distributors for our north american operations we are authorized by vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding including purchase rebates sales volume rebates purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business results 

 9 

of operations or cash flows in addition a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows particularly given our substantial indebtedness 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2015  products we purchased from wholesale distributors tech data and synnex each represented 9  of our total purchases and ingram micro represented 8  of our total north american purchases in addition sales of products manufactured by apple cisco emc hp inc hewlett packard enterprise lenovo and microsoft in the aggregate represented 56  of our 2015  net sales sales of products manufactured by cisco and the companies formerly known as hewlettpackard company represented 16  and 18  respectively of our 2015 consolidated net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other key vendor partners the diminished availability of their products or backlogs for their products leading to manufacturer allocation could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position 

additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows further the sale spinoff or combination of any of our vendor partners andor certain of their business units including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services offerings such as cloudbased solutions including saas iaas and paas and the internet of things “iot” we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services offerings as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers a decrease in the rate of innovation or the lack of acceptance of innovations by customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware software and services offerings for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels in addition our success is dependent on our ability to develop relationships with and sell hardware software and services from new emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace to the extent that a vendor’s offering that is highly in demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels or we are unable to develop relationships with new technology providers or companies that we have not historically represented our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 

  10 

 we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for instance while cloudbased solutions present an opportunity for us cloudbased solutions and technologies that deliver technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell leading to a reduction in our sales andor profitability in addition some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to our customers moreover traditional oems have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers if any of these trends becomes more prevalent it could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems including our business systems such as our sales customer management financial and accounting marketing purchasing warehouse management ecommerce and mobile systems as well as our operational platforms including voice and data networks and power systems the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

 the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats including computer viruses malware phishing social engineering unauthorized access and other malicious attacks both internal and external and human error there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business and results of operations 

breaches of data security could adversely impact our business 

our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers and others in addition we operate data centers for our customers which host their technology infrastructure and may store and transmit both businesscritical data and confidential information in connection with our services business our coworkers also have access to our customers’ confidential data and other information we have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however as newer technologies evolve we could be exposed to increased risk of breaches in security breaches in security could expose us our customers or other individuals to a risk of public disclosure loss or misuse of this information resulting in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

 11 

the failure to comply with our public sector contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things termination fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues from our public sector customers are derived from sales to governmental entities educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services sales to public sector customers are highly regulated noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including the false claims act and the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the united states could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public sector customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with the government and other customers in the public sector in addition contracts in the public sector are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization “gpo” or upon default furthermore our inability to enter into or retain contracts with gpos may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those gpos and compete the effect of any of these possible actions could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we fail to provide highquality services to our customers or if our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our service offerings include field services managed services warranties configuration services partner services and telecom services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers we also offer certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide high quality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers’ businesses this could among other things result in legal claims and proceedings and liability moreover as we expand our services and solutions business we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory and other risks we also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation with our customers our brand and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract develop engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business including our key executive management sales services and technical coworkers 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of thomas e richards our chairman and chief executive officer as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers our future success also will depend on our ability to retain our customerfacing coworkers who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with many of our customers in addition as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers for whom the market is extremely competitive 

our inability to attract develop and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and adversely affect our ability to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions moreover our inability to train our sales services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel such consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

a significant portion of the products we sell are manufactured or purchased by our vendor partners outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events that could also cause disruptions to our supply chain include 

  12 

 we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell are purchased or manufactured or may be purchased or manufactured in the future will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargoes sanctions safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell as well as foreign labor strikes and work stoppages or boycotts could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition our exports are subject to regulations and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business 

we have two warehouse and distribution facilities in the united states and one in the united kingdom if the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence we could utilize another distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate three customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on commercial delivery services 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes inclement weather natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales typically on 30day payment terms we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty or in the case of public sector customers during periods of budget constraints 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request these bulk purchases could increase our exposure to inventory obsolescence 

we could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may continue to pursue transactions including strategic investments acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous business risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses any of which could adversely affect our operations

in addition our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades 

our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including general macroeconomic conditions pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our reported results of operations 

our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements while our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars as a result fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our international subsidiaries particularly the british pound and the canadian dollar could cause fluctuations in our reported results of operations we also have foreign currency exposure to the extent sales and purchases are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency such as sales and purchases in euros which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial employment tort and other litigation 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services in the form of ceaseanddesist letters licensing inquiries lawsuits and other communications and demands in our industry such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased increasingly many of these assertions are brought by nonpracticing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue but we may also be subject to suits from inventors competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue lost profits andor an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities including selling certain products and services 

because of our significant sales to governmental entities we also are subject to audits by federal state international national provincial and local authorities we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts 

current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims that we face including the sec’s investigation of our vendor partner program incentives may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings and investigations audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

 14 

failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas including areas of labor and employment advertising ecommerce tax import and export requirements anticorruption data privacy requirements anticompetition and environmental health and safety compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business and the risk of noncompliance we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no guarantee against coworkers contractors or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures as a public company we also are subject to increasingly complex public disclosure corporate governance and accounting requirements that increase compliance costs and require significant management focus 

we have significant deferred cancellation of debt income 

as a result of a 2009 debt modification we realized 3955 million of cancellation of debt income “codi” we made an election under code section 108i to defer this codi from taxable income pursuant to which we are also required to defer certain original issue discount “oid” deductions as they accrue as of december 31 2013 we had deferred approximately 1145 million of oid deductions starting in 2014 we were required to include the deferred codi and the deferred oid into taxable income ratably over a fiveyear period ending in 2018 because we have more codi than the aggregate of our deferred oid on the relevant remaining debt instruments we will have a future cash tax liability associated with our significant deferred codi we have reflected the associated cash tax liability in our deferred taxes for financial accounting purposes 

all of our deferred codi will be accelerated into current taxable income if prior to 2018 we engage in a socalled “impairment transaction” and the gross value of our assets immediately afterward is less than 110 of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred codi and oid the “110 test” as determined under the applicable treasury regulations an “impairment transaction” is any transaction that impairs our ability to pay the tax on our deferred codi and includes dividends or distributions with respect to our equity and charitable contributions in each case in a manner that is not consistent with our historical practice within the meaning of the applicable treasury regulations 

prior to 2018 our willingness to pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our equity could be adversely affected if at the time we do not meet the 110 test and as a result the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution would accelerate the tax payable with respect to our deferred codi we believe that based on our interpretation of applicable treasury regulations the gross value of our assets exceeds 110 of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred codi and oid as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k however we cannot assure you that this will continue to be true in the future 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have important consequences to our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2015  we had 33 billion  of total longterm debt outstanding as defined by gaap and 4396 million  of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements and the ability to borrow an additional 8431 million  under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility the “revolving loan” and an additional £ 500 million   737 million  under our kelway revolving credit facility “kelway credit facility” our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

  15 

 restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit facilities and to a lesser degree our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs a breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities the lenders 

 the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures 

if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior credit facilities if the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness even if we were able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us 

in addition under our revolving loan we are permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of up to 12500 million however our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition the borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors’ eligible accounts receivable net of accounts reserves up to 30 of such eligible accounts receivable which can consist of federal government accounts receivable plus the lesser of i 75 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors’ eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves and ii the product of 85 multiplied by the net orderly liquidation value percentage multiplied by eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves less reserves other than accounts reserves and inventory reserves the borrowing base in effect as of december 31 2015  was 14231 million  and therefore did not restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving loan as of that date 

 16 

our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is also limited by a minimum liquidity condition which provides that if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of i 1250 million and ii the greater of a 10 of the borrowing base and b 1000 million the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under our revolving loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving loan is at least 10 to 10 moreover our revolving loan provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability reserves which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us we cannot assure you that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or were it to do so that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity 

we will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and if not successful we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control our outstanding longterm debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us and accordingly we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” included elsewhere in this report 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or revise or delay our strategic plan we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements including our senior credit facilities and indentures in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations our senior credit facilities restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due furthermore madison dearborn and providence equity have no obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result 

 despite our indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt including secured debt this could further increase the risks associated with our leverage 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above including our possible inability to service our debt will increase as of december 31 2015  we had 8431 million  available for additional borrowing under our revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations net of 21 million  of issued and undrawn letters of credit and 4396 million  of reserves related to our floorplan subfacility and an additional £ 500 million   737 million  available under our kelway credit facility 

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2015  we had 15865 million  of variable rate debt outstanding 14981 million of which is subject to a 10 libor floor if interest rates increase above 1 per annum our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility we 

 17 

cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate cap agreements in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock which may be caused by a number of factors many of which we cannot control including the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and the following 

 in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies including companies in our industry in the past securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility if we were involved in securities litigation we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business 

future sales or distributions of our common stock or the perception in the public markets that these sales or distributions may occur may depress our stock price 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares as of february 19 2016 there were 167740043  shares of our common stock outstanding the shares of our common stock sold in our initial public offering and in registered secondary offerings are freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except that any shares of our common stock that may be acquired by our directors executive officers and other affiliates as that term is defined in the securities act may be sold only in compliance with certain volume limitations and other restrictions of rule 144 under the securities act 

the remaining shares of our common stock to the extent not previously sold pursuant to an exemption from registration will continue to be “restricted securities” within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 under the securities act 

as of february 19 2016 the holders of approximately 16000000 shares of our common stock including madison dearborn and providence equity will continue to have the right to require us to register the sales of such shares under the securities act under the terms of an agreement between us and the holders as of february 19 2016 madison dearborn beneficially owned approximately 49 of our common stock and providence equity beneficially owned approximately 43 of our common stock madison dearborn and providence equity are permitted to distribute all or a portion of the shares of common stock that they hold in one or more pro rata distributions to their respective limited partners and the recipients of the shares would generally be permitted to sell the shares immediately pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act a distribution of shares by madison dearborn or providence equity and the subsequent sale of shares by the recipients or the perception that such a distribution and subsequent sale of shares might occur could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares  

 18 

in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our thenoutstanding shares of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors these provisions 

 our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15 of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire 

conflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of madison dearborn and providence equity 

paul finnegan and robin selati who are principals of madison dearborn and glenn creamer and michael dominguez who are managing directors of providence equity serve on our board of directors madison dearborn providence equity and the entities respectively controlled by them may hold equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us and companies in which they currently invest may begin competing with us as a result of these relationships when conflicts arise between the interests of madison dearborn or providence equity on the one hand and of other stockholders on the other hand these directors may not be disinterested although our directors and officers have a duty of loyalty to us under delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible so long as 1 the material facts relating to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our board of directors and a majority of our disinterested directors approves the transaction 2 the material facts relating to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our stockholders and a majority of our disinterested stockholders approve the transaction or 3 the transaction is otherwise fair to us our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that any principal officer member manager andor employee of madison dearborn or providence equity or any entity that controls is controlled by or under common control with madison dearborn or providence equity other than us or any company that is controlled by us or an investment fund managed by madison dearborn or providence equity will not be required to offer any transaction opportunity of which they become aware to us and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment unless such opportunity is offered to them solely in their capacities as our directors 

 19 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on or make share repurchases of our common stock if we do not continue to pay dividends you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price 

we expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock of 01075 per share per quarter or 043 per share per annum however any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors any determination to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions any potential indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors our board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will repurchase shares of our common stock if we do not pay dividends in the future realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur see “risks related to our businesswe have significant deferred cancellation of debt income” for a discussion of certain tax considerations that could affect our willingness to pay dividends in the future  

we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 

we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us the deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial intellectual property employment tort and other litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state international national provincial and local authorities and by various partners group purchasing organizations and customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the united states in such cases certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

on october 29 2015 the company received a request for production of documents in connection with an investigation by the sec of the company’s vendor partner program incentives the company has produced documents to the sec and is continuing to cooperate with the sec in this matter 

as of december 31 2015  we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters if any has been incurred however the ultimate resolutions of 

 20 

these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable as such our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters

trends and key factors affecting our financial performance 

we believe the following trends may have an important impact on our financial performance 

 key business metrics 

our management monitors a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin net income nongaap net income net income per common share nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda free cash flow return on invested capital cash and cash equivalents net working capital cash conversion cycle defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios sales per coworker and coworker turnover these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management so that actions can be taken as necessary in order to achieve the standards and objectives 

nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda are nongaap financial measures we believe these measures provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility the “term loan” including the excess cash flow payment provision the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio these covenants and definitions are material components of the term loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the term loan our ability to make certain investments incur additional debt and make restricted payments such as dividends and share repurchases as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments for further details regarding the term loan see longterm debt and financing arrangements within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 8   longterm debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the definitions of nongaap net income and adjusted ebitda and reconciliations to net income see “results of operations”

 total net sales in 2015  increased 9142 million  or 76  to 129887 million  compared to 120745 million  in 2014  reflecting both organic net sales growth and the impact of consolidating five months of kelway net sales customer priorities continued to shift more towards integrated solutions which drove higher growth in solutions sales compared to transactional product sales strong sales performance in solutionsfocused products was driven by netcomm and server and serverrelated products the growth in transactional products was led by notebooksmobile devices partially offset by a decline in desktop computers

computers and pointofcare technology carts as some of our larger customers shifted priorities to reducing costs due to industry consolidation 

net sales in other in 2015  increased 3272 million  or 455  compared 2014  other is comprised of cdw advanced services canada and kelway the increase in net sales was driven by the impact of consolidating five months of kelway net sales as well as growth in cdw advanced services partially offset by a decline in the us dollardenominated net sales of canada the net sales of canada in constant currency continued to grow during 2015  compared to 2014

net service contract revenue including items such as thirdparty services warranties and saas contributed a positive impact of 15 basis points to gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction gross profit margin was positively impacted 15 basis points due to a higher mix of services and improved product margin we also experienced a favorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor partner funding vendor partner funding includes purchase discounts volume rebates and cooperative advertising 

gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix net service contract revenue commission revenue pricing strategies market conditions and other factors

interest expense net 

at december 31 2015  our outstanding longterm debt totaled 32597 million  compared to 31660 million  at december 31 2014  an increase of 937 million primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of kelway net interest expense in 2015  was 1595 million  a decrease of 378 million  compared to 1973 million  in 2014  this decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates for 2015  compared to 2014  as a result of redemptions and refinancing activities completed during 2014 and 2015

 gain on remeasurement of equity investment 

on august 1 2015 we completed the acquisition of kelway by purchasing the remaining 65 of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35 to 100 and provided us control as a result our previously held 35  equity investment was remeasured to fair value resulting in a gain of 981 million  recorded in gain on remeasurement of equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations 

income tax expense 

income tax expense was 2439 million  in 2015  compared to 1428 million  in 2014  the effective income tax rate expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes was 377  and 368  for 2015  and 2014  respectively 

for 2015  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and withholding tax expense on the earnings of our canadian business as a result of no longer asserting permanent reinvestment which was partially offset by a deferred tax benefit as a result of a tax rate reduction in the uk for 2014  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes including current year state income tax credits the higher effective tax rate for 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily attributable to higher state income taxes due to lower state income tax credits and the aforementioned canadian withholding tax expense partially offset by the deferred tax benefit reflecting the tax rate reduction in the uk we are asserting that the unremitted earnings of our uk business are indefinitely reinvested 

nongaap financial measure reconciliations 

we have included reconciliations of nongaap net income ebitda adjusted ebitda organic net sales growth and organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014  below nongaap net income excludes among other things charges related to the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets noncash equitybased compensation acquisition and integration expenses and gains and losses from the extinguishment of longterm debt ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below organic net sales growth is calculated as net sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions recorded within the last twelve months organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis is calculated as organic net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on organic net sales compared to the prior period nongaap net income ebitda adjusted ebitda organic net sales growth and organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures 

we believe that nongaap net income ebitda adjusted ebitda organic net sales growth and organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our term loan including the excess cash flow payment provision the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio these covenants and definitions are material components of the term loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the term loan our ability to make certain investments incur additional debt and make restricted payments such as dividends and share repurchases as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments for further details regarding the term loan see note 8   longterm debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

net sales 

net sales by segment in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 are as follows 



 total net sales in 2014 increased 13059 million or 121 to 120745 million compared to 107686 million in 2013 the increase in total net sales was primarily the result of continued growth in transactional products driven by notebooksmobile devices and desktop computers as customers across all channels refreshed their client devices and k12 customers continued to prepare for digital testing requirements and the addition of more than 140 customerfacing coworkers the majority in pre and postsale technical positions such as technical specialists and service delivery roles growth in solutionsfocused products including netcomm and software also contributed to the increase in net sales during 2014 

 39 

corporate segment net sales in 2014 increased 5154 million or 86 compared to 2013 driven by sales growth in the mediumlarge customer channel within our corporate segment net sales to mediumlarge customers increased 4327 million or 86 year over year primarily due to customers refreshing their client devices and making continued investments in technology infrastructure and a continued focus on seller productivity this increase was led by growth in notebooksmobile devices netcomm products software and desktop computers net sales to small business customers increased 827 million or 91 year over year driven by growth in notebooksmobile devices and desktop computers due to customers refreshing their client devices 

public segment net sales in 2014 increased 7149 million or 172 year over year driven by strong performance across all channels in 2013 and through the second quarter of 2014 public segment results were impacted by the combined and residual negative effects of sequestration the partial shutdown of the federal government in 2013 and federal government budget uncertainty however with the finalization of federal budget allocations in early 2014 we began to see improvement in federal sales in the second quarter of 2014 and saw continued momentum through the third quarter of 2014 in conjunction with the federal fiscal yearend this recovery continued into the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with increased customer confidence that a federal budget for 2015 would be in place net sales to government customers increased 1988 million or 159 the increase in net sales to the federal government was led by increases in sales of notebooksmobile devices and desktop computers the increase in net sales to statelocal government customers was led by growth in sales of notebooksmobile devices netcomm products enterprise storage and software due to a continued focus on public safety solutions net sales to education customers increased 3750 million or 259 year over year led by growth in net sales to k12 customers reflecting increased sales of notebooksmobile devices to support digital testing requirements net sales to healthcare customers increased 1411 million or 96 between periods driven by growth in netcomm products notebookmobile devices and desktop computers 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 1610 million or 91 to 19213 million in 2014 compared to 17603 million in 2013 as a percentage of net sales gross profit decreased 40 basis points to 159 during 2014 down from 163 in 2013 gross profit margin was negatively impacted 30 basis points by unfavorable pricemix changes within product margin as transactional product categories such as notebooksmobile devices and desktops experienced a higher rate of net sales growth than our overall net sales growth accompanied by continuing product margin compression in these product categories additionally we experienced an unfavorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor funding in 2014 although vendor funding dollars increased it represented a lower percentage of net sales in 2014 compared to 2013 vendor funding includes purchase discounts volume rebates and cooperative advertising 

gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix net service contract revenue commission revenue pricing strategies market conditions and other factors 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses decreased 106 million or 09 to 11103 million in 2014 compared to 11209 million in 2013 the overall decrease was largely driven by the absence of 743 million in costs incurred during 2013 related to the completion of our ipo this decrease was partially offset by an increase of 314 million or 143 of certain coworker costs between years which was primarily due to higher compensation consistent with increased coworker count and attainmentbased compensation accruals tied to annual performance total coworker count was 7211 up 244 from 6967 at december 31 2013 in addition sales payroll including sales commissions and other variable compensation costs increased 186 million or 39 between years consistent with higher sales and gross profit further offsetting the decrease in selling and administrative expenses was an increase in longterm compensation expense and equity compensation expense of 72 million during 2014 

as a percentage of net sales selling and administrative expenses decreased 120 basis points to 92 in 2014 down from 104 in 2013 the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was largely driven by a decline of 70 basis points in costs related to the ipo in 2013 sales payroll as a percentage of net sales also decreased 30 basis points during 2014 reflecting the lower cost to serve transactional sales compared to solutionsfocused sales consistent with our variable compensation cost structure

for 2014 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes including current year state income tax credits for 2013 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes including current year state income tax credits and an adjustment to deferred state income taxes due to changes in apportionment factors the higher effective tax rate for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in state tax apportionment factors had on deferred state income taxes in 2013 and a lower rate impact of state income tax credits due to the increase in income before income taxes in 2014

nongaap financial measure reconciliations 

we have included reconciliations of nongaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 below nongaap net income excludes among other things charges related to the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets noncash equitybased compensation and gains and losses from the extinguishment of longterm debt ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below nongaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures 

we believe that nongaap net income ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our term loan including the excess cash flow payment provision the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio these covenants and definitions are material components of the term loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the term loan our ability to make certain investments incur additional debt and make restricted payments such as dividends and share repurchases as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments for further details regarding the term loan see note 8   longterm debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

 seasonality 

while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year sales in our corporate segment which primarily serves private sector business customers are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year additionally sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations we also have 8431 million of availability for borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility and an additional £50 million 737 million under the kelway revolving credit facility our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our operating commitments which primarily include the purchase of inventory payroll and general expenses we also take into consideration our overall capital allocation strategy which includes investment for future growth dividend payments acquisitions and stock repurchases we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available for at least the next year however there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions 

longterm debt activities 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we had debt refinancings in connection with these refinancings we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 243 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 see note 8 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details 

share repurchase program 

during 2015 we repurchased 63 million shares of our common stock for 2413 million under the previously announced 500 million share repurchase program for more information on our share repurchase program see item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” 

 44 

acquisition 

on august 1 2015 we completed the acquisition of kelway by purchasing the remaining 65 of its outstanding common stock which increased our ownership interest from 35 to 100 and provided us control for further details regarding the acquisition see note 3 acquisition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

dividends 

a summary of 2015 dividend activity for our common stock is as follows 



on february 9 2016 we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of 01075 per share the dividend will be paid on march 10 2016 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 25 2016 

the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions any potential indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities are as follows 



 45 

operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities are as follows 



 

  46 

 in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs we monitor our cash conversion cycle defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows 



 the cash conversion cycle remained at 21  days at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the increase in dso was primarily driven by a higher accounts receivable balance at december 31 2015 driven by higher public segment sales where customers generally take longer to pay than customers in our corporate segment slower government payments in certain states due to budget issues and an increase in net sales and related accounts receivable for thirdparty services such as software assurance and warranties these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the statement of operations is recorded on a net basis these services have a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sale in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales in addition to the impact of these services on dpo dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms 

the cash conversion cycle decreased to 21 days at december 31 2014 compared to 23 days at december 31 2013 primarily driven by improvement in dso the decline in dso was primarily driven by improved collections and early payments from certain customers additionally the timing of inventory receipts at the end of 2014 had a favorable impact on dio and an unfavorable impact on dpo 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased 1896 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase was primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of kelway by purchasing the remaining 65 of its outstanding common stock on august 1 2015 additionally capital expenditures increased 351 million  to 901 million  from 550 million  for 2015  and 2014  respectively primarily for our new office location and an increase in spending related to improvements to our information technology systems 

net cash used in investing activities increased 1177 million in 2014 compared to 2013 we paid 868 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to acquire a 35 noncontrolling interest in kelway additionally capital expenditures increased 79 million to 550 million from 471 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased 1145 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase was primarily driven by share repurchases during the year ended december 31 2015 which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of 2413 million for more information on our share repurchase program see item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” the increase was partially offset by the changes in accounts payableinventory financing which resulted in an increase in cash provided for financing activities of 204 million and the net impact of our debt transactions which resulted in cash outflows of 71 million and 1459 million during the years 

 47 

ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in cash provided by accounts payableinventory financing was primarily due to a new vendor added to our previously existing inventory financing agreement for a description of the inventory financing transactions impacting each period see note 6 inventory financing agreements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the debt transactions impacting each period see note 8 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 563 million in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease was primarily driven by several debt refinancing transactions during each period and our july 2013 ipo which generated net proceeds of 4247 million after deducting underwriting discounts expenses and transaction costs the net impact of our debt transactions resulted in cash outflows of 1459 million and 5183 million during 2014 and 2013 respectively as cash was used in each period to reduce our total longterm debt for a description of the debt transactions impacting each period see note 8 longterm debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

longterm debt and financing arrangements 

as of december 31 2015 we had total indebtedness of 33 billion  of which 16 billion  was secured indebtedness at december 31 2015 we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures the amount of cdw’s restricted payment capacity under the senior secured term loan facility was 6797 million at december 31 2015 

for further details regarding our debt and each of the transactions described below see note 8   longterm debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

during the year ended december 31 2015 the following events occurred with respect to our debt structure 

 inventory financing agreements 

we have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions these amounts are classified separately as accounts payableinventory financing on the consolidated balance sheets we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due for further details see note 6   inventory financing agreements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

we have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments operating leases and asset retirement obligations our estimated future payments based on undiscounted amounts under contractual obligations that existed as of december 31 2015 are as follows 



 48 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

inflation 

inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results we generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing we also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements and by accelerating our overall cash conversion cycle there can be no assurances however that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future 

commitments and contingencies 

the information set forth in note 14   commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources these estimates have not historically required significant management judgment our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates nor have we historically made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future however actual results could differ from those estimates 

in note 1   description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers including oems software publishers and wholesale distributors we record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale delivery has occurred andor services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our shipping terms typically specify fob destination at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

 49 

revenues from the sales of hardware products and software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales these items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways including i as physical product shipped from our warehouse ii via dropshipment by the vendor or supplier or iii via electronic delivery for software licenses at the time of sale we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience our vendor partners warrant most of the products we sell 

we leverage dropshipment arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs we recognize revenue for dropshipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify fob destination we recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer we set the price of the product charged to the customer we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced and we work closely with our customers to determine their hardware and software specifications these arrangements generally represent approximately 45 to 55  of total net sales including approximately 15 to 20  related to electronic delivery for software licenses 

revenue from professional services is either recognized as provided for services billed at an hourly rate recognized using a percentage of completion model for fixed fee project work or recognized using a proportional performance model for services provided at a fixed fee revenue from cloud computing solutions including software as a service “saas” and infrastructure as a service “iaas” arrangements as well as data center services such as managed and remote managed services server colocation internet connectivity and data backup and storage is recognized over the period service is provided 

we also sell certain products for which we act as an agent products in this category include the sale of thirdparty services warranties software assurance “sa” and thirdparty hosted saas and iaas arrangements sa is a product that allows customers to upgrade at no additional cost to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the sa is in effect these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale under net sales recognition the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 

our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements “eas” under eas customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year regardless of changes to their employee base customers are charged an annual trueup fee for changes in the number of users over the year with most eas our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount in certain instances we bill the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer 

we also sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of the products and services for each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element the allocated arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above selling prices are determined by using vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists otherwise selling prices are determined using third party evidence “tpe” if neither vsoe or tpe is available we use our best estimate of selling prices 

we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a cost of sales 

deferred  revenue includes 1 payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services and 2 amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met   

we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales intransit to customers at the end of each period based on a weightedaverage analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes dropshipment arrangements this analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount of  sales intransit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been received by the customer changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period 

vendor programs 

we receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates bid programs price protection and other programs these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory depending on the nature of the incentive vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs which could have an impact on our results of operations 

 50 

we record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets if actual performance does not match our estimates we may be required to adjust our receivables we record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors’ inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims however if actual collections differ from our estimates we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 

goodwill 

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of goodwill utilizing either a quantitative or qualitative impairment test on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment the annual test for impairment is conducted as of december 1 our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as its operating segments 

under a quantitative assessment testing for impairment of goodwill is a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach 75 and a market approach 25 as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants 

under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit are based on internally generated forecasts for the remainder of the respective reporting period and the next six years we use a 35 longterm assumed consolidated annual net sales growth rate for periods after the sixyear forecast 

under the market approach we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for guideline companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company the valuation multiples are applied to the reporting units 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including net sales growth rates gross margins operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others any changes in the judgments estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results 

under a qualitative assessment the most recent quantitative assessment is the starting point to determine if it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s goodwill is impaired as part of this qualitative assessment we assess relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance changes in share price and entityspecific events 

december 1 2015 impairment analysis 

we completed our annual impairment analysis as of december 1 2015 by utilizing a qualitative assessment for all reporting units we determined that it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as a result of this determination the quantitative twostep impairment analysis was deemed unnecessary 

 51 

december 1 2014 impairment analysis 

we performed our annual impairment analysis as of december 1 2014 by utilizing a quantitative assessment for all reporting units each reporting unit passed the first step of the analysis and accordingly we were not required to perform the second step of the analysis the estimated fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets information regarding our 2014 impairment analysis is as follows 



intangible assets 

intangible assets include customer relationships trade names internally developed software and other intangibles intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software these intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value in addition each quarter we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each of these intangible assets if we were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 

during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 we concluded our intangible assets with determinable lives were not impaired and no significant changes to the remaining useful lives were necessary 

income taxes 

deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis this evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

we account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks 

interest rate risk 

our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates the interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility our senior secured term loan facility and the kelway term loan are floating and therefore are subject to fluctuations in order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility we have entered into interest rate caps to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2015  we have twenty interest rate cap agreements in effect through january 14 2017 with a combined notional amount of 14000 million which entitle us to payments from the counterparty of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 20 during the agreement period for additional details see note 8   longterm debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations” for information on cash flows interest rates and maturity dates of our debt obligations 

foreign currency risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies other than the us dollar primarily the canadian dollar and the british pound which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations revenue and expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currencies of the corresponding countries the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the same as the corresponding local currency upon consolidation as results of operations are translated operating results may differ from expectations the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has not been material as the majority of our results of operations are denominated in us dollars

history 

cdw was founded in 1984 in 2003 we purchased selected us assets and the canadian operations of micro warehouse which extended our growth platform into canada in 2006 we acquired berbee information networks corporation a regional provider of technology products solutions and customized engineering services in advanced technologies primarily across cisco ibm and microsoft portfolios this acquisition increased our capabilities in customized engineering services and managed services 

on october 12 2007 cdw corporation an illinois corporation was acquired through a merger transaction by an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with madison dearborn partners llc and providence equity partners llc the “acquisition” cdw corporation continued as the surviving corporation and same legal entity after the acquisition but became a wholly owned subsidiary of vh holdings inc a delaware corporation 

on december 31 2009 cdw corporation merged into cdwc llc an illinois limited liability company owned by vh holdings inc with cdwc llc as the surviving entity this change had no impact on our operations or management on december 31 2009 cdwc llc was renamed cdw llc “cdw llc” on august 17 2010 vh holdings inc was renamed cdw corporation “parent” a delaware corporation 

throughout this report the terms “the company” and “cdw” refer to parent and its 100 owned subsidiaries 

prior to july 2 2013 the date of our initial public offering “ipo” parent was owned directly by cdw holdings llc cdw holdings a company controlled by investment funds affiliated with madison dearborn partners llc and providence equity partners llc the sponsors certain other coinvestors and certain members of cdw management before the ipo madison dearborn partners llc and providence equity partners llc owned 460 and 406 of our common stock respectively after the ipo and through subsequent secondary offerings in fourth quarter of 2013 and during 2014 the sponsors ownership has significantly decreased as of december 31 2014 the sponsors own 155  and 137  of our common stock respectively

our market 

we operate in the us and canadian it markets which are large and growing markets according to idc the overall us it market generated approximately 675 billion  in sales in 2014  we believe our addressable market in the us in the indirect sales channel represents more than 215 billion  in annual sales and for the year ended december 31 2014  our us net sales of 115 billion represented approximately 5 of that highly diverse and fragmented market according to idc the overall canadian it market generated more than 50 billion  in sales in 2014  we believe our addressable market in canada in the indirect sales channel represents more than 11 billion  in annual sales and for the year ended december 31 2014 our net sales of 532 million  in canada represented approximately 5 of that market we believe we have the largest market share in our addressable market with our 2014  net sales exceeding the cumulative north american net sales of our four largest publicly traded sales channel competitors based upon publicly available information for those companies new technologies including cloud virtualization and mobility coupled with the resulting increase in demand for data as well as aging infrastructure are increasingly requiring businesses and institutions to seek integrated solutions to their it needs we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future with enduser demand for business efficiency and productivity driving future it spending growth 

our offerings 

our offerings range from discrete hardware and software products and services to complex integrated solutions that include one or more of these elements we believe our customers increasingly view technology purchases as integrated solutions rather than discrete product and service categories and we estimate t hat approximately 47 of  our net sales in 2014  came from sales of product categories and services typically associated with solutions our hardware products include notebooksmobile devices including tablets network communications enterprise and data storage video monitors printers desktop computers and servers our software products include application suites security virtualization operating systems network management and software as a service “saas” offerings we also provide a full suite of valueaddedservices which range from basic installation warranty and repair services to custom configuration data center and network implementation services as well as managed services that include infrastructure as a service “iaas” offerings

while we believe customers increasingly view technology purchases as solutions rather than discrete product and service categories the following table shows our net sales by major category based upon our internal category classifications 



  

 our customers 

we provide integrated it solutions to approximately 250000  small medium and large business government education and healthcare customers throughout the us and canada sales to the us federal government which are diversified across multiple agencies and departments collectively accounted for approximately 7  7  and 10  of total net sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively however there are several independent purchasing decisionmakers across these agencies and departments excluding these sales to the federal government we are not reliant on any one customer as our next five largest customers cumulatively comprised approximately 3  of our net sales in 2014  

inventory management 

we utilize our it systems to manage our inventory in a costefficient manner resulting in a rapidturn inventory model we generally only stock items that have attained a minimum sales volume 

 7 

our distribution process is highly automated once a customer order is received and credit approved orders are automatically routed to one of our distribution centers for picking and shipping as well as configuration and imaging services we operate two distribution centers a 450000 square foot facility in vernon hills illinois and a 513000 square foot facility in north las vegas nevada we ship almost 37 million  units annually on an aggregate basis from our two distribution centers we believe that the location of our distribution centers allows us to efficiently ship products throughout the us and provide timely access to our principal distributors in addition in the event of weatherrelated or other disruptions at one of our distribution centers we are able to shift order processing and fulfillment from one center to the other quickly and efficiently enabling us to continue to ship products in a timely manner we believe that competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of the product categories we offer we continue to improve the productivity of our distribution centers as measured by key performance indicators such as units shipped per hour worked and bin accuracy 

we also have dropshipment arrangements with many of our oems and wholesale distributors which permit us to offer products to our customers without having to take physical delivery at either of our distribution centers these arrangements generally represent approximately 40 to 50  of total net sales including approximately 15 to 20  related to electronic delivery for software licenses 

information technology systems 

we maintain customized it and unified communication systems that enhance our ability to provide prompt efficient and expert service to our customers in addition these systems enable centralized management of key functions including purchasing inventory management billing and collection of accounts receivable sales and distribution our systems provide us with thorough detailed and realtime information regarding key aspects of our business this capability helps us to continuously enhance productivity ship customer orders quickly and efficiently respond appropriately to industry changes and provide high levels of customer service we believe that our websites which provide electronic order processing and advanced tools such as order tracking reporting and asset management make it easy for customers to transact business with us and ultimately strengthen our customer relationships 

product procurement 

we may purchase all or only some of the products that our vendor partners offer for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions which may include one or more of the following product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements we also purchase software from major software publishers for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer our agreements with software publishers allow the enduser customer to acquire software or licensed products and services 

in addition to purchasing products directly from our vendor partners we purchase products from wholesale distributors for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer these wholesale distributors provide logistics management and supplychain services for us as well as for our vendor partners for the year ended december 31 2014  we purchased 54  of the products we sold as discrete products or as components of a solution directly from our vendor partners and the remaining 46 from wholesale distributors purchases from our three largest wholesale distributors tech data synnex and ingram micro each represented 9  of our total purchases sales of products manufactured by apple cisco emc hewlettpackard lenovo and microsoft whether purchased directly from these vendor partners or from a wholesale distributor represented in the aggregate 54  of our net sales in 2014  sales of products manufactured by hewlettpackard and cisco represented 18  and 14  of our 2014  net sales respectively 

competition 

the market for technology products and services is highly competitive competition is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs quality and breadth of product and service offerings knowledge and expertise of sales force customer service price product availability speed of delivery and credit availability our competition includes 

  8 

 we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for a discussion of the risks associated with competition see “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report 

marketing 

we market the cdw brand to both national and local audiences using a variety of channels that include online broadcast print social and other media this promotion is supported by integrated communication efforts that target decisionmakers influencers and the general public using a combination of news releases case studies media interviews and speaking opportunities we also market to current and prospective customers through integrated marketing programs that include behaviorally targeted email print online media events and sponsorships as well as broadcast media 

as a result of our relationships with our vendor partners a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising reimbursement programs these programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or purchasing volumes or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time we believe that our national scale and analytical techniques that measure the efficacy of our marketing programs differentiate us from our competitors 

coworkers 

as of december 31 2014  we employed 7211  coworkers none of whom is covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our coworker relations to be good 

intellectual property 

the cdw trademark and certain variations thereon are registered or subject to pending trademark applications in the us canada and certain other jurisdictions we believe our trademarks have significant value and are important factors in our marketing programs in addition we own registrations for domain names including cdwcom and cdwgcom for certain of our primary trademarks we also have unregistered copyrights in our website content 




 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect our business results of operations and cash flows some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some important factors that may cause our actual results of operations and cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 

risks related to our business 

general economic conditions could negatively affect technology spending by our customers and put downward pressure on prices which may have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

weak economic conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions us federal government spending cuts and the impact of new government programs or a tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public segment customers 

our sales to our public segment customers are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels although our sales to the federal government are diversified across multiple agencies and departments they collectively accounted for approximately 7  of 2014 net sales an adverse change in government spending policies including ongoing budget cuts at the federal level budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows for example in 2013 as a result of sequestration and related budget uncertainty and the partial shutdown of the federal government for 16 days we experienced significantly reduced federal sales in our public segment 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products 

 9 

we purchase products for resale from vendor partners which include oems and software publishers and wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2014  we purchased approximately 54  of the products we sold directly from vendor partners and the remaining amount from wholesale distributors we are authorized by vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding including purchase rebates sales volume rebates purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows in addition a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows particularly given our substantial indebtedness 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2014  products we purchased from distributors tech data synnex and ingram micro each represented 9  of our total purchases in addition sales of apple cisco emc hewlettpackard lenovo and microsoft products comprise a substantial portion of our sales representing approximately 54  of net sales in 2014  sales of products manufactured by hewlettpackard and cisco represented approximately 18  and 14  respectively of our 2014 net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other key vendor partners the diminished availability of their products or backlogs for their products leading to manufacturer allocation could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position 

additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows further the sale spinoff or combination of any of our vendor partners andor certain of their business units including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services offerings such as cloudbased solutions including saas iaas and paas we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services offerings as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers a decrease in the rate of innovation or the lack of acceptance of innovations by customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware software and services offerings for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels in addition our success is dependent on our ability to develop relationships with and sell hardware software and services from new emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace to the extent that a vendors offering that is highly in demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels or we are unable to develop relationships with new technology providers or companies that we have not historically represented our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 

 10 

   

we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for instance while cloudbased solutions present an opportunity for us cloudbased solutions and technologies that deliver technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell leading to a reduction in our sales andor profitability in addition some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to our customers moreover traditional oems have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers if any of these trends becomes more prevalent it could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems including our business systems such as our sales customer management financial and accounting marketing purchasing warehouse management ecommerce and mobile systems as well as our operational platforms including voice and data networks and power systems the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

   

the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats including computer viruses malware phishing social engineering unauthorized access and other malicious attacks both internal and external and human error there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business and results of operations 

breaches of data security could adversely impact our business 

 11 

our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers and others in addition we operate data centers for our customers which host their technology infrastructure and may store and transmit both businesscritical data and confidential information in connection with our services business our coworkers also have access to our customers confidential data and other information we have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however as newer technologies evolve we could be exposed to increased risk of breaches in security breaches in security could expose us our customers or other individuals to a risk of public disclosure loss or misuse of this information resulting in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the failure to comply with our public segment contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things termination fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues in our public segment are derived from sales to governmental entities educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services sales to public segment customers are highly regulated noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including but not limited to the false claims act and the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public segment customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with the government and other customers in the public segment in addition contracts in the public segment are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization “gpo” or upon default furthermore our inability to enter into or retain contracts with gpos may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those gpos and compete the effect of any of these possible actions could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we fail to provide highquality services to our customers or if our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our service offerings include field services managed services warranties configuration services partner services and telecom services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers we also offer certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide high quality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers businesses this could among other things result in legal claims and proceedings and liability moreover as we expand our services and solutions business we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory and other risks we also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation with our customers our brand and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract develop engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business including our key executive management sales services and technical coworkers 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of thomas e richards our chairman and chief executive officer as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers our future success also will depend on our ability to retain our customerfacing coworkers who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with many of our customers in addition as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers for whom the market is extremely competitive 

our inability to attract develop and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and adversely affect our ability to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions moreover our inability to train our sales services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology 

 12 

needs of our customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel such consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

a significant portion of the products we sell are manufactured or purchased by our vendor partners outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events that could also cause disruptions to our supply chain include 

   

we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell are purchased or manufactured or may be purchased or manufactured in the future will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargoes sanctions safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell as well as foreign labor strikes and work stoppages or boycotts could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition our exports are subject to regulations and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business 

substantially all of our corporate warehouse and distribution functions are located at our vernon hills illinois facilities and our second distribution center in north las vegas nevada if the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence we could utilize the other distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate three customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on commercial delivery services 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes inclement weather natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales typically on 30day payment terms we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty or in the case of public segment customers during periods of budget constraints 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that 

 13 

created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request these bulk purchases could increase our exposure to inventory obsolescence 

we could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may continue to pursue transactions including strategic investments acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous business risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses any of which could adversely affect our operations 

in addition our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades 

our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including general macroeconomic conditions pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial employment tort and other litigation 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services in the form of ceaseanddesist letters licensing inquiries lawsuits and other communications and demands in our industry such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased increasingly many of these assertions are brought by nonpracticing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue but we may also be subject to suits from inventors competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue lost profits andor an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities including selling certain products and services 

because of our significant sales to governmental entities we also are subject to audits by federal state and local authorities we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts 

current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any litigation 

 14 

infringement claim governmental proceeding audit or indemnification claim could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

our operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas including but not limited to areas of labor and employment advertising ecommerce tax import and export requirements anticorruption data privacy requirements anticompetition and environmental health and safety compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business and the risk of noncompliance we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no guarantee against coworkers contractors or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures 

we have significant deferred cancellation of debt income 

as a result of a 2009 debt modification we realized 3955 million of cancellation of debt income “codi” we made an election under code section 108i to defer this codi from taxable income pursuant to which we are also required to defer certain original issue discount “oid” deductions as they accrue as of december 31 2013 we had deferred approximately 1145 million of oid deductions starting in 2014 we were required to include the deferred codi and the deferred oid into taxable income ratably over a fiveyear period ending in 2018 because we have more codi than the aggregate of our deferred oid on the relevant remaining debt instruments we will have a future cash tax liability associated with our significant deferred codi we have reflected the associated cash tax liability in our deferred taxes for financial accounting purposes 

all of our deferred codi will be accelerated into current taxable income if prior to 2018 we engage in a socalled “impairment transaction” and the gross value of our assets immediately afterward is less than 110 of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred codi and oid the “110 test” as determined under the applicable treasury regulations an “impairment transaction” is any transaction that impairs our ability to pay the tax on our deferred codi and includes dividends or distributions with respect to our equity and charitable contributions in each case in a manner that is not consistent with our historical practice within the meaning of the applicable treasury regulations 

prior to 2018 our willingness to pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our equity could be adversely affected if at the time we do not meet the 110 test and as a result the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution would accelerate the tax payable with respect to our deferred codi we believe that based on our interpretation of applicable treasury regulations the gross value of our assets exceeds 110 of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred codi and oid as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k however we cannot assure you that this will continue to be true in the future 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have important consequences to our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2014  we had 32 billion  of total longterm debt outstanding as defined by gaap and 3321 million  of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements and the ability to borrow an additional 9356 million  under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility the “revolving loan” our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

  15 

 restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and to varying degrees our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit facilities and to varying degrees our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs a breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities the lenders 

 the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures 

if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior credit facilities if the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness even if we were able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us 

in addition under our revolving loan we are permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of up to 12500 million however our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition the borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors’ eligible accounts receivable net of accounts reserves up to 30 of such eligible accounts receivable which can consist of federal government accounts receivable plus the lesser of i 75 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors’ eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves and ii the product of 85 multiplied by the net orderly liquidation value percentage multiplied by eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves less reserves other than accounts reserves and inventory 

 16 

reserves the borrowing base in effect as of december 31 2014  was 12534 million  and therefore did not restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving loan as of that date 

our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is also limited by a minimum liquidity condition which provides that if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of i 1250 million and ii the greater of a 10 of the borrowing base and b 1000 million the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under our revolving loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving loan is at least 10 to 10 moreover our revolving loan provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability reserves which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us we cannot assure you that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or were it to do so that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity 

we will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and if not successful we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control our outstanding longterm debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us and accordingly we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” included elsewhere in this report 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or revise or delay our strategic plan we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements including our senior credit facilities and indentures in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our 85 senior notes due 2019 2019 senior notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due furthermore the sponsors have no obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result 

 despite our indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt including secured debt this could further increase the risks associated with our leverage 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above including our possible inability to service our debt will increase as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 9356 million  available for additional borrowing under our revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations net of 21 million  of issued and undrawn letters of credit and 3321 million  of reserves related to our floorplan subfacility 

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2014  we had 15135 million  of variable rate debt outstanding if interest rates increase above 1 per annum our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap 

 17 

agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate cap agreements in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock which may be caused by a number of factors many of which we cannot control including the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and the following 

 in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies including companies in our industry in the past securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility if we were involved in securities litigation we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business 

the sponsors have influence over significant corporate activities and their interests may not align with yours 

madison dearborn beneficially owns approximately 155  of our common stock and providence equity beneficially owns approximately 137  of our common stock as of february 20 2015 as a result of their ownership each sponsor so long as it holds a sizable portion of our outstanding common stock will have substantial voting power with respect to matters submitted to a vote of stockholders in addition so long as each sponsor has representation on our board of directors it will have the ability to exercise influence over decisionmaking with respect to our business direction and policies matters over which each of the sponsors may directly or indirectly exercise influence include 

 

under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation each sponsor and its affiliates do not have any obligation to present to us and each sponsor may separately pursue corporate opportunities of which it becomes aware even if those opportunities are ones that we would have pursued if granted the opportunity 

 18 

future sales of our common stock or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur may depress our stock price 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares as of february 20 2015 there were 172275656  shares of our common stock outstanding the shares of our common stock sold in our initial public offering and in registered secondary offerings are freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except that any shares of our common stock that may be acquired by our directors executive officers and other affiliates as that term is defined in the securities act may be sold only in compliance with certain volume limitations and other restrictions of rule 144 under the securities act 

the remaining shares of our common stock to the extent not previously sold pursuant to an exemption from registration will continue to be “restricted securities” within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 under the securities act 

as of february 20 2015 the holders of approximately 53000000 shares of our common stock will continue to have the right to require us to register the sales of such shares under the securities act under the terms of an agreement between us and the holders 

in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our thenoutstanding shares of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors these provisions 

 our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15 of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire 

 19 

conflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of our largest stockholders 

paul finnegan and robin selati who are principals of madison dearborn and glenn creamer and michael dominguez who are managing directors of providence equity serve on our board of directors as of february 20 2015 madison dearborn and providence equity each continue to hold a sizable portion of our outstanding common stock the sponsors and the entities respectively controlled by them may hold equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us and companies in which they currently invest may begin competing with us as a result of these relationships when conflicts arise between the interests of madison dearborn or providence equity on the one hand and of other stockholders on the other hand these directors may not be disinterested although our directors and officers have a duty of loyalty to us under delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible so long as 1 the material facts relating to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our board of directors and a majority of our disinterested directors approves the transaction 2 the material facts relating to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our stockholders and a majority of our disinterested stockholders approve the transaction or 3 the transaction is otherwise fair to us our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that any principal officer member manager andor employee of a sponsor or any entity that controls is controlled by or under common control with a sponsor other than us or any company that is controlled by us or a sponsormanaged investment fund will not be required to offer any transaction opportunity of which they become aware to us and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment unless such opportunity is offered to them solely in their capacities as our directors 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on or make share repurchases of our common stock if we do not continue to pay dividends you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price 

we expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock of 00675 per share per quarter or 027 per share per annum any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors any determination to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions including those under our senior credit facilities and indentures any potential indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors our board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will repurchase shares of our common stock if we do not pay dividends in the future realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur see “risks related to our businesswe have significant deferred cancellation of debt income” for a discussion of certain tax considerations that could affect our willingness to pay dividends in the future  

we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 

we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us the deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2014  we owned or leased a total of 23 million  square feet of space throughout the us and canada we own two properties a combined office and a 450000 square foot distribution center in vernon hills illinois and a 513000 square foot distribution center in north las vegas nevada in addition we conduct sales services and administrative activities in various leased locations throughout the us and canada including data centers in madison wisconsin and minneapolis minnesota 

 20

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial intellectual property employment tort and other litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state and local authorities and by various partners group purchasing organizations and customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws in such cases certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

as of december 31 2014  we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters if any has been incurred however the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable as such our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters

agencies and departments they collectively accounted for approximately 7  7  and 10  of our net sales for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively in 2013 and through the second quarter of 2014 public segment results were impacted by the combined and residual negative effects of sequestration the partial shutdown of the federal government in 2013 and federal government budget uncertainty however with the finalization of federal budget allocations in early 2014 we began to see improvement in federal sales in the second quarter of 2014 the momentum continued through the third quarter of 2014 in conjunction with the federal fiscal yearend this recovery continued into the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with increased customer confidence that a federal budget for 2015 would be in place 

 key business metrics 

our management monitors a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin net income nongaap net income net income per diluted share nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda return on invested capital cash and cash equivalents cash flow net working capital cash conversion cycle defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios sales per coworker and coworker turnover these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management so that actions can be taken as necessary in order to achieve the standards and objectives nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share and adjusted ebitda are nongaap financial measures we believe these measures provide helpful information with respect to the company’s operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures dividend payments and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our senior credit facilities see selected financial data included elsewhere in this report for the definitions of nongaap net income and adjusted ebitda and reconciliations to net income

total net sales in 2014  increased 13059 million  or 121  to 120745 million  compared to 107686 million  in 2013  there were 254  selling days for both the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013  the increase in total net sales was primarily the result of continued growth in transactional products driven by notebooksmobile devices and desktop computers as customers across all channels refreshed their client devices and k12 customers continued to prepare for digital testing requirements and the addition of more than 140 customerfacing coworkers the majority in pre and postsale technical positions such as technical specialists and service delivery roles growth in solutionsfocused products including netcomm and software also contributed to the increase in net sales during 2014  

corporate segment net sales in 2014  increased 5154 million  or 86  compared to 2013  driven by sales growth in the mediumlarge customer channel within our corporate segment net sales to mediumlarge customers increased 4327 million  or 86  between years primarily due to customers refreshing their client devices and making continued investments in technology infrastructure and a continued focus on seller productivity this increase was led by growth in notebooksmobile devices netcomm products software and desktop computers net sales to small business customers increased 827 million  or 91  between years driven by growth in notebooksmobile devices and desktop computers due to customers refreshing their client devices 

public segment net sales in 2014  increased 7149 million  or 172  between years driven by strong performance across all channels in 2013 and through the second quarter of 2014 public segment results were impacted by the combined and residual negative effects of sequestration the partial shutdown of the federal government in 2013 and federal government budget uncertainty however with the finalization of federal budget allocations in early 2014 we began to see improvement in federal sales in the second quarter of 2014 and saw continued momentum through the third quarter of 2014 in conjunction with 

 36 

the federal fiscal yearend this recovery continued into the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with increased customer confidence that a federal budget for 2015 would be in place net sales to government customers increased 1988 million  or 159  the increase in net sales to the federal government was led by increases in sales of notebooksmobile devices and desktop computers the increase in net sales to statelocal government customers was led by growth in sales of notebooksmobile devices netcomm products enterprise storage and software due to a continued focus on public safety solutions net sales to education customers increased 3750 million  or 259  between years led by growth in net sales to k12 customers reflecting increased sales of notebooksmobile devices to support digital testing requirements net sales to healthcare customers increased 1411 million  or 96  between periods driven by growth in netcomm products notebookmobile devices and desktop computers 

gross profit

the gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix net service contract revenue commission revenue pricing strategies market conditions and other factors any of which could result in changes in gross profit margins 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses decreased   106 million  or 09  to 11103 million  in 2014  compared to 11209 million  in 2013  the overall decrease was largely driven by the absence of 743 million in costs incurred during 2013 related to the completion of our ipo this decrease was partially offset by an increase of 314 million or 143 of certain coworker costs between years which was primarily due to higher compensation consistent with increased coworker count and attainmentbased compensation accruals tied to annual performance total coworker count was 7211 up 244 from 6967 at december 31 2013  in addition sales payroll including sales commissions and other variable compensation costs increased 186 million or 39 between years consistent with higher sales and gross profit further offsetting the decrease in selling and administrative expenses was an increase in longterm compensation expense and equity compensation expense of 72 million during 2014 

as a percentage of total net sales selling and administrative expenses decreased   120  basis points to 92  in 2014  down  from 104  in 2013  the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was largely driven by a decline of 70 basis points in costs related to the ipo in 2013  sales payroll as a percentage of net sales also decreased 30 basis points during 2014 reflecting the lower cost to serve transactional sales compared to solutionsfocused sales consistent with our variable compensation cost structure

interest expense net 

at december 31 2013  our outstanding longterm debt totaled 32512 million compared to 37710 million at december 31 2012 we reduced longterm debt throughout the year primarily through the use of a portion of the net proceeds from the ipo and cash flows provided by operating activities net interest expense in 2013 was 2501 million  a decrease of 573 million  compared to 3074 million  in 2012 this decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances and effective interest rates for 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of debt repayments and refinancing activities completed during 2012 and 2013 

net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt 

during 2013  we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt of 640 million  compared to 172 million  in 2012  

in october 2013 we redeemed 1550 million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes in connection with this redemption we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 85 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in august 2013 we redeemed 3240 million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes in connection with this redemption we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 246 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in july 2013 we redeemed 1750 million aggregate principal amount of the senior secured notes in connection with this redemption we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 167 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in april 2013 we entered into a new sevenyear 13500 million aggregate principal amount term loan substantially all of the proceeds were used to repay the 12995 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the prior senior secured term loan facility in connection with this refinancing we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 103 million representing a writeoff of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs related to the prior senior secured term loan facility 

in march 2013 we redeemed 500 million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 39 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in december 2012 we redeemed 1000 million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 78 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

 46 

in february and march 2012 we purchased or redeemed the remaining 1290 million of 110 senior exchange notes due 2015 and 1151225 senior pik election exchange notes due 2015 together the senior notes due 2015 funded with the issuance of an additional 1300 million of senior notes due 2019 as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 94 million representing the difference between the purchase or redemption price of the senior notes due 2015 and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs 

income tax expense 

income tax expense was 627 million  in 2013  compared to 671 million  in 2012  the effective income tax rate was 321  and 360  for 2013  and 2012  respectively 

for 2013  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes including current year state income tax credits and an adjustment to deferred state income taxes due to changes in apportionment factors for 2012  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable adjustments to state tax credits which were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of adjustments to deferred state income taxes due to changes in state tax laws and nondeductible expenses primarily equitybased compensation and meals and entertainment the lower effective tax rate for 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily driven by the favorable impact of adjustments to deferred state income taxes due to changes in state tax apportionment factors and lower nondeductible expenses 

net income 

net income was 1328 million  in 2013 compared to 1190 million  in 2012 significant factors and events causing the net changes between the periods are discussed above 

nongaap net income 

nongaap net income was 3143 million  for the year ended december 31 2013 an increase of 672 million  or 272  compared to 2471 million  for the year ended december 31 2012 

we have included a reconciliation of nongaap net income for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 below nongaap net income excludes among other things charges related to the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles noncash equitybased compensation ipo and secondaryoffering related expenses and gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt nongaap net income is considered a nongaap financial measure generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures we believe that nongaap net income provides helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements 

 47 



 

 adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 8085 million  in 2013 an increase of 419 million or 55 compared to 7666 million  in 2012 as a percentage of net sales adjusted ebitda was 75 and 76 in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2013 and 2012 in the table below ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements 

 48 

  

 the following table sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012   



seasonality 

while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year sales in our corporate segment which primarily serves private sector business customers are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year additionally sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers 

liquidity and capital resources 

 49 

overview 

we finance our operations and capital expenditures through a combination of internally generated cash from operations and from borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility we believe that our current sources of funds will be sufficient to fund our cash operating requirements for the next year in addition we believe that in spite of the uncertainty of future macroeconomic conditions we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available to meet our longerterm needs however there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions 

longterm debt activities 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we had significant debt refinancings in connection with these refinancings we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 907 million  in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2014 see note 7 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional details 

share repurchase program   

on november 6 2014 we announced that our board of directors approved a 500 million share repurchase program effective immediately under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on share price market conditions and other factors the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares and repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice as of the date of this filing no shares have been repurchased under the share repurchase program 

dividends 

a summary of 2014 dividend activity for our common stock is shown below 



on february 10 2015 we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of 00675 per share the dividend will be paid on march 10 2015 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 25 2015 

the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions any potential indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us in each case under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness 

cash flows 

 50 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities were as follows 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2014  increased 687 million  compared to 2013  net income adjusted for the impact of noncash items such as depreciation and amortization equitybased compensation expense and net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt was 4768 million  during 2014  compared to 4134 million  during 2013  the increase in cash of 634 million  reflected stronger operating results in 2014  compared to 2013  net changes in assets and liabilities reduced cash by 418 million  in 2014  compared to a reduction of 471 million  in 2013  resulting in a change of 53 million  between periods the decrease in inventory balances year over year contributed to a 1117 million increase in cash flows which was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and earlier than expected inventory shipments at the end of 2014 due to accelerated customer rollouts partially offsetting the increase in cash flows from inventory was a decline in cash inflows from accounts payable of 1024 million driven by the timing of inventory receipts at the end of 2014 versus 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 increased 489 million compared to 2012 net income adjusted for the impact of noncash items such as depreciation and amortization equitybased compensation expense and net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt was 4134 million during 2013 compared to 3268 million during 2012 an increase of 866 million the increase in cash of 866 million reflected stronger operating results in 2013 compared to 2012 net changes in assets and liabilities reduced cash by 471 million in 2013 compared to a reduction of 94 million in 2012 resulting in a change of 377 million between periods while changes in assets and liabilities were relatively flat during 2012 during 2013 accounts receivable and accounts payable balances decreased and increased cash by 1708 million and 1461 million respectively primarily as a result of accelerated sales growth during the final month of 2013 merchandise inventory also increased during 2013 to support strong sales order volume near the end of 2013 

 51 

in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs we monitor our cash conversion cycle defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average the following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle 



 the cash conversion cycle decreased to 21  days at december 31 2014 compared to 23  days at december 31 2013 primarily driven by improvement in dso the decline in dso was primarily driven by improved collections and early payments from certain customers additionally the timing of inventory receipts at the end of 2014 had a favorable impact on dio and an unfavorable impact on dpo 

the cash conversion cycle decreased to 23 days at december 31 2013 compared to 24 days at december 31 2012 the increase in dso was primarily driven by an increase in receivables for thirdparty services such as software assurance and warranties these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the statement of operations is recorded on a net basis the dpo increase was primarily due to an increase in payables for thirdparty services which offsets the related increase in dso discussed above these services have a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sales in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales the timing of quarterend payments also had a favorable impact on dpo at december 31 2013 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased 1177 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  we paid 868 million  in the fourth quarter of 2014  to acquire a 35 noncontrolling interest in kelway additionally capital expenditures increased 79 million  to 550 million  from 471 million  for 2014  and 2013  respectively primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years 

net cash used in investing activities increased 54 million in 2013 compared to 2012 capital expenditures were 471 million and 414 million for 2013 and 2012 respectively primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 563 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  the decrease was primarily driven by several debt refinancing transactions during each period and our july 2013 ipo which generated net proceeds of 4247 million  after deducting underwriting discounts expenses and transaction costs the net impact of our debt transactions resulted in cash outflows of 1613 million  and 5694 million  during 2014  and 2013  respectively as cash was used in each period to reduce our total longterm debt see note 7 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a description of the debt transactions impacting each period 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 1697 million in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease was primarily driven by various debt transactions during each period and our july 2013 ipo which generated net proceeds of 4247 million after deducting underwriting discounts expenses and transaction costs the net impact of our debt transactions resulted 

 52 

in cash outflows of 5694 million and 3106 million during 2013 and 2012 respectively as cash was used in each period to reduce our total longterm debt 

longterm debt and financing arrangements 

as of december 31 2014 we had total indebtedness of  32 billion  of which 15 billion  was secured indebtedness 

at december 31 2014 we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures under the indenture governing the 85 senior notes due 2019 which contains the most restrictive restricted payment provisions in our various credit agreements and indentures we are generally restricted from paying dividends and making other restricted payments for the purpose of determining restricted payment capacity consolidated net income or loss includes certain adjustments that are defined in the applicable indenture at december 31 2014 the amount of cumulative consolidated net income free of restrictions under our credit agreements and indentures was 2303 million  

see note 7 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details regarding our debt and each of the transactions described below 

during the year ended december 31 2014 the following events occurred with respect to our debt structure 

 inventory financing agreements 

we have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions these amounts are classified separately as accounts payableinventory financing on the consolidated balance sheets we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due see note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details 

contractual obligations 

we have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments operating leases and asset retirement obligations the following table presents our estimated future payments under contractual obligations that existed as of december 31 2014 based on undiscounted amounts 

 53 



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

inflation 

inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results we generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing we also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements and by accelerating our overall cash conversion cycle there can be no assurances however that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future 

commitments and contingencies 

the information set forth in note 14 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

in note 1 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

 54 

revenue recognition 

we are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers including oems software publishers and wholesale distributors we record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale delivery has occurred andor services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our shipping terms typically specify fob destination at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

revenues from the sales of hardware products and software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales these items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways including i as physical product shipped from our warehouse ii via dropshipment by the vendor or supplier or iii via electronic delivery for software licenses at the time of sale we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience our vendor partners warrant most of the products we sell 

we leverage dropshipment arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs we recognize revenue for dropshipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify fob destination we recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer we set the price of the product charged to the customer we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced and we work closely with our customers to determine their hardware and software specifications these arrangements generally represent approximately 40 to 50  of total net sales including approximately 15 to 20  related to electronic delivery for software licenses 

revenue from professional services is either recognized as provided for services billed at an hourly rate or recognized using a proportional performance model for services provided at a fixed fee revenue from cloud computing solutions including software as a service saas and infrastructure as a service iaas arrangements as well as data center services such as managed and remote managed services server colocation internet connectivity and data backup and storage is recognized over the period service is provided 

we also sell certain products for which we act as an agent products in this category include the sale of thirdparty services warranties software assurance “sa” and thirdparty hosted saas and iaas arrangements sa is a product that allows customers to upgrade at no additional cost to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the sa is in effect these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale under net sales recognition the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 

our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements “eas” under eas customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year regardless of changes to their employee base customers are charged an annual trueup fee for changes in the number of users over the year with most eas our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount in certain instances we bill the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer 

from time to time we sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of the products and services for each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element the allocated arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above selling prices are determined by using vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists otherwise selling prices are determined using third party evidence “tpe” if neither vsoe or tpe is available we use our best estimate of selling prices 

we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a cost of sales 

deferred revenue includes 1 payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services and 2 amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met   

we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales intransit to customers at the end of each period based on a weightedaverage analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes dropshipment arrangements this analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount of sales intransit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs 

 55 

to reflect only what has been received by the customer changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period 

inventory valuation 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value cost is determined using a weightedaverage cost method price protection is recorded when earned as a reduction to the cost of inventory we decrease the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand specifically known inventoryrelated risks and assumptions about future demand and market conditions if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

vendor programs 

we receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates bid programs price protection and other programs these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory depending on the nature of the incentive vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs which could have an impact on our results of operations 

we record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets if actual performance does not match our estimates we may be required to adjust our receivables we record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors’ inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims however if actual collections differ from our estimates we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments we are required to perform an evaluation of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment the annual test for impairment is conducted as of december 1 we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of a reporting units fair value from the last quantitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the reporting units goodwill is impaired or performing a quantitative assessment by comparing a reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying amount under the quantitative assessment testing for impairment of goodwill is a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is considered the most indicative of the reporting units’ fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn under the market approach we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for peer group companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company we have weighted the income approach and the market approach at 75 and 25 respectively 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit and the allocation of that fair value to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the event a step two analysis is required is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include primarily but are not limited to discount rate terminal growth rate selection of appropriate peer group companies and control premium applied and forecasts of revenue growth rates gross margins operating margins and working capital requirements the allocation requires analysis to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including among others customer relationships trade names and property and equipment any changes in the judgments estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results although we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may vary significantly and may expose us to material impairment charges in the future 

intangible assets include customer relationships trade names internally developed software and other intangibles intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software these intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 

 56 

indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we take into consideration historical loss experience the overall quality of the receivable portfolio and specifically identified customer risks if actual collections of customer receivables differ from our estimates additional allowances may be required which could have an impact on our results of operations 

income taxes 

deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis this evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

we account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks 

our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates the interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility and our senior secured term loan facility are floating and therefore are subject to fluctuations in order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility we have entered into interest rate derivative agreements to economically hedge a portion of the cash flows associated with the facility our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

w e utilize interest rate caps for the purpose of limiting current and future exposure to interest rate risk on our floatingrate debt under the senior secured term loan facility 

as of december 31 2014  we have ten interest rate cap agreements in effect through january 14 2015 with a combined notional amount of 11500 million which entitled the company to payments from the counterparty of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds a weighted average rate of 24 during the agreement period 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we entered into 14 additional interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional amount of 10000 million  these interest rate cap agreements have not been designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk for gaap accounting purposes the entire 10000 million  notional amount entitles us to payments from the counterparty of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 20  during the agreement period the interest rate cap agreements are effective from january 14 2015 through january 14 2017 see note 7 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional details

our market 

we operate in the us and canadian it market which is a large and growing market according to idc the overall us it market generated approximately 660 billion in sales in 2013 we believe our addressable market in the us in the indirect sales channel represents more than 200 billion in annual sales and for the year ended december 31 2013 our us net sales of 103 billion represented approximately 5 of that highly diverse and fragmented market according to idc the overall canadian it market generated more than 50 billion in sales in 2013 we believe our addressable market in canada in the indirect sales channel represents more than 10 billion in annual sales and for the year ended december 31 2013 our net sales of 475 million in canada represented approximately 4 of that market we believe we have the largest market share in our addressable market with our 2013 net sales exceeding the cumulative north american net sales of our four largest publicly traded sales channel competitors based upon publicly available information for those companies new technologies including cloud virtualization and mobility coupled with the resulting increase in demand for data as well as aging infrastructure are increasingly requiring businesses and institutions to seek integrated solutions to their it needs we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future with enduser demand for business efficiency and productivity driving future it spending growth 

our offerings 

our offerings range from discrete hardware and software products and services to complex integrated solutions that include one or more of these elements we believe our customers increasingly view technology purchases as integrated solutions rather than discrete product and service categories and we estimate that approximately 51 of our net sales in 2013 came from sales of product categories and services typically associated with solutions our hardware products include notebooksmobile devices including tablets network communications enterprise and data storage video monitors printers desktop computers and servers our software products include application suites security virtualization operating systems network management and software as a service “saas” offerings we also provide a full suite of valueaddedservices which range from basic installation warranty and repair services to custom configuration data center and network implementation services as well as managed services that include infrastructure as a service “iaas” offerings

• virtualization  we design and implement server storage and desktop virtualization solutions virtualization enables our customers to efficiently utilize hardware resources by running multiple independent virtual operating systems on a single computer and multiple virtual servers simultaneously on a single server virtualization also can separate a desktop environment and associated application software from the hardware device that is used to access it and provides employees with remote desktop access our specialists assist customers with the steps of implementing virtualization solutions including evaluating network environments deploying shared storage options and licensing platform software

 6 

multiple enterprise communication methods including email instant messaging presence social media voice video hardware software and services we also host cloudbased collaboration solutions 

while we believe customers increasingly view technology purchases as solutions rather than discrete product and service categories the following table shows our net sales by major category based upon our internal category classifications 



  

 our customers 

we provide integrated it solutions to approximately 250000 small medium and large business government education and healthcare customers throughout the us and canada sales to the us federal government which are diversified across multiple agencies and departments collectively accounted for approximately 7  10  and 10  of total net sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively however there are several independent purchasing decisionmakers across these agencies and departments excluding these sales to the federal government we are not reliant on any one customer as our next five largest customers cumulatively comprised approximately 3 of our net sales in 2013 

inventory management 

we utilize our it systems to manage our inventory in a costefficient manner resulting in a rapidturn inventory model we generally only stock items that have attained a minimum sales volume 

our distribution process is highly automated once a customer order is received and credit approved orders are automatically routed to one of our distribution centers for picking and shipping as well as configuration and imaging services we operate two distribution centers an approximately 450000 square foot facility in vernon hills illinois and an approximately 513000 square foot facility in north las vegas nevada we ship almost 35 million units annually on an aggregate basis from our two distribution centers we believe that the location of our distribution centers allows us to efficiently ship products throughout the us and provide timely access to our principal distributors in addition in the event of weatherrelated or other disruptions at one of our distribution centers we are able to shift order processing and fulfillment from one center to the other quickly and efficiently enabling us to continue to ship products in a timely manner we believe that competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of the product categories we offer we continue to improve the productivity of our distribution centers as measured by key performance indicators such as units shipped per hour worked and bin accuracy 

we also have dropshipment arrangements with many of our oems and wholesale distributors which permit us to offer products to our customers without having to take physical delivery at either of our distribution centers these arrangements generally represent approximately 40 to 50 of total net sales including approximately 10 to 15 related to electronic delivery for software licenses 

information technology systems 

we maintain customized it and unified communication systems that enhance our ability to provide prompt efficient and expert service to our customers in addition these systems enable centralized management of key functions including 

 7 

purchasing inventory management billing and collection of accounts receivable sales and distribution our systems provide us with thorough detailed and realtime information regarding key aspects of our business this capability helps us to continuously enhance productivity ship customer orders quickly and efficiently respond appropriately to industry changes and provide high levels of customer service we believe that our websites which provide electronic order processing and advanced tools such as order tracking reporting and asset management make it easy for customers to transact business with us and ultimately strengthen our customer relationships 

product procurement 

we may purchase all or only some of the products that our vendor partners offer for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions which may include one or more of the following product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements we also purchase software from major software publishers for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer our agreements with software publishers allow the enduser customer to acquire software or licensed products and services 

in addition to purchasing products directly from our vendor partners we purchase products from wholesale distributors for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer these wholesale distributors provide logistics management and supplychain services for us as well as for our vendor partners for the year ended december 31 2013 we purchased 54 of the products we sold as discrete products or as components of a solution directly from our vendor partners and the remaining 46 from wholesale distributors purchases from wholesale distributors tech data synnex and ingram micro represented 11 9 and 9 respectively of our total purchases sales of products manufactured by apple cisco emc hewlettpackard lenovo and microsoft whether purchased directly from these vendor partners or from a wholesale distributor represented in the aggregate 56 of our net sales in 2013 sales of products manufactured by hewlettpackard and cisco represented 20 and 14 respectively of our 2013 net sales 

competition 

the market for technology products and services is highly competitive competition is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs quality and breadth of product and service offerings knowledge and expertise of sales force customer service price product availability speed of delivery and credit availability our competition includes 

 we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for a discussion of the risks associated with competition see “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report

marketing 

we market the cdw brand to both national and local audiences using a variety of channels that include online broadcast print social and other media this promotion is supported by integrated communication efforts that target decisionmakers influencers and the general public using a combination of news releases case studies media interviews and speaking opportunities we also market to current and prospective customers through integrated marketing programs that include behaviorally targeted email print online media events and sponsorships as well as broadcast media 

as a result of our relationships with our vendor partners a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising reimbursement programs these programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or purchasing volumes or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time we believe that our national scale and analytical techniques that measure the efficacy of our marketing programs differentiate us from our competitors 

coworkers 

as of december 31 2013 we employed nearly 7000 coworkers none of whom is covered by collective bargaining agreements we consider our coworker relations to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect our business and the results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some important factors that may cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 

risks related to our business 

general economic conditions could negatively affect technology spending by our customers and put downward pressure on prices which may have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

weak economic conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions us federal government spending cuts and the impact of new government programs or a tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

 9 

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public segment customers 

our sales to our public segment customers are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels although our sales to the federal government are diversified across multiple agencies and departments they collectively accounted for approximately 7 of 2013 net sales an adverse change in government spending policies including ongoing budget cuts at the federal level budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows for example in 2013 as a result of sequestration and related budget uncertainty and the partial shutdown of the federal government for 16 days we experienced significantly reduced federal sales in our public segment 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products 

we purchase products for resale from vendor partners which include oems and software publishers and wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2013 we purchased approximately 54 of the products we sold directly from vendor partners and the remaining amount from wholesale distributors we are authorized by vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding including purchase rebates sales volume rebates purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows in addition a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows particularly given our substantial indebtedness 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2013 products we purchased from distributors tech data synnex and ingram micro represented 11 9 and 9 respectively of our total purchases in addition sales of apple cisco emc hewlettpackard lenovo and microsoft products comprise a substantial portion of our sales representing approximately 56 of net sales in 2013 sales of products manufactured by hewlettpackard and cisco represented approximately 20 and 14 respectively of our 2013 net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other key vendor partners the diminished availability of their products or backlogs for their products leading to manufacturer allocation could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position 

additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows further the sale spinoff or combination of any of our vendor partners andor certain of their business units including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services offerings such as cloudbased solutions including saas iaas and platform as a service paas we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services offerings as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers a decrease in the rate of innovation or the lack of acceptance of innovations by customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware software and services offerings for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

 10 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels in addition our success is dependent on our ability to develop relationships with and sell hardware software and services from new emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace to the extent that a vendors offering that is highly in demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels or we are unable to develop relationships with new technology providers or companies that we have not historically represented our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 

   

we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for instance technologies that deliver technology solutions as a service such as cloudbased solutions could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us or could lead to a reduction in our profitability in addition some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to our customers moreover traditional oems have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers if any of these trends becomes more prevalent it could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems including our business systems such as our sales customer management financial and accounting marketing purchasing warehouse management ecommerce and mobile systems as well as our operational platforms including voice and data networks and power systems the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

  11 

   

the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats including computer viruses malware phishing social engineering unauthorized access and other malicious attacks both internal and external and human error there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business and results of operations 

breaches of data security could adversely impact our business 

our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers and others in addition we operate data centers for our customers which host their technology infrastructure and may store and transmit both businesscritical data and confidential information in connection with our services business our coworkers also have access to our customers confidential data and other information we have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however as newer technologies evolve we could be exposed to increased risk of breaches in security breaches in security could expose us our customers or other individuals to a risk of public disclosure loss or misuse of this information resulting in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the failure to comply with our public segment contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things termination fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues from our public segment customers are derived from sales to governmental departments and agencies educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services sales to public segment customers are highly regulated noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including but not limited to the false claims act and the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public segment customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with the government and other customers in the public segment in addition generally contracts in the public segment are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization “gpo” or upon default furthermore our inability to enter into or retain contracts with gpos may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those gpos and compete the effect of any of these possible actions could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we fail to provide highquality services to our customers or if our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our service offerings include field services managed services warranties configuration services partner services and telecom services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers we also offer certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide high quality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers businesses this could among other things result in legal claims and proceedings and liability moreover as we expand our services and solutions business we may be exposed to additional operational regulatory and other risks we also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation with our customers our brand and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract develop engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business including our key executive management sales services and technical coworkers 

 12 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of thomas e richards our chairman and chief executive officer as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers our future success also will depend on our ability to retain our customerfacing coworkers who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with many of our customers in addition as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers for whom the market is extremely competitive 

our inability to attract develop and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and adversely affect our ability to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions moreover our inability to train our sales services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel such consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

a significant portion of the products we sell are manufactured or purchased by our vendor partners outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events that could also cause disruptions to our supply chain include 

   

we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell are purchased or manufactured or may be purchased or manufactured in the future will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargoes sanctions safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell as well as foreign labor strikes and work stoppages or boycotts could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business 

substantially all of our corporate warehouse and distribution functions are located at our vernon hills illinois facilities and our second distribution center in north las vegas nevada if the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence we could utilize the other distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate three customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on commercial delivery services 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes inclement weather natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

 13 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales typically on 30day payment terms we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty or in the case of public segment customers during periods of budget constraints 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request these bulk purchases could increase our exposure to inventory obsolescence 

we could be exposed to additional risks if we make acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may pursue transactions including acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous business risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses any of which could adversely affect our operations 

in addition our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades 

our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including general macroeconomic conditions pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial employment tort and other litigation 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services in the form of ceaseanddesist letters licensing inquiries lawsuits and other communications and demands in our industry such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased increasingly many of these assertions are brought by nonpracticing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue but we may also be subject to suits from inventors competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue lost profits andor an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities including selling certain products and services 

 14 

because of our significant sales to governmental entities we also are subject to audits by federal state and local authorities we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts 

current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any litigation infringement claim governmental proceeding audit or indemnification claim could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we have significant deferred cancellation of debt income 

as a result of a 2009 debt modification we realized 3955 million of cancellation of debt income “codi” we made an election under code section 108i to defer this codi from taxable income pursuant to which we are also required to defer certain original issue discount “oid” deductions as they accrue as of december 31 2013 we had already deferred approximately 1145 million of oid deductions starting in 2014 we will be required to include the deferred codi into taxable income ratably over a fiveyear period ending in 2018 during this same period we will also be permitted to benefit from our deferred oid deductions because we have more codi than the aggregate of our deferred and unaccrued oid on the relevant remaining debt instruments we will have a future cash tax liability associated with our significant deferred codi we have reflected the associated cash tax liability in our deferred taxes for financial accounting purposes 

all of our deferred codi will be accelerated into current taxable income if prior to 2018 we engage in a socalled “impairment transaction” and the gross value of our assets immediately afterward is less than 110 of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred codi and oid the “110 test” as determined under the applicable treasury regulations an “impairment transaction” is any transaction that impairs our ability to pay the tax on our deferred codi and includes dividends or distributions with respect to our equity and charitable contributions in each case in a manner that is not consistent with our historical practice within the meaning of the applicable treasury regulations 

prior to 2018 our willingness to pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our equity could be adversely affected if at the time we do not meet the 110 test and as a result the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution would accelerate the tax payable with respect to our deferred codi we believe that based on our interpretation of applicable treasury regulations the gross value of our assets exceeds 110 of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred codi and oid as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k however we cannot assure you that this will continue to be true in the future 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have important consequences to our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2013 we had 33 billion of total longterm debt outstanding as defined by gaap and 2566 million of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements and the ability to borrow an additional 6411 million under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility the “revolving loan” our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

  15 

 restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit facilities and our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 as a result of these covenants we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs a breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities the lenders 

 if we were unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior credit facilities and our senior secured notes due 2018 if the lenders under our senior credit facilities or the holders of our senior secured notes due 2018 accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness even if we were able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us 

in addition under our revolving loan we are permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of up to 900 million however our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition the borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors’ eligible accounts receivable net of accounts reserves up to 30 of such eligible accounts receivable which can consist of federal government accounts receivable plus the lesser of i 70 of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors’ eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves and ii the product of 85 multiplied by the net orderly liquidation value percentage multiplied by eligible inventory valued at cost and net of inventory reserves less reserves other than accounts reserves and inventory reserves the borrowing base in effect as of december 31 2013 was 10655 million 

 16 

our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is also limited by a minimum liquidity condition which provides that if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of i 90 million or ii the greater of a 10 of the borrowing base or b 60 million the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under our revolving loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving loan is at least 10 to 10 moreover our revolving loan provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability reserves which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us we cannot assure you that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or were it to do so that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity 

we will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and if not successful we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control our outstanding longterm debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us in 2014 and subsequent years and accordingly we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources” included elsewhere in this report 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures sell assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital restructure or refinance our indebtedness or revise or delay our strategic plan we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements including our senior credit facilities and indentures in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations our senior credit facilities and indentures restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due furthermore the sponsors have no obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and as a result 

 despite our indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt including secured debt this could further increase the risks associated with our leverage 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above including our possible inability to service our debt will increase as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 6411 million available for additional borrowing under our revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations net of 22 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit and 2567 million of reserves related to our floorplan subfacility 

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2013 we had 15289 million of variable rate debt outstanding if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to do so in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective 

 17 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment 

the market price for our common stock may be volatile our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock which may be caused by a number of factors many of which we cannot control including the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k and the following 

 in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies including companies in our industry in the past securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility if we were involved in securities litigation we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business 

the sponsors have the ability to control significant corporate activities and their interests may not align with yours 

the sponsors beneficially own approximately 637 of our common stock as of february 28 2014 as a result of their ownership the sponsors so long as they hold a majority of our outstanding common stock will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and through our board of directors the ability to control decisionmaking with respect to our business direction and policies matters over which the sponsors will directly or indirectly exercise control include 

 

even if the sponsors’ ownership of our shares falls below a majority they may continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation the sponsors and their affiliates do not have any obligation to present to us and the sponsors may separately pursue corporate opportunities of which they become aware even if those opportunities are ones that we would have pursued if granted the opportunity 

 18 

future sales of our common stock or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur may depress our stock price 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares as of february 28 2014 there were 171954277 shares of our common stock outstanding the shares of our common stock sold in our initial public offering and secondary offering in 2013 are freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” except that any shares of our common stock that may be acquired by our directors executive officers and other affiliates may be sold only in compliance with certain volume limitations and other restrictions of rule 144 of the securities act 

the remaining shares of our common stock to the extent not previously sold pursuant to an exemption from registration will continue to be “restricted shares” within the meaning of rule 144 of the securities act and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted shares may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 or rule 701 under the securities act 

as of february 28 2014 approximately 119000000 shares of our common stock will continue to have the right to require us to register the sales of their shares under the securities act under the terms of an agreement between us and the holders of these securities 

in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our thenoutstanding shares of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors these provisions 

 our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15 of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition these antitakeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company even if doing so would benefit our stockholders these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire 

 19 

conflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of our largest stockholders 

paul finnegan and robin selati who are principals of madison dearborn and glenn creamer and michael dominguez who are managing directors of providence equity serve on our board of directors as of february 28 2014 the sponsors continue to hold a majority of our outstanding common stock the sponsors and the entities respectively controlled by them may hold equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us and companies in which they currently invest may begin competing with us as a result of these relationships when conflicts arise between the interests of madison dearborn or providence equity on the one hand and of other stockholders on the other hand these directors may not be disinterested although our directors and officers have a duty of loyalty to us under delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible so long as 1 the material facts relating to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our board of directors and a majority of our disinterested directors approves the transaction 2 the material facts relating to the director’s or officer’s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our stockholders and a majority of our disinterested stockholders approve the transaction or 3 the transaction is otherwise fair to us our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that any principal officer member manager andor employee of a sponsor or any entity that controls is controlled by or under common control with a sponsor other than us or any company that is controlled by us or a sponsormanaged investment fund will not be required to offer any transaction opportunity of which they become aware to us and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment unless such opportunity is offered to them solely in their capacities as our directors 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock if we do not continue to pay dividends you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price 

in each of the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 00425 per share of common stock we expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock of 00425 per share per quarter or 017 per share per annum any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations financial condition business prospects capital requirements contractual restrictions including those under our senior credit facilities and indentures any potential indebtedness we may incur restrictions imposed by applicable law tax considerations and other factors our board of directors deems relevant there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all accordingly if we do not pay dividends in the future realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur see “risks related to our businesswe have significant deferred cancellation of debt income” for a discussion of certain tax considerations that could affect our willingness to pay dividends in the future  

we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 

we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us the deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial intellectual property employment tort and other litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state and local authorities and by various partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws in such cases certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

as of december 31 2013 we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters if any has been incurred however the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable as such our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters 

we previously filed a claim as part of a class action settlement in a case alleging price fixing during the period of january 1 1996 through december 31 2006 by certain manufacturers of thinfilm liquid crystal display panels on july 13 2013 the united stated district court for the northern district of california approved distribution of the settlement proceeds including a net payment to us of 104 million after fees and expenses we have recognized a pretax benefit of 104 million within selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 the first of two settlement payments was received by us on july 29 2013 in the amount of 85 million the balance of 19 million was received in february 2014

trends and key factors affecting our financial performance 

we believe the following trends may have an important impact on our financial performance 

  31

on july 2 2013 we completed an initial public offering ipo of 23250000 shares of common stock on july 31 2013 we completed the sale of an additional 3487500 shares of common stock to the underwriters of the ipo pursuant to the underwriters july 26 2013 exercise in full of the overallotment option granted to them in connection with the ipo our shares of common stock were sold to the underwriters at a price of 1700 per share in the ipo and upon the exercise of the overallotment option which together generated aggregate net proceeds of 4247 million to the company after deducting underwriting discounts expenses and transaction costs

key business metrics 

our management monitors a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin net income nongaap net income net income per common share nongaap net income per diluted share ebitda and adjusted ebitda return on invested capital cash and cash equivalents net working capital cash conversion cycle defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios sales per coworker and coworker turnover these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management so that actions can be taken as necessary in order to achieve the standards and objectives nongaap net income and adjusted ebitda are nongaap financial measures we believe these measures provide helpful information with respect to the company’s operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures dividend payments and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our senior credit facilities see selected financial data included elsewhere in this report for the definitions of nongaap net income and adjusted ebitda and reconciliations to net income

the results of certain key business metrics are as follows 



 results of operations 

year ended december 31 2013 compared to year ended december 31 2012 

the following table presents our results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012    



 33 

net sales 

the following table presents our net sales by segment in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012  



 the following table presents our net sales by customer channel for our corporate and public segments and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012  



total net sales in 2013 increased 6404 million  or 63  to 107686 million  compared to 101282 million  in 2012 there were 254  selling days for both the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012  the increase in total net sales was primarily the result of growth in hardware and software a more tenured sales force a continued focus on seller productivity across all areas of the organization and the addition of nearly 120 customerfacing coworkers the majority in pre and postsale technical positions such as technical specialists and service delivery roles our total net sales growth for the year ended december 31 2013  reflected growth in notebooksmobile devices netcomm products and software software gains were driven by growth in security document management software and network management software partially offset by a decline in application suites 

corporate segment net sales in 2013 increased 4473 million  or 81  compared to 2012 driven by sales growth in the mediumlarge customer channel within our corporate segment net sales to mediumlarge customers increased 102  between years primarily due to certain of these customers increasing their it spending a more tenured sales force a continued focus on seller productivity and additional customerfacing coworkers the majority in pre and postsale technical positions such as technical specialists and service delivery roles this increase was led by unit volume growth in netcomm products and growth in notebooksmobile devices and software partially offsetting the growth in the mediumlarge customer channel was a 06  decline in net sales to small business customers due to certain of these customers taking a more cautious approach to spending as macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty impacted decisionmaking this decrease was led by unit volume declines in notebooksmobile devices partially offset by growth in netcomm products 

public segment net sales in 2013 increased 1415 million  or 35  between years driven by strong performance in the education customer channel net sales to education customers increased 2567 million  or 215  between years led by growth in net sales to k12 customers reflecting increased sales of notebooksmobile devices to support new standardized digital testing requirements that will take effect in 2014 net sales to government customers decreased 1435 million  or 

 34 

103  in 2013 compared to 2012 due to reductions and delays in federal government spending following sequestration uncertainty over future budget negotiations and the partial shutdown of the federal government the government customer channel net sales decline was led by decreases in sales of enterprise storage and notebooksmobile devices partially offset by growth in software net sales to healthcare customers increased 283 million  or 20  between years driven by growth in notebooksmobile devices and desktop computers 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 907 million  or 54  to 17603 million  in 2013 compared to 16696 million  in 2012 as a percentage of total net sales gross profit decreased 20 basis points to 163  in 2013 down from 165  in 2012 gross profit margin was negatively impacted 30 basis points by unfavorable pricemix changes within product margin as we experienced product margin compression in transactional product categories such as desktops and notebooks partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of 10 basis points due to a higher mix of net service contract revenue net service contract revenue including items such as thirdparty services and warranties has a positive impact on gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 

the gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix net service contract revenue commission revenue pricing strategies market conditions and other factors any of which could result in changes in gross profit margins 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 914 million  or 89  to 11209 million  in 2013 compared to 10295 million  in 2012 as a percentage of total net sales selling and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 104  in 2013 up from 102  in 2012 sales payroll including sales commissions and other variable compensation costs increased 289 million or 64 between years consistent with higher sales and gross profit additionally selling and administrative expenses for 2013 included ipo and secondaryoffering related expenses of 750 million  as follows 

 

we did not record any ipo or secondaryoffering related expenses during 2012 partially offsetting these increases in 2013 was the favorable resolution of a class action legal proceeding in which we were a claimant which reduced selling and administrative expenses by 104 million in 2013 compared to 2012 total coworker count increased by 163 coworkers from 6804 at december 31 2012 to 6967 at december 31 2013 

advertising expense 

advertising expense increased 13 million  or 09  to 1308 million  in 2013 compared to 1295 million  in 2012 as a percentage of net sales advertising expense was 12  in 2013 compared to 13  in 2012 the dollar increase in advertising expense was due to a continued focus on advertising our solutions and products which reinforces our reputation as a leading it solutions provider 

 35 

income from operations 

the following table presents income loss from operations by segment in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change in income loss from operations for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012  



  

 not meaningful 

 income from operations was 5086 million  in 2013 a decrease of 20 million  or 04  compared to 5106 million  in 2012 the decrease in income from operations was driven by higher selling and administrative expenses primarily resulting from 750 million  of ipo and secondaryoffering related expenses recorded during 2013 mostly offset by higher net sales and gross profit total operating margin percentage decreased 30 basis points to 47  in 2013 from 50  in 2012 operating margin percentage was negatively impacted by the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales and gross profit margin compression partially offset by a decrease in advertising expense as a percentage of net sales 

corporate segment income from operations was 3633 million  in 2013 an increase of 143 million  or 41  compared to 3490 million  in 2012 corporate segment operating margin percentage decreased 20 basis points to 61  in   2013 from 63 in 2012 results for 2013 included 264 million of ipo and secondaryoffering related expenses which reduced corporate segment operating margin by 40 basis points higher sales and gross profit dollars offset the effect of ipo and secondaryoffering related expenses on income from operations for 2013 

public segment income from operations was 2465 million  in 2013 a decrease of 02 million  or 01  compared to 2467 million  in 2012 public segment operating margin percentage decreased 20 basis points to 59  in   2013 from 61 in 2012 results for 2013 included 144 million of ipo and secondaryoffering related expenses which reduced public segment operating margin by 30 basis points higher sales and gross profit dollars nearly offset the effect of ipo and secondaryoffering related expenses on income from operations for 2013 

interest expense net 

at december 31 2013  our outstanding longterm debt totaled 32512 million compared to 37710 million at december 31 2012 we reduced longterm debt throughout the year primarily through the use of a portion of the net proceeds from the ipo and cash flows provided by operating activities net interest expense in 2013 was 2501 million  a decrease of 573 million  compared to 3074 million  in 2012 this decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances and effective interest rates for 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of debt repayments and refinancing activities completed during 2012 and 2013 see liquidity and capital resources below 

net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt 

during 2013 we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt of 640 million  compared to 172 million in 2012 

in october 2013 we redeemed 1550 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes in connection with this redemption we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 85 million representing the difference 

 36 

between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in august 2013 we redeemed 3240 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes in connection with this redemption we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 246 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in july 2013 we redeemed 1750 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes in connection with this redemption we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 167 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in april 2013 we entered into a new sevenyear 13500 million aggregate principal amount senior secured term loan facility substantially all of the proceeds were used to repay the 12995 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the prior senior secured term loan facility in connection with this refinancing we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 103 million representing a writeoff of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs related to the prior senior secured term loan facility 

in march 2013 we redeemed 500 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 39 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in december 2012 we redeemed 1000 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 78 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in february and march 2012 we purchased or redeemed the remaining 1290 million of senior notes due 2015 funded with the issuance of an additional 1300 million of senior notes due 2019 as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 94 million representing the difference between the purchase or redemption price of the senior notes due 2015 and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs 

income tax expense 

income tax expense was 627 million  in 2013 compared to 671 million  in 2012 the effective income tax rate expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes was 321  and 360  for 2013 and 2012 respectively 

for 2013 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes including current year state income tax credits and an adjustment to deferred state income taxes due to changes in apportionment factors for 2012 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable adjustments to state tax credits which were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of adjustments to deferred state income taxes due to changes in state tax laws and nondeductible expenses primarily equitybased compensation and meals and entertainment the lower effective tax rate for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily driven by the favorable impact of adjustments to deferred state income taxes due to changes in state tax apportionment factors and lower nondeductible expenses 

net income 

net income was 1328 million  in 2013 compared to 1190 million  in 2012 significant factors and events causing the net changes between the periods are discussed above 

nongaap net income 

nongaap net income was 3143 million  for the year ended december 31 2013 an increase of 672 million  or 272  compared to 2471 million  for the year ended december 31 2012 

 37 

we have included a reconciliation of nongaap net income for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 below nongaap net income excludes among other things charges related to the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles noncash equitybased compensation ipo and secondaryoffering related expenses and gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt nongaap net income is considered a nongaap financial measure generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures we believe that nongaap net income provides helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements 



 

 adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 8085 million  in 2013 an increase of 419 million  or 55  compared to 7666 million  in 2012 as a percentage of net sales adjusted ebitda was 75  and 76  in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2013 and 2012 in the table below ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used 

 38 

by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements 

  

 the following table sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012

corporate segment net sales in 2012 increased 1784 million or 33 compared to 2011 within our corporate segment net sales to mediumlarge customers increased 38 between years and net sales to small business customers increased 16 between years customers within the corporate segment continued to take a more cautious approach to spending as increased macroeconomic uncertainty impacted decisionmaking and led to some customers delaying purchases the increases in corporate segment net sales were primarily a result of hardware growth most notably in netcomm products and unit volume growth in desktop computers software product growth led by network management and security software also contributed to the increase in net sales partially offsetting the growth was a decline in net sales of memory products due to several large orders in the second and third quarters of 2011 that did not recur 

public segment net sales in 2012 increased 2658 million or 71 between years driven by continued strong performance in the healthcare customer channel net sales to healthcare customers increased 2206 million or 181 between years led by hardware growth most notably in enterprise storage and unit volume growth in netcomm products desktop computers and point of care technology carts software product growth also contributed to the increase in net sales in healthcare the healthcare customer channel growth was primarily the result of deeper relationships with several group purchasing organizations and increased healthcare industry demand for it products as the healthcare industry continued its adoption of electronic medical records and point of care technologies net sales to government customers increased 506 million or 38 in 2012 compared to 2011 led by unit volume increases in sales of notebooksmobile devices partially offset by a decline in net sales of netcomm products net sales to education customers decreased 54 million or 04 between years reflecting budget constraints a decline in sales to k12 customers was partially offset by growth in sales to higher education customers that was led by increased sales of netcomm products as higher education customers refreshed and added additional enterprise technology

selling and administrative expenses increased 394 million or 40 to 10295 million in 2012 compared to 9901 million in 2011 as a percentage of total net sales selling and administrative expenses decreased 10 basis points to 102 in 2012 down from 103 in 2011 the dollar increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs excluding bonus compensation tied to adjusted ebitda of 430 million the higher payroll costs reflected in selling and administrative expenses were driven by increased sales commissions and other variable compensation costs consistent with higher sales and gross profit while total coworker count increased by 59 coworkers from 6745 coworkers at december 31 2011 to 6804 coworkers at december 31 2012 the increase was primarily comprised of service delivery coworkers the cost of which is reflected in cost of sales other factors that increased selling and administrative expenses included a 58 million increase in health benefits due to higher claims costs and a higher average number of participants in 2012 compared to 2011 a 53 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to additional capital expenditures for information technology systems and a 26 million increase in stock compensation expense primarily due to incremental expense related to a modified class b common unit grant agreement with our former chief executive officer partially offsetting these increases was an 118 million decline in bonus compensation tied to adjusted ebitda as performance fell below target 38 million of expenses related to the modification of our senior secured term loan facility in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 and a 33 million decline in litigation expenses between years 

the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales of 10 basis points between years was driven by the decline in incentive compensation tied to adjusted ebitda performance 

advertising expense 

advertising expense increased 68 million or 56 to 1295 million in 2012 compared to 1227 million in 2011 as a percentage of net sales advertising expense was 13 in both 2012 and 2011 the increase in advertising expense was due to a focus on continuing to advertise our solutions and products and to build our reputation as a leading it solutions provider primarily through targeted digital advertising partially offset by decreases in expenditures for print advertising 

income from operations 

the following table presents income loss from operations by segment in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change in income loss from operations for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 



  

 not meaningful 

 income from operations was 5106 million in 2012 an increase of 399 million or 85 compared to 4707 million in 2011 this increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses and advertising expense total operating margin percentage increased 10 basis points to 50 in 2012 

 42 

compared to 49 in 2011 operating margin percentage was positively impacted by the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 

corporate segment income from operations was 3490 million in 2012 an increase of 174 million or 52 compared to 3316 million in 2011 this increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit margin partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses resulting in a net increase in segment operating income before allocations of 144 million in 2012 compared to 2011 in addition corporate segment income from operations benefited from an increase of 25 million in income allocations from our logistics operations and a decrease of 05 million in headquarters expense allocations in 2012 compared to 2011 the improved profitability of our logistics operations was driven by stronger operating leverage given higher purchase volumes while support costs remained flat 

public segment income from operations was 2467 million in 2012 an increase of 134 million or 57 compared to 2333 million in 2011 this increase reflected higher segment operating income before allocations of 40 million as a result of increased net sales and gross profit dollars partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs in addition public segment income from operations benefited from an increase of 57 million in income allocations from our logistics operations and a decrease in headquarters’ expense allocations of 37 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

interest expense net 

at december 31 2012 our outstanding longterm debt totaled 37710 million compared to 40660 million at december 31 2011 net interest expense in 2012 was 3074 million a decrease of 168 million compared to 3242 million in 2011 interest expense in 2011 included a benefit of 194 million due to an adjustment to the longterm accrued interest liability associated with the extinguishment of 10780 million of senior notes due 2015 the longterm accrued interest liability represents the difference between interest expense previously recognized under the effective interest method and actual interest paid of the remaining net decrease of 362 million 272 million was due to lower effective interest rates and lower debt balances in 2012 compared to the prior year as a result of debt repayment and refinancing activities completed during 2011 and 2012 the remaining net decrease was primarily attributable to additional interest expense in 2011 related to the interest rate swaps that terminated in january 2011 higher 2011 marktomarket losses on interest rate caps higher amortization of deferred financing costs in 2011 compared to 2012 and a 2012 benefit related to an adjustment to the longterm accrued interest liability associated with the extinguishment of 1000 million of senior subordinated notes due 2017 

net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt 

during 2012 we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt of 172 million compared to 1189 million in 2011 

in february and march 2012 we purchased or redeemed the remaining 1290 million of senior notes due 2015 funded with the issuance of an additional 1300 million of senior notes due 2019 as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 94 million representing the difference between the purchase or redemption price of the senior notes due 2015 and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs 

in december 2012 we redeemed 1000 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 78 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in march 2011 we amended our senior secured term loan facility and recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 32 million representing a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs on this facility 

in april and may 2011 we purchased 10780 million of senior notes due 2015 funded with the issuance of 11750 million of senior notes due 2019 as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 1141 million representing the difference between the purchase price of the senior notes due 2015 at 109 of principal amount and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in june 2011 we entered into a new 9000 million senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility replacing the existing 8000 million facility as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 16 million representing a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the previous facility 

income tax expense 

income tax expense was 671 million in 2012 compared to 112 million in 2011 the effective income tax rate was 360 and 397 for 2012 and 2011 respectively 

 43 

for 2012 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable adjustments to state tax credits which are partially offset by the unfavorable impact of adjustments to deferred taxes due to changes in state tax laws and permanent differences for 2011 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable impact of permanent differences offset by a benefit for state income taxes the lower effective tax rate for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily driven by the impact of favorable adjustments to state tax credits in 2012 and the lower rate impact of permanent differences in 2012 due to the significantly greater amount of pretax income 

net income 

net income was 1190 million in 2012 compared to 171 million in 2011 the 2012 and 2011 results included after tax losses on extinguishments of longterm debt of 105 million and 725 million respectively other significant factors and events causing the net changes from 2011 to 2012 are discussed above 

nongaap net income 

nongaap net income was 2471 million for the year ended december 31 2012 an increase of 483 million or 243 compared to 1988 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

we have included a reconciliation of nongaap net income for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 below nongaap net income excludes among other things charges related to the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles noncash equitybased compensation and gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt nongaap net income is considered a nongaap financial measure generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures we believe that nongaap net income provides helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements 



 

 adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 7666 million in 2012 an increase of 493 million or 69 compared to 7173 million in 2011 as a percentage of net sales adjusted ebitda was 76 and 75 in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2012 and 2011 in the table below ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either 

 44 

excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements see “selected financial data” included elsewhere in this report for a reconciliation of ebitda to cash flows from operating activities 

  

 the following table sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011   



 45 

seasonality 

while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year sales in our corporate segment which primarily serves private sector business customers are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year additionally sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we finance our operations and capital expenditures through a combination of internally generated cash from operations and from borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility we believe that our current sources of funds will be sufficient to fund our cash operating requirements for the next year in addition we believe that in spite of the uncertainty of future macroeconomic conditions we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available to meet our longerterm needs however there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions 

on july 2 2013 we completed an ipo of 23250000 shares of common stock on july 31 2013 we completed the sale of an additional 3487500 shares of common stock to the underwriters of the ipo pursuant to the underwriters july 26 2013 exercise in full of the overallotment option granted to them in connection with the ipo such shares were registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended pursuant to our registration statement on form s1 which was declared effective by the sec on june 26 2013 our shares of common stock are listed on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “cdw” our shares of common stock were sold to the underwriters at a price of 1700 per share in the ipo and upon the exercise of the overallotment option which together generated aggregate net proceeds of 4247 million  to us after deducting underwriting discounts expenses and transaction costs 

using a portion of the net proceeds from the ipo we paid a 244 million termination fee to affiliates of the sponsors in connection with the termination of the management services agreement with such entities that was effective upon completion of the ipo and redeemed 1750 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2018 the redemption price of the senior secured notes due 2018 was 1080 of the principal amount redeemed plus 07 million of accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption we used cash on hand to pay such accrued and unpaid interest in connection with this redemption we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 167 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 this loss represented 140 million in redemption premium and 27 million for the writeoff of a portion of the remaining deferred financing costs related to the senior secured notes due 2018 

on august 1 2013 we redeemed 3240 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due 2017 we used a portion of the net proceeds from the ipo to redeem 1460 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due 2017 and incremental borrowings of 1900 million under the senior secured term loan facility to redeem 1780 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due 2017 the redemption price of the senior subordinated notes due 2017 was 106268 of the principal amount redeemed plus 120 million of accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption we used cash on hand to pay such accrued and unpaid interest in connection with this redemption we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 246 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 this loss represented 203 million in redemption premium and 43 million for the writeoff of a portion of the remaining deferred financing costs related to the senior subordinated notes due 2017 

on october 18 2013 we redeemed 1550 million  aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due 2017 at a redemption price that was 104178  of the principal amount redeemed plus 02 million in accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption we used a combination of cash on hand and the net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock related to the underwriters july 26 2013 exercise in full of the overallotment option granted to them in connection with the ipo in the amount of 560 million to redeem the 1550 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due 2017 including the redemption premium and accrued and unpaid interest in connection with this redemption we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 85 million  in the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december 31 2013 this loss represented 65 million  in redemption premium and 20 million  for the writeoff of a portion of the remaining deferred financing costs related to the senior subordinated notes due 2017 see subsequent events below for a description of refinancing transactions completed during 2014 

 46 

on december 2 2013 we paid a cash dividend on our common stock of 00425 per share to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on november 15 2013

in connection with the establishment of the mpk incentive plan ii the “mpk plan” in 2007 we agreed to make charitable contributions in amounts equal to the net income tax benefits derived from payouts to participants under the mpk plan net of any related employer payroll tax costs as of december 31 2013 we have accrued approximately 21 million related to this arrangement within other current liabilities we expect to make the related cash contribution during the first quarter of 2014 see note 10 of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this arrangement 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities were as follows 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 increased 489 million compared to 2012 net income adjusted for the impact of noncash items such as depreciation and amortization equitybased compensation expense and net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt was 4134 million during 2013 compared to 3268 million during 2012 an increase of 866 million the increase in cash of 866 million reflected stronger operating results in 2013 compared to 2012 net changes in assets and liabilities reduced cash by 471 million in 2013 compared to a reduction of 94 million in 2012 resulting in a change of 377 million between periods while changes in assets and liabilities were relatively flat during 2012 during 2013 accounts receivable and accounts payable balances decreased and increased cash by 1708 million and 1461 million respectively primarily as a result of accelerated sales growth during the final month of 2013 merchandise inventory also increased during 2013 to support strong sales order volume near the end of 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2012 increased 1027 million  compared to 2011 the increase was primarily driven by changes in assets and liabilities resulting in a 1489 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities between periods despite a 2012 fourth quarter increase in net sales of 49 between years accounts receivable remained relatively flat from the prior year end driven by improved collection results particularly within the public segment accounts receivable in 2011 represented a use of cash of 1834 million primarily due to a 2011 fourth quarter increase in net sales of 93 from the same period in the prior year merchandise inventory also contributed 361 million of the increase in cash between years driven by a return to more normalized inventory levels in 2012 following the buildup at the end of 2011 related to the hard drive shortage from the thailand floods along with a higher percentage of drop shipments from vendor partners and distributors in 2012 compared to 2011 partially offsetting these factors in 2012 was a 541 million decrease in other assets as we collected 533 million in income tax refunds in 2011 that did not repeat in 2012 net income adjusted for the impact of noncash items such as losses on extinguishment of longterm debt was 3268 million in 2012 compared to 3730 million in 2011 or a decrease of 462 million improved operating performance in 2012 drove higher net income between years but also higher net cash income taxes paid net cash income taxes paid in 2012 were 1232 million compared to a net 

 47 

cash tax refund of 209 million in 2011 in addition to the 533 million in cash tax refunds received in 2011 we also fully utilized our remaining federal net operating tax loss carryforwards during 2011 

in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs we monitor our cash conversion cycle defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable based on a rolling threemonth average the following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle 



 the cash conversion cycle remained flat at 24 days for both december 31 2013 and 2012 the increase in dso was primarily driven by an increase in receivables for thirdparty services such as software assurance and warranties these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the statement of operations is recorded on a net basis the dpo increase was primarily due to an increase in payables for thirdparty services which offsets the related increase in dso discussed above these services have a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sales in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales the timing of quarterend payments also had a favorable impact on dpo at december 31 2013 the increase in dio was primarily due to an increase in inventory to support strong sales order volume near the end of 2013 

the cash conversion cycle decreased to 24 days at december 31 2012 compared to 28 days at december 31 2011 driven by improvements in dso and dio the dso decline was primarily related to improved collections in the public segment the dio decline was primarily related to an increase in the percentage of products delivered to customers via dropshipment in 2012 compared to 2011 which had the effect of increasing cost of sales without a corresponding increase in inventoryrelated working capital 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities increased 54 million in 2013 compared to 2012 capital expenditures were 471 million and 414 million for 2013 and 2012 respectively primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years 

net cash used in investing activities in 2012 decreased 143 million  compared to 2011 this decline was primarily due to a reduction in cash payments between years of 66 million related to interest rate swap agreements as the 66 million paid in 2011 reflected the final payment upon termination of the swap agreements on january 14 2011 capital expenditures were 414 million  and 457 million for 2012 and 2011 respectively primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years during 2012 and 2011 we paid 03 million  and 37 million respectively for new interest rate cap agreements 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 1697 million in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease was primarily driven by various debt transactions during each period and our july 2013 ipo which generated net proceeds of 4247 million  after deducting underwriting discounts expenses and transaction costs the net impact of our debt transactions resulted in cash outflows of 5694 million and 3106 million during 2013 and 2012 respectively as cash was used in each period to reduce 

 48 

our total longterm debt debt transactions impacting each period presented are described below under longterm debt and financing arrangements 

net cash used in financing activities increased 2426 million  in 2012 compared to 2011 this change was primarily driven by 2011 net inflows from accounts payableinventory financing of 2505 million compared to 2012 outflows of 295 million resulting in a total impact on the change in cash used in financing activities of 2800 million  from accounts payableinventory financing the reduction in cash during 2012 from accounts payableinventory financing was primarily due to the termination of one of our inventory financing agreements in the first quarter of 2012 with amounts owed for subsequent purchases being included in accounts payabletrade on the consolidated balance sheet and classified as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows as discussed below under “inventory financing arrangements” in june 2011 we entered into a new inventory financing agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from a certain vendor inventory purchases from this vendor under the june 2011 inventory financing agreement are included in accounts payableinventory financing and reported as cash flows from financing activities the net impact of our debt transactions resulted in cash outflows of 3106 million  during 2012 and 3465 million  during 2011 as cash was used in each period to reduce our total longterm debt debt transactions impacting each period presented are described below under longterm debt and financing arrangements 

longterm debt and financing arrangements 

longterm debt was as follows 



1 interest rate at december 31 2013 

at december 31 2013  we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures as described below under the indentures governing the 85 senior notes due 2019 and 80 senior secured notes due 2018 which contain the most restrictive restricted payment provisions in our various credit agreements and indentures cdw llc and its restricted subsidiaries are generally restricted from paying dividends and making other restricted payments unless cdw llc could incur an additional dollar of indebtedness under its fixed charges ratio covenant and the amount of such dividend or other restricted payment together with the amount of all other dividends and restricted payments made from january 1 2011 through the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter is less than the sum of 50 of cumulative consolidated net income or 100 of any consolidated net loss incurred over the period plus the amount of certain other items occurring during that period that increase and in some cases decrease the amounts available for such payments for the purpose of determining restricted payment capacity consolidated net income or loss includes certain adjustments that are defined in the indentures at december 31 2013 the amount of cumulative consolidated net income free of restrictions under the credit agreements and indentures restricted payment capacity was 1480 million however the transactions described below under subsequent events have since reduced the restricted payment capacity to approximately 89 million 

senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “revolving loan” 

at december 31 2013 we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan 22 million of undrawn letters of credit and 2567 million reserved related to the floorplan subfacility 

on june 24 2011 we entered into the revolving loan a fiveyear 9000 million senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility with the facility being available to us for borrowings issuance of letters of credit and floorplan financing for certain vendor products the revolving loan matures on june 24 2016 the revolving loan replaced our previous revolving loan credit facility that was to mature on october 12 2012 in connection with the termination of the 

 49 

previous facility we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 16 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 representing a writeoff of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs fees of 72 million related to the revolving loan were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the term of the facility on a straightline basis 

as described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers in connection with the floorplan subfacility we entered into the revolving loan inventory financing agreement amounts outstanding under the revolving loan inventory financing agreement are unsecured and noninterest bearing we will either pay the outstanding revolving loan inventory financing agreement amounts when they become due or the revolving loans administrative agent will automatically initiate an advance on the revolving loan and use the proceeds to pay the balance on the due date at december 31 2013 the financial intermediary reported an outstanding balance of 2468 million under the revolving loan inventory financing agreement the total amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payableinventory financing related to the revolving loan inventory financing agreement is 93 million more than the 2468 million owed to the financial intermediary due to differences in the timing of reporting activity under the revolving loan inventory financing agreement the outstanding balance reported by the financial intermediary excludes 99 million in reserves for open orders that reduce the availability under the revolving loan changes in cash flows from the revolving loan inventory financing agreement are reported in financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

borrowings under the revolving loan bear interest at a variable interest rate plus an applicable margin the variable interest rate is based on one of two indices either i libor or ii the alternate base rate “abr” with the abr being the greatest of a the prime rate b the federal funds effective rate plus 50 basis points or c the onemonth libor plus 100 the applicable margin varies 200 to 250 for libor borrowings and 100 to 150 for abr borrowings depending upon our average daily excess cash availability under the agreement and is subject to a reduction of 025 if and for as long as the senior secured leverage ratio is less than 30 the senior secured leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of senior secured debt including amounts owed under certain inventory floorplan arrangements less cash and cash equivalents to adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters for the four quarters ended december 31 2013  the senior secured leverage ratio was 21  

availability under the revolving loan is limited to a the lesser of the revolving commitment of 9000 million and the amount of the borrowing base less b outstanding borrowings letters of credit and amounts outstanding under the revolving loan inventory financing agreement plus a reserve of 15 of open orders the borrowing base is a the sum of the products of the applicable advance rates on eligible accounts receivable and on eligible inventory as defined in the agreement less b any reserves at december 31 2013 the borrowing base was 10655 million based on the amount of eligible inventory and accounts receivable balances as of november 30 2013 we could have borrowed up to an additional 6411 million under the revolving loan at december 31 2013 the fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan ranges from 25 basis points to either 375 or 50 basis points depending on the amount of utilization 

cdw llc is the borrower under the revolving loan all obligations under the revolving loan are guaranteed by parent and each of cdw llcs direct and indirect 100 owned domestic subsidiaries borrowings under the revolving loan are collateralized by a first priority interest in inventory excluding inventory collateralized under the inventory floorplan arrangements as described in note 5 deposits and accounts receivable and a second priority interest in substantially all other assets the revolving loan contains negative covenants that among other things place restrictions and limitations on the ability of parent and each of cdw llcs direct and indirect 100 owned domestic subsidiaries to dispose of assets incur additional indebtedness incur guarantee obligations prepay other indebtedness make distributions or other restricted payments create liens make equity or debt investments make acquisitions engage in mergers or consolidations or engage in certain transactions with affiliates the revolving loan also includes maintenance of a minimum average daily excess cash availability requirement should we fall below the minimum average daily excess cash availability requirement for five consecutive business days we become subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio until such time as the daily excess cash availability requirement is met for 30 consecutive business days 

senior secured term loan facility 

on april 29 2013 we entered into a new sevenyear 13500 million  aggregate principal amount senior secured term loan facility the term loan the term loan was issued at a price that was 9975  of par which resulted in a discount of 34 million  substantially all of the proceeds from the term loan were used to repay the 12995 million  outstanding aggregate principal amount of the prior senior secured term loan facility the prior term loan facility in connection with this refinancing we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 103 million  in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 this loss represented a writeoff of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs related to the prior term loan facility 

 50

we have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments operating leases and asset retirement obligations the following table presents our estimated future payments under contractual obligations that existed as of december 31 2013 based on undiscounted amounts 

 54 



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

inflation 

inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results we generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing we also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements and by accelerating our overall cash conversion cycle there can be no assurances however that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future 

commitments and contingencies 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial intellectual property employment tort and other litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state and local authorities and by various partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws in such cases certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

as of december 31 2013 we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters if any has been incurred however the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable as such our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters 

we previously filed a claim as part of a class action settlement in a case alleging price fixing during the period of january 1 1996 through december 31 2006 by certain manufacturers of thinfilm liquid crystal display panels on july 13 2013 the united stated district court for the northern district of california approved distribution of the settlement proceeds including a net payment to us of 104 million after fees and expenses we have recognized a pretax benefit of 104 million within selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 

 55

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

in note 1 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers including oems software publishers and wholesale distributors we record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale delivery has occurred andor services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our shipping terms typically specify fob destination at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

revenues from the sales of hardware products and software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales these items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways including i as physical product shipped from our warehouse ii via dropshipment by the vendor or supplier or iii via electronic delivery for software licenses at the time of sale we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience our vendor partners warrant most of the products we sell 

we leverage dropshipment arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs we recognize revenue for dropshipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify fob destination we recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer we set the price of the product charged to the customer we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced and we work closely with our customers to determine their hardware and software specifications these arrangements generally represent approximately 40 to 50 of total net sales including approximately 10 to 15 related to electronic delivery for software licenses 

revenue from professional services is either recognized as provided for services billed at an hourly rate or recognized using a proportional performance model for services provided at a fixed fee revenue from cloud computing solutions including software as a service saas and infrastructure as a service iaas arrangements as well as data center services such as managed and remote managed services server colocation internet connectivity and data backup and storage is recognized over the period service is provided 

we also sell certain products for which we act as an agent products in this category include the sale of thirdparty services warranties software assurance “sa” and thirdparty hosted saas and iaas arrangements sa is a product that allows customers to upgrade at no additional cost to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the sa is in effect these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale under net sales recognition the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 

our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements “eas” under eas customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year regardless of changes to their employee base customers are charged an annual trueup fee for changes in the number of users over the year with most eas our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and 

 56 

there is no corresponding cost of sales amount in certain instances we bill the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer 

from time to time we sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of the products and services for each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element the allocated arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above selling prices are determined by using vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists otherwise selling prices are determined using third party evidence “tpe” if neither vsoe or tpe is available we use our best estimate of selling prices 

we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a cost of sales 

deferred revenue includes 1 payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services and 2 amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met   

we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales intransit to customers at the end of each period based on a weightedaverage analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes dropshipment arrangements this analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount of sales intransit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been received by the customer changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period 

inventory valuation 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value cost is determined using a weightedaverage cost method price protection is recorded when earned as a reduction to the cost of inventory we decrease the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand specifically known inventoryrelated risks and assumptions about future demand and market conditions if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

vendor programs 

we receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates bid programs price protection and other programs these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory depending on the nature of the incentive vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs which could have an impact on our results of operations 

we record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets if actual performance does not match our estimates we may be required to adjust our receivables we record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors’ inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims however if actual collections differ from our estimates we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 

 57 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments we are required to perform an evaluation of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment the annual test for impairment is conducted as of december 1 we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of a reporting units fair value from the last quantitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the reporting units goodwill is impaired or performing a quantitative assessment by comparing a reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying amount under the quantitative assessment testing for impairment of goodwill is a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is considered the most indicative of the reporting units’ fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn under the market approach we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for peer group companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company we have weighted the income approach and the market approach at 75 and 25 respectively 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit and the allocation of that fair value to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the event a step two analysis is required is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include primarily but are not limited to discount rate terminal growth rate selection of appropriate peer group companies and control premium applied and forecasts of revenue growth rates gross margins operating margins and working capital requirements the allocation requires analysis to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including among others customer relationships trade names and property and equipment any changes in the judgments estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results although we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may vary significantly and may expose us to material impairment charges in the future 

intangible assets include customer relationships trade names internally developed software and other intangibles intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software these intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we take into consideration historical loss experience the overall quality of the receivable portfolio and specifically identified customer risks if actual collections of customer receivables differ from our estimates additional allowances may be required which could have an impact on our results of operations 

income taxes 

deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis this evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

we account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

recent accounting pronouncements 

disclosure of the effects of reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 201302 which required that the effects of significant reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income be shown parenthetically on the face of the consolidated financial statements or disclosed in a note the adoption of this new guidance on january 1 2013 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

subsequent events

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks 

our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates the interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility and our senior secured term loan facility are floating and therefore are subject to fluctuations in order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility we have entered into interest rate derivative agreements to economically hedge a portion of the cash flows associated with the facility our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

w e utilize interest rate caps for the purpose of limiting current and future exposure to interest rate risk on our floatingrate debt under the senior secured term loan facility 

we have interest rate cap agreements in effect through january 14 2015 with a combined notional amount of 11500 million  these cap agreements have not been designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk for gaap accounting purposes of the total 11500 million  notional amount 5000 million  entitle us to payments from the counterparty of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 35  during the agreement period the remaining cap agreements with a notional amount of 6500 million  entitle us to payments from the counterparty of the amount if any by which the threemonth libor exceeds 15  during the agreement period

cdw was founded in 1984 in 2003 we purchased selected us assets and the canadian operations of micro warehouse which extended our growth platform into canada in 2006 we acquired berbee information networks corporation a regional provider of technology products solutions and customized engineering services in advanced technologies primarily across cisco ibm and microsoft portfolios this acquisition increased our capabilities in customized engineering services and managed services 

on october 12 2007 cdw corporation an illinois corporation was acquired through a merger transaction by an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with madison dearborn partners llc and providence equity partners llc the “acquisition” cdw corporation continued as the surviving corporation and same legal entity after the acquisition but became a wholly owned subsidiary of vh holdings inc a delaware corporation 

on december 31 2009 cdw corporation merged into cdwc llc an illinois limited liability company owned by vh holdings inc with cdwc llc as the surviving entity this change had no impact on our operations or management on december 31 2009 cdwc llc was renamed cdw llc “cdw llc” on august 17 2010 vh holdings inc was renamed cdw corporation “parent” a delaware corporation

 our customers 

we provide integrated it solutions to more than 250000 small medium and large business government education and healthcare customers throughout the us and canada sales to the us federal government which are diversified across multiple agencies and departments collectively accounted for approximately 10 of our 2012 net sales excluding these sales to the federal government we are not reliant on any one customer as our next five largest customers cumulatively comprised approximately 2 of our net sales in 2012 

inventory management 

we utilize our it systems to manage our inventory in a costefficient manner resulting in a rapidturn inventory model we generally only stock items that have attained a minimum sales volume

we also have dropshipment arrangements with many of our oems and wholesale distributors which permit us to offer products to our customers without having to take physical delivery at either of our distribution centers

 7 

we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue changing as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for a discussion of the risks associated with competition see “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect our business and the results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some important factors that may cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our business and our ability to incur additional indebtedness could intensify these risks 

we are a highly leveraged company and our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness as of december 31 2012 we had 38 billion of total longterm debt outstanding as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” and 2492 million of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements and we had the ability to borrow an additional 6224 million under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility the “revolving loan” subject to the limits contained in our senior credit facilities and indentures we may be able to incur additional debt from time 

to time including drawing on our revolving loan to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our business associated with our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

 restrictive covenants under our senior credit agreements and indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit agreements and our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

   

upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit agreements or indentures the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these amounts and exercise other remedies if such indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full 

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2012 we had 13395 million of variable rate debt outstanding if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to do so in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective 

risks related to our business 

general economic conditions could negatively affect technology spending by our customers and put downward pressure on prices which may have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

weak economic conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions skepticism about the resolution of us fiscal cliff negotiations and the implementation of resulting agreements concerns about future scheduled budgetary cuts and that the us government may reach its debt ceiling in early 2013 or a prolonged or further tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows for example during the economic downturn at the end of 2008 and in 2009 due to a number of factors including declines in the availability of credit weakening consumer and business confidence and increased unemployment we experienced significantly reduced revenue and gross margins when our customers and potential customers reduced their spending on technology and put downward pressure on prices 

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public segment customers 

our sales to our public segment customers are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels although our sales to the federal government are diversified across multiple agencies and departments they collectively accounted for approximately 10 of 2012 net sales an adverse change in government spending policies including budget cuts at the federal level resulting from sequestration budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products 

we purchase products for resale from vendor partners which include oems and software publishers and wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2012 we purchased approximately 52 of the products we sold directly from vendor partners and the remaining amount from wholesale distributors we are authorized by vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding including purchase rebates sales volume rebates purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows in addition a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows particularly given our substantial indebtedness 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to resellers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2012 products we purchased from distributors ingram micro tech data and synnex represented 12 10 and 9 respectively of our total purchases in addition sales of apple cisco emc hewlettpackard lenovo and microsoft products comprise a substantial portion of our sales representing approximately 56 of net sales in 2012 sales of products manufactured by hewlettpackard and cisco represented approximately 21 and 13 respectively of our 2012 net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other key vendor partners the diminished availability of their products or backlogs for their products leading to manufacturer allocation could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position 

additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows further the sale spinoff or combination of any of our vendor partners andor certain of their business units including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services offerings we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services offerings as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers a decrease in the rate of innovation or the lack of acceptance of innovations by customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware software and services offerings for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels to the extent that a vendors offering that is highly in demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 

   

we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors 

some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to our customers in addition traditional oems are increasing their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers moreover newer potentially disruptive technologies exist and are being developed that deliver technology solutions as a service for example cloud based solutions including software as a service saas infrastructure as a service iaas and platform as a service paas these technologies could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through resellers like us or could lead to a reduction in our profitability if any of these trends becomes more prevalent it could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems including our business systems web servers and voice and data networks the quality and our utilization 

of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

   

the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats including computer viruses and malicious hackers there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business and results of operations 

breaches of data security could impact our business 

our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers and others in addition we operate three customer data centers which may store and transmit both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers in connection with our services business our coworkers also have access to our customers confidential data and other information we have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however breaches in security could expose us our customers or other individuals to a risk of public disclosure loss or misuse of this information resulting in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the failure to comply with our public segment contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things termination fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues from our public segment customers are derived from sales to governmental departments and agencies educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services sales to public segment customers are highly regulated noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including but not limited to the false claims act and the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public segment customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with the government and other customers in the public segment in addition generally contracts in the public segment are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization or upon default the effect of any of these possible actions could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we fail to provide highquality services to our customers or if our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our service offerings include field services managed services warranties configuration services partner services and telecom services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers finally we also offer certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide high quality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers businesses this could among other things result in legal claims and proceedings and liability and our reputation with our customers our brand and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract develop and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business including our key executive management sales services and technical coworkers 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of thomas e richards our chairman and chief executive officer as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers our future success also will depend on our ability to retain our customerfacing coworkers who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with many of our customers in addition as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers for whom the market is extremely competitive 

our inability to attract develop and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and adversely affect our ability to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions moreover our inability to train our sales services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel such consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

a significant portion of the products we sell are manufactured or purchased by our vendor partners outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events that could also cause disruptions to our supply chain include 

   

we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell are purchased or manufactured or may be purchased or manufactured in the future will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargos sanctions safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell as well as foreign labor strikes and work stoppages or boycotts could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business 

substantially all of our corporate warehouse and distribution functions are located at our vernon hills illinois facilities and our second distribution center in north las vegas nevada if the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence we could utilize the other distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate three customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on commercial delivery services 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales typically on 30day payment terms we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty or in the case of public segment customers during periods of budget constraints 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request these bulk purchases could increase our exposure to inventory obsolescence 

we could be exposed to additional risks if we make acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may pursue transactions including acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses any of which could adversely affect our operations 

in addition our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by gaap in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades 

our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial employment tort and other litigation 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services in 

the form of ceaseanddesist letters licensing inquiries lawsuits and other communications and demands in our industry such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased increasingly many of these assertions are brought by nonpracticing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue but we may also be subject to suits from competitors who may seek licensing revenue lost profits andor an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities including selling certain products and services 

because of our significant sales to governmental entities we also are subject to audits by federal state and local authorities we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts 

current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any litigation infringement claim governmental proceeding audit or indemnification claim could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are controlled by the equity sponsors whose interests may differ from our other stakeholders 

substantially all of the common stock of parent is held indirectly by investment funds affiliated with or coinvestment vehicles controlled by the equity sponsors as a result the equity sponsors control us and have the power to elect all of the members of parents board of directors and approve any action requiring the approval of the holders of parents stock including approving acquisitions or sales of all or substantially all of our assets the directors appointed by the equity sponsors have the ability to control decisions affecting our capital structure including the issuance of additional debt and capital stock the declaration of dividends and to appoint new management if we encounter financial difficulties or we are unable to pay our debts as they mature the interests of the equity sponsors might conflict with the interests of our other equity holders debt holders or other stakeholders additionally the equity sponsors are in the business of investing in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the equity sponsors may also separately pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us since our equity securities which are not registered under the securities exchange act of 1934 are not listed on any us securities exchange we are not subject to any of the corporate governance requirements of any us securities exchange

as of december 31 2012 we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters if any has been incurred however the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable as such our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters

dividends 

we did not pay any dividends in 2012 or 2011 

our senior credit agreements and indentures impose restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and thus our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will depend upon among other things our level of indebtedness at the time of the proposed dividend and whether we are in default under any of our debt instruments our future dividend policy will also depend on the requirements of any future financing agreements to which we may be a party and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations cash requirements financial condition business opportunities provision of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant for a discussion of our cash resources and needs see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” included elsewhere in this report

trends and key factors affecting our financial performance 

net sales gross profit and operating income increased 55  54  and 85  respectively in 2012 compared to 2011 our corporate segment grew net sales by 33  and our public segment grew net sales by 71  gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained flat from 2011 at 165  the increase in operating income was driven by sales growth and our continued focus on cost management net income increased 1019 million to 1190 million  in 2012 compared to 171 million  in 2011 

we believe the following trends may have an important impact on our financial performance 

 21 

result in reduced or deferred spending by our customers on information technology products and services and increased competitive pricing pressures 

 key business metrics 

our management monitors a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin ebitda and adjusted ebitda cash and cash equivalents net working capital cash conversion cycle defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios sales per coworker and coworker turnover these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management so that actions can be taken as necessary in order to achieve the standards and objectives adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our senior credit facilities in addition to net sales gross profit operating income and net income discussed above the following are the results of other key measures in 2012 compared to 2011 

 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011 

the following table presents our results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011    



net sales 

the following table presents our net sales by segment in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011  



 

the following table presents our net sales by customer channel for our corporate and public segments and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011  



total net sales in 2012 increased 5258 million  or 55  to 101282 million  compared to 96024 million  in 2011 there were 254  and 255  selling days in the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011  respectively on an average daily basis total net sales increased 59  the increase in total net sales was the result of general volume growth market share gains a more tenured sales force and a continued focus on seller productivity across all areas of the organization our net sales growth for the year ended december 31 2012  reflected growth in notebooksmobile devices netcomm products software products desktop computers and enterprise storage 

corporate segment net sales in 2012 increased 1784 million  or 33  compared to 2011 within our corporate segment net sales to mediumlarge customers increased 38  between years and net sales to small business customers increased 16  between years customers within the corporate segment continued to take a more cautious approach to spending as increased macroeconomic uncertainty impacted decisionmaking and led to some customers delaying purchases the increases in corporate segment net sales were primarily a result of hardware growth most notably in netcomm products and unit volume growth in desktop computers software product growth led by network management and security software also contributed to the increase in net sales partially offsetting the growth was a decline in net sales of memory products due to several large orders in the second and third quarters of 2011 that did not recur 

public segment net sales in 2012 increased 2658 million  or 71  between years driven by continued strong performance in the healthcare customer channel net sales to healthcare customers increased 2206 million  or 181  between years led by hardware growth most notably in enterprise storage and unit volume growth in netcomm products desktop computers and point of care technology carts software product growth also contributed to the increase in net sales in healthcare the healthcare customer channel growth was primarily the result of deeper relationships with several group purchasing organizations and increased healthcare industry demand for it products as the healthcare industry continued its adoption of electronic medical records and point of care technologies net sales to government customers increased 506 million  or 38  in 2012 compared to 2011 led by unit volume increases in sales of notebooksmobile devices partially offset by a decline in net sales of netcomm products net sales to education customers decreased 54 million  or 04  between years reflecting budget constraints a decline in sales to k12 customers was partially offset by growth in sales to higher education customers that was led by increased sales of netcomm products as higher education customers refreshed and added additional enterprise technology 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 861 million  or 54  to 16696 million  in 2012 compared to 15835 million  in 2011 as a percentage of total net sales gross profit was 165  in both 2012 and 2011 gross profit margin was positively impacted 10 basis points by a higher mix of commission and net service contract revenue fully offsetting these increases in gross profit margin were declines in vendor funding primarily due to program changes for certain vendors commission revenue including agency fees earned on sales of software licenses and software assurance under enterprise agreements has a positive impact on our gross profit margin as we record the fee or commission as a component of net sales when earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales net service contract revenue including items such as thirdparty services and warranties also has a positive impact on gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction vendor funding includes purchase discounts volume rebates and cooperative advertising 

the gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix net service contract revenue commission revenue pricing strategies market conditions and other factors any of which could result in changes in gross profit margins 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 394 million  or 40  to 10295 million  in 2012 compared to 9901 million  in 2011 as a percentage of total net sales selling and administrative expenses decreased 10 basis points to 102  in 2012 down from 103  in 2011 the dollar increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs excluding bonus compensation tied to adjusted ebitda of 430 million the higher payroll costs reflected in selling and administrative expenses were driven by increased sales commissions and other variable compensation costs consistent with higher sales and gross profit while total coworker count increased by 59 coworkers from 6745 coworkers at december 31 2011 to 6804 coworkers at december 31 2012 the increase was primarily comprised of service delivery coworkers the cost of which is reflected in cost of sales other factors that increased selling and administrative expenses included a 58 million increase in health benefits due to higher claims costs and a higher average number of participants in 2012 compared to 2011 a 53 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to additional capital expenditures for information technology systems and a 26 million increase in stock compensation expense primarily due to incremental expense related to a modified class b common unit grant agreement with our former chief executive officer partially offsetting these increases was an 118 million decline in bonus compensation tied to adjusted ebitda as performance fell below target 38 million of expenses related to the modification of our senior secured term loan facility in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 and a 33 million decline in litigation expenses between years 

the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales of 10 basis points between years was driven by the decline in incentive compensation tied to adjusted ebitda 

advertising expense 

advertising expense increased 68 million  or 56  to 1295 million  in 2012 compared to 1227 million  in 2011 as a percentage of net sales advertising expense was 13  in both 2012 and 2011 the increase in advertising expense was due to a focus on continuing to advertise our solutions and products and to build our reputation as a leading it solutions provider primarily through targeted digital advertising partially offset by decreases in expenditures for print advertising 

income from operations 

the following table presents income loss from operations by segment in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change in income loss from operations for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011  



  

 not meaningful 

 income from operations was 5106 million  in 2012 an increase of 399 million  or 85  compared to 4707 million  in 2011 this increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses and advertising expense total operating margin percentage increased 10 basis points to 50  in 2012 

compared to 49  in 2011 operating margin percentage was positively impacted by the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 

corporate segment income from operations was 3490 million  in 2012 an increase of 174 million  or 52  compared to 3316 million  in 2011 this increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit margin partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses resulting in a net increase in segment operating income before allocations of 144 million in 2012 compared to 2011 in addition corporate segment income from operations benefited from an increase of 25 million in income allocations from our logistics operations and a decrease of 05 million in headquarters expense allocations in 2012 compared to 2011 the improved profitability of our logistics operations was driven by stronger operating leverage given higher purchase volumes while support costs remained flat 

public segment income from operations was 2467 million  in 2012 an increase of 134 million  or 57  compared to 2333 million  in 2011 this increase reflected higher segment operating income before allocations of 40 million as a result of increased net sales and gross profit dollars partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs in addition public segment income from operations benefited from an increase of 57 million in income allocations from our logistics operations and a decrease in headquarters’ expense allocations of 37 million in 2012 compared to 2011 

interest expense net 

at december 31 2012  our outstanding longterm debt totaled 37710 million compared to 40660 million at december 31 2011 net interest expense in 2012 was 3074 million  a decrease of 168 million  compared to 3242 million  in 2011 interest expense in 2011 included a benefit of 194 million due to an adjustment to the longterm accrued interest liability associated with the extinguishment of 10780 million of senior notes due 2015 the longterm accrued interest liability represents the difference between interest expense previously recognized under the effective interest method and actual interest paid of the remaining net decrease of 362 million 272 million was due to lower effective interest rates and lower debt balances in 2012 compared to the prior year as a result of debt repayment and refinancing activities completed during 2011 and 2012 the remaining net decrease was primarily attributable to additional interest expense in 2011 related to the interest rate swaps that terminated in january 2011 higher 2011 marktomarket losses on interest rate caps higher amortization of deferred financing costs in 2011 compared to 2012 and a 2012 benefit related to an adjustment to the longterm accrued interest liability associated with the extinguishment of 1000 million of senior subordinated notes due 2017 

net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt 

during 2012 we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt of 172 million  compared to 1189 million in 2011 

in february and march 2012 we purchased or redeemed the remaining 1290 million of senior notes due 2015 funded with the issuance of an additional 1300 million of senior notes due 2019 as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 94 million representing the difference between the purchase or redemption price of the senior notes due 2015 and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs 

in december 2012 we redeemed 1000 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due 2017 for 1063 million we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 78 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in march 2011 we amended our senior secured term loan facility and recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 32 million representing a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs on this facility 

in april and may 2011 we purchased 10780 million of senior notes due 2015 funded with the issuance of 11750 million of senior notes due 2019 as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 1141 million representing the difference between the purchase price of the senior notes due 2015 at 109 of principal amount and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in june 2011 we entered into a new 9000 million senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility replacing the existing 8000 million facility as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 16 million representing a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the previous facility 

income tax expense 

income tax expense was 671 million  in 2012 compared to 112 million  in 2011 the effective income tax rate was 360  and 397  for 2012 and 2011 respectively 

for 2012 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable adjustments to state tax credits which are partially offset by the unfavorable impact of adjustments to deferred taxes due to changes in state tax laws and permanent differences for 2011 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable impact of permanent differences offset by a benefit for state income taxes the lower effective tax rate for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily driven by the impact of favorable adjustments to state tax credits in 2012 and the lower rate impact of permanent differences in 2012 due to the significantly greater amount of pretax income 

net income 

net income was 1190 million  in 2012 compared to 171 million  in 2011 the 2012 and 2011 results included after tax losses on extinguishments of longterm debt of 105 million and 725 million respectively other significant factors and events causing the net changes from 2011 to 2012 are discussed above 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 7666 million  in 2012 an increase of 493 million  or 69  compared to 7173 million  in 2011 as a percentage of net sales adjusted ebitda was 76  and 75  in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2012 and 2011 in the table below ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements see “selected financial data” included elsewhere in this report for a reconciliation of ebitda to cash flows from operating activities

corporate segment net sales in 2011 increased 5008 million or 104 compared to 2010 within our corporate segment net sales to medium  large customers increased 109 between years and net sales to small business customers increased 84 between years these increases were primarily a result of hardware unit volume growth most notably in notebookmobile devices and netcomm products and growth in software products as we continued to benefit from increased demand from our corporate customers public segment net sales in 2011 increased 1966 million or 55 between years as growth in the healthcare customer channel more than offset slight declines in the government and education customer channels net sales to healthcare customers increased 2246 million or 227 between years primarily driven by hardware unit volume increases in desktop computers notebookmobile devices and netcomm products growth in software products and additional sales from an expanded relationship with a group purchasing organization net sales to government customers decreased 251 million or 18 in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by a 102 decline between years for the first nine months of 2011 partially offset by net sales growth of 228 between years for the fourth quarter of 2011 although government spending was impacted negatively throughout 2011 as a result of budget constraints and uncertainty net sales to federal government customers drove the fourth quarter increase of 228 in the government customer channel the fourth quarter of 2011 benefited from increased orders placed late in the third quarter the end of the federal governments fiscal year that shipped during the fourth quarter compared to the same period of the prior year net sales to education customers decreased 29 million or 02 between years due to continuing budget pressures

gross profit increased 1927 million or 139 to 15835 million in 2011 compared to 13908 million in 2010 as a percentage of total net sales gross profit was 165 in 2011 up from 158 in 2010 gross profit margin increased 70 basis points between years primarily due to favorable pricemix changes within product margin across most product categories of 30 basis points and a higher mix of commission and net service contract revenue of 20 basis points commission revenue including agency fees earned on sales of software licenses and software assurance under enterprise agreements has a positive impact on our gross profit margin as we record the fee or commission as a component of net sales when earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount net service contract revenue including items such as thirdparty services and warranties also has a positive impact on gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 

the gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix net service contract revenue commission revenue pricing strategies market conditions and other factors any of which could result in changes in gross profit margins 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 580 million or 62 to 9901 million in 2011 compared to 9321 million in 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll costs of 621 million driven by increased sales commissions and other variable compensation costs consistent with higher sales and gross profit and an increase in the number of coworkers in 2011 our sales force increased to 3636 coworkers at december 31 2011 compared to 3405 coworkers at december 31 2010 while total coworker count increased to 6745 coworkers at december 31 2011 compared to 6268 coworkers at december 31 2010   we also had increases in profit sharing401k expense of 49 million travel and entertainment expense of 37 million and bad debt expense of 27 million these increases were partially offset by lower consulting and debtrelated professional fees of 100 million lower depreciation and amortization expense of 42 million lower healthcare benefits expense of 36 million and lower sales and use tax expense of 33 million 

advertising expense 

advertising expense increased 167 million or 157 to 1227 million in 2011 compared to 1060 million in 2010 higher expenses were due to increased spending on webbased advertising tv advertising and customerfocused marketing events as a percentage of net sales advertising expense was 13 in 2011 compared to 12 in 2010 

income from operations 

the following table presents income loss from operations by segment in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change in income loss from operations for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 



  

 income from operations was 4707 million in 2011 an increase of 1180 million or 335 compared to 3527 million in 2010 this increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit partially offset by higher advertising expense and selling and administrative expenses 

corporate segment income from operations was 3316 million in 2011 an increase of 754 million or 294 compared to 2562 million in 2010 the increase in corporate segment income from operations was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit margin partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs resulting in a net increase before allocations of 496 million in 2011 compared to 2010 in addition corporate segment income from operations benefited from an increase of 283 million in income allocations from our logistics operations in 2011 compared to 2010 the improved profitability of our logistics operations was driven by stronger operating leverage given higher purchase volumes while support structure costs remained flat partially offsetting the above items was an increase in headquarters expense allocations to the corporate segment of 25 million 

public segment income from operations was 2333 million in 2011 an increase of 403 million or 209 compared to 1930 million in 2010 the increase reflected higher operating income before allocations of 259 million as a result of higher net sales and gross profit margin partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs in addition public segment income from operations benefited from an increase of 151 million in income allocations from our logistics operations in 2011 compared to 2010 

the loss from operations for our headquarters function of 1117 million in 2011 was flat compared to the loss from operations of 1108 million in 2010 

interest expense net 

at december 31 2011 our outstanding longterm debt totaled 40660 million compared to 42891 million at december 31 2010 net interest expense in 2011 was 3242 million a decrease of 677 million compared to 3919 million in 2010 interest expense was reduced by 194 million in 2011 due to a decrease in the longterm accrued interest liability associated with the extinguishment of 10780 million of senior notes due 2015 the longterm accrued interest liability represents the difference between interest expense previously recognized under the effective interest method and actual interest paid the remaining decrease of 483 million was primarily due to lower effective interest rates in 2011 resulting from the termination of our interest rate swaps in january 2011 and the debt refinancing activities completed during the first half of 2011 partially offset by noncash gains on hedge ineffectiveness recorded to interest expense in the prior year 

net loss gain on extinguishments of longterm debt 

during 2011 we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt of 1189 million compared to a net gain on extinguishments of longterm debt of 20 million in 2010 

in march 2011 we amended our senior secured term loan facility and recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 32 million representing a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs on this facility 

in april and may 2011 we purchased 10780 million of senior notes due 2015 funded with the issuance of 11750 million of senior notes due 2019 as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 1141 million representing the difference between the purchase price of the senior notes due 2015 at 109 of par value and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in june 2011 we entered into a new 9000 million senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility replacing the existing 8000 million facility as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 16 million representing a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the previous facility 

during 2010 we recorded a net gain of 20 million on the extinguishments of longterm debt resulting from two transactions in march 2010 we repurchased 285 million of principal amount of senior subordinated notes due 2017 for a purchase price of 186 million we recorded a gain of 92 million representing the difference between the purchase price including expenses paid to the debt holders and agent and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs the 285 million in principal amount of senior subordinated notes due 2017 that was repurchased was exchanged for increasing rate notes and subsequently surrendered to the indenture trustee for cancellation in december 2010 we extinguished 5000 million of the outstanding principal balance of our senior secured term loan facility funded by proceeds from the issuance of 80 senior secured notes due 2018 we recorded a loss of 72 million on the extinguishment of the senior secured term loan facility representing a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs there was no additional gain or loss resulting from the paydown of the debt balance as the cash paid equaled the principal amount of the debt extinguished 

income tax expense benefit 

the effective income tax rate was 397 and 211 for 2011 and 2010 respectively 

for 2011 the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable impact of permanent differences relative to pretax income the effective tax rate for 2010 reflects the unfavorable impact of permanent differences relative to a small pretax loss 

net income loss 

net income was 171 million in 2011 compared to a net loss of 292 million in 2010 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 7173 million in 2011 an increase of 1154 million or 192 compared to 6018 million in 2010 as a percentage of net sales adjusted ebitda was 75 and 68 in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2011 and 2010 in the table below ebitda is defined as consolidated net income loss before interest expense income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain 

items which are described in the table below both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies even when similar terms are used to identify such measures we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements see “selected financial data” included elsewhere in this report for a reconciliation of ebitda to cash flows from operating activities 

  

 seasonality 

while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year sales in our corporate segment which primarily serves business customers are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year additionally sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we finance our operations and capital expenditures through a combination of internally generated cash from operations and from borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility we believe that our current sources of funds will be sufficient to fund our cash operating requirements for the next year in addition we believe that in spite of the uncertainty of future macroeconomic conditions we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available to meet our longerterm needs however there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities were as follows 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2012 increased 1027 million  compared to 2011 the increase was primarily driven by changes in assets and liabilities resulting in a 1489 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities between periods despite a 2012 fourth quarter increase in net sales of 49 between years accounts receivable remained relatively flat from the prior year end driven by improved collection results particularly within the public segment accounts receivable in 2011 represented a use of cash of 1653 million primarily due to a 2011 fourth quarter increase in net sales of 93 from the same period in the prior year merchandise inventory also contributed 361 million of the increase in cash between years driven by a return to more normalized inventory levels in 2012 following the buildup at the end of 2011 related to the hard drive shortage from the thailand floods along with a higher percentage of drop shipments from vendor partners and distributors in 2012 compared to 2011 partially offsetting these factors in 2012 was a 541 million decrease in other assets as we collected 533 million in income tax refunds in 2011 that did not repeat in 2012 net income adjusted for the impact of noncash items such as losses on extinguishment of longterm debt was 3268 million in 2012 compared to 3730 million in 2011 or a decrease of 462 million improved operating performance in 2012 drove higher net income between years but also higher net cash income taxes paid net cash income taxes paid in 2012 were 1232 million compared to a net cash tax refund of 209 million in 2011 in addition to the 533 million in cash tax refunds received in 2011 we also fully utilized our remaining federal net operating tax loss carryforwards during 2011 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 decreased 2090 million compared to 2010 the decrease was primarily driven by the changes in assets and liabilities resulting in a 3236 million reduction in cash between years for 2011 the changes in assets and liabilities excluding cash and cash equivalents reduced cash by 1583 million compared to a cash contribution of 1653 million in 2010 the most significant driver of the cash contribution in 2010 was an increase in accounts payabletrade of 2693 million as we reduced the amount of accelerated payments we made in exchange for early pay discounts at december 31 2010 compared to the prior year accounts payabletrade decreased 198 million in 2011 compared to 2010 resulting in a relatively small reduction in cash cash flow from operating activities was further reduced by 837 million in 2011 compared to 2010 following an increase in accounts receivable between years driven by higher fourth quarter net sales in 2011 during 2011 we collected 533 million in cash tax refunds which reduced other assets between years resulting in an increase in cash flow from operating activities net income adjusting for the impact of noncash items such as losses on extinguishment of longterm debt increased 1146 million between years reflecting our improved operating results in 2011 

in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs we monitor our cash conversion cycle defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory less days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable the following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle 



 the cash conversion cycle decreased to 24 days at december 31 2012 compared to 27 days at december 31 2011 driven by improvements in dso and dio the dso decline was primarily related to improved collections in the public segment the dio decline was primarily related to an increase in the percentage of products delivered to customers via dropshipment in 2012 compared to 2011 which had the effect of increasing cost of sales without a corresponding increase in inventoryrelated working capital 

the cash conversion cycle decreased to 27 days at december 31 2011 compared to 32 days at december 31 2010 driven by a sixday increase in dpo the increase in dpo reflected a higher combined balance of accounts payabletrade and accounts payableinventory financing at december 31 2011 compared to december 31 2010 as purchase volumes increased to support higher net sales and we received more favorable payment terms for payables related to certain vendors the oneday increase in dso primarily reflected our overall sales growth and a higher proportion of government sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2012 decreased 143 million  compared to 2011 this decline was primarily due to a reduction in cash payments between years of 66 million related to interest rate swap agreements as the 66 million paid in 2011 reflected the final payment upon termination of the swap agreements on january 14 2011 capital expenditures were 414 million  for 2012 and 457 million for 2011 primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years during 2012 and 2011 we paid 03 million  and 37 million respectively for new interest rate cap agreements 

net cash used in investing activities in 2011 decreased 694 million compared to 2010 this decline was primarily due to a reduction in cash payments between years of 715 million under our interest rate swap agreements as the 66 million paid in 2011 reflected the final payment upon termination of the swap agreements capital expenditures were 457 million for 2011 and 415 million for 2010 primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years during 2011 and 2010 we paid 37 million and 59 million respectively for new interest rate cap agreements 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased 2426 million  in 2012 compared to 2011 this change was primarily driven by 2011 net inflows from accounts payableinventory financing of 2505 million compared to 2012 outflows of 295 million resulting in a total impact on the change in cash used in financing activities of 2800 million  from accounts payableinventory financing the reduction in cash during 2012 from accounts payableinventory financing was primarily due to the termination of one of our inventory financing agreements in the first quarter of 2012 with amounts owed for subsequent purchases being included in accounts payabletrade on the consolidated balance sheet and classified as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows as discussed below under “inventory financing arrangements” in june 2011 we entered into a new inventory financing agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from a certain vendor inventory purchases from this vendor under the june 2011 inventory financing agreement are included in accounts payableinventory financing and reported as cash flows from financing activities the net impact of our debt transactions resulted in cash outflows of 3106 million  during 2012 and 3465 million  during 2011 as cash 

was used in each period to reduce our total longterm debt each debt transaction is described below under longterm debt and financing arrangements 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 2547 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily driven by higher cash inflows of 2473 million from accounts payableinventory financing as discussed below under “inventory financing arrangements” in june 2011 we entered into a new inventory financing agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from a certain vendor inventory purchases from this vendor under the new agreement are included in accounts payableinventory financing and reported as cash flows from financing activities a combination of the increase in overall purchase volume under inventory financing agreements to support higher net sales in 2011 along with more favorable payment terms under the new inventory financing agreement drove the majority of the increase in cash flows from financing activities during 2011 compared to 2010 the net impact of our debt transactions resulted in cash outflows of 3465 million  during 2011 compared to cash outflows of 3527 million during 2010 as cash was used in each period to reduce our total longterm debt each debt transaction is described below under longterm debt and financing arrangements 

longterm debt and financing arrangements

we have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions as described below these amounts are classified separately as accounts payableinventory financing on the consolidated balance sheets we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due 

the following table presents the amounts included in accounts payableinventory financing 



we maintain a senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility as described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements which incorporates a 4000 million floorplan subfacility to facilitate the purchase of inventory from a certain vendor in connection with the floorplan subfacility we maintain an inventory financing agreement on an unsecured basis with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from this vendor the “revolving loan inventory financing agreement” amounts outstanding under the revolving loan inventory financing agreement are unsecured and noninterest bearing at december 31 2012 and 2011 we reported 2483 million 2407 million respectively for this agreement within accounts payableinventory financing in the consolidated balance sheets

we have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments operating leases and asset retirement obligations the following table presents our estimated future payments under contractual obligations that existed as of december 31 2012 based on undiscounted amounts 



 40 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

commitments and contingencies 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial intellectual property employment tort and other litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state and local authorities by various partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws in such cases certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

as of december 31 2012 we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters if any has been incurred however the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable as such our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers including oems software publishers and wholesale distributors we record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale delivery has occurred andor services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our shipping terms typically specify fob destination at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

revenues from the sales of hardware products or software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales these items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways including i as physical product shipped from our warehouse ii via dropshipment by the vendor or supplier or iii via electronic delivery for software licenses at the time of sale we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience our vendor partners warrant most of the products we sell 

we leverage dropshipment arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs we recognize revenue for dropshipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify fob destination we recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer we set the price of the product charged to the customer we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced and we work closely with our customers to determine their hardware and software specifications these arrangements generally represent approximately 40 to 50 of total net sales including approximately 10 to 15 related to electronic delivery for software licenses 

revenue from professional services is either recognized as incurred for services billed at an hourly rate or recognized using a proportional performance model for services provided at a fixed fee revenue from software as a service 

arrangements infrastructure as a service arrangements and data center services including internet connectivity web hosting server colocation and managed services is recognized over the period service is provided 

we also sell certain products for which we act as an agent products in this category include the sale of thirdparty services warranties software assurance “sa” or thirdparty hosted software as a service and infrastructure as a service arrangements sa is a product that allows customers to upgrade at no additional cost to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the sa is in effect these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale under net sales recognition the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 

our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements “eas” under eas customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year regardless of changes to their employee base customers are charged an annual trueup fee for changes in the number of users over the year with most eas our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount in certain instances we bill the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer 

from time to time we sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of the products and services for each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting revenue is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element as determined by our selling price for the deliverable when it is sold on a standalone basis 

we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a cost of sales 

deferred revenue includes 1 payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services and 2 amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met   

we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales intransit to customers at the end of each period based on a weightedaverage analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes dropshipment arrangements this analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount of sales intransit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been received by the customer changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period 

inventory valuation 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value cost is determined using a weightedaverage cost method price protection is recorded when earned as a reduction to the cost of inventory we decrease the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand specifically known inventoryrelated risks and assumptions about future demand and market conditions if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

vendor programs 

we receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates bid programs price protection and other programs these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory depending on the nature of the incentive vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs which could have an impact on our results of operations 

we record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets if actual performance does not match our estimates we may be required to adjust our receivables we record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors’ inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims however if actual collections differ from our estimates we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments we are required to perform an evaluation of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment the annual test for impairment is conducted as of december 1 we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of a reporting units fair value from the last quantitative assessment or performing a quantitative assessment by comparing a reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying amount under the quantitative assessment testing for impairment of goodwill is a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is considered the most indicative of the reporting units’ fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn under the market approach we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for peer group companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company we have weighted the income approach and the market approach at 75 and 25 respectively 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit and the allocation of that fair value to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the event a step two analysis is required is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include primarily but are not limited to discount rate terminal growth rate selection of appropriate peer group companies and control premium applied and forecasts of revenue growth rates gross margins operating margins and working capital requirements the allocation requires analysis to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including among others customer relationships trade names and property and equipment any changes in the judgments estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results although we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may vary significantly and may expose us to material impairment charges in the future 

intangible assets include customer relationships trade names internally developed software and other intangibles intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software these intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we take into consideration historical loss experience the overall quality of the receivable portfolio and specifically identified customer risks if actual collections of customer receivables differ from our estimates additional allowances may be required which could have an impact on our results of operations 

income taxes 

deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis this evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

we account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

recent accounting pronouncements 

testing goodwill for impairment 

in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201108 which was intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying amount using the qualitative assessment the entity would not be required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test for that reporting unit this update was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

presentation of comprehensive income 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 which amended guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income the new guidance eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders’ equity it required an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements subsequently the fasb issued asu 201112 in december 2011 which deferred changes in asu 201105 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income the guidance did not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income these updates were to be applied retrospectively and were effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 we adopted asu 201105 and asu 201112 as of january 1 2012 as this guidance impacts presentation only the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

fair value measurements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 the new guidance resulted in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” the new guidance did not extend the use of fair value accounting but provided guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within gaap or ifrs this update was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 the adoption of this guidance on january 1 2012 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows     

subsequent events 

on january 30 2013 we made an optional prepayment of 400 million  aggregate principal amount of the term loan the prepayment was allocated on a pro rata basis between the extended and nonextended loans the optional prepayment satisfied the excess cash flow payment provision of the term loan with respect to the year ended december 31 2012 

on february 6 2013 we called for redemption 500 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior subordinated notes the redemption price of the senior subordinated notes was 106268 of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption which was march 8 2013 in connection with this redemption we expect to record a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 39 million in our consolidated statement of operations in the first quarter of 2013 this loss represents the redemption premium and the writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the senior subordinated notes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks 

our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates the interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility and our senior secured term loan facility are floating and therefore are subject to fluctuations in order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility we have entered into interest rate derivative agreements to economically hedge a portion of the cash flows associated with the facility our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

w e utilize interest rate caps for the purpose of limiting current and future exposure to interest rate risk on our floatingrate debt under the  senior secured term loan facility 

in november 2012 the company entered into six interest rate cap agreements with a combined 6500 million notional amount under these agreements the company made premium payments totaling 03 million to the counterparties in exchange for the right to receive payments from them of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 15 during the agreement period the cap agreements are effective from january 14 2013 through january 14 2015 

during 2011 the company entered into four interest rate cap agreements with a combined 5000 million notional amount under the agreements the company made premium payments totaling 37 million to the counterparties in exchange for the right to receive payments from them of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 35 during the agreement period the cap agreements are effective from january 14 2013 through january 14 2015 

in april 2010 the company entered into four interest rate cap agreements with a combined 11000 million notional amount under these agreements the company made premium payments totaling 59 million to the counterparties in exchange for the right to receive payments from them of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 35 during the agreement period the cap agreements are effective from january 14 2011 through january 14 2013 

these interest rate cap agreements have not been designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk for accounting purposes instead these agreements are recorded at fair value on the companys consolidated balance sheet each period with changes in fair value recorded directly to interest expense net in the companys consolidated statements of operations each period

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

introduction 

this compensation discussion and analysis provides an overview of the companys executive compensation philosophy and the material elements of compensation earned by our named executive officers with respect to 2012 

our named executive officers consist of our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three other most highly compensated executive officers named executive officers for 2012 the named executive officers were 

 on october 12 2007 we were acquired by a company controlled by investment funds affiliated with the equity sponsors the “acquisition” since the acquisition a compensation committee comprised of members appointed by the equity sponsors has had responsibility for determining the compensation of our named executive officers for purposes of this compensation discussion and analysis the compensation committee is referred to as the “committee” 

establishing and evaluating executive compensation 

executive compensation philosophy and objectives 

the committee believes that the companys executive compensation program should reward actions and behaviors that drive longterm profitable revenue growth and the creation of sustainable shareholder value the committee seeks to foster these objectives through a compensation system that focuses heavily on variable performancebased incentives that create a balanced focus on the companys shortterm and longterm strategic and financial goals the following objectives are grounded in a payforperformance philosophy and provide a framework for the companys executive compensation program 

 103 

 consistent with the companys payforperformance philosophy and executive compensation program objectives adjustments to executive compensation levels have historically been based on individual and company performance with reference to the compensation levels paid to similarly situated executive officers at the company as well as market data to provide a perspective on external practices 

market comparisons 

the committee considers relevant market pay practices when establishing and evaluating executive compensation in conjunction with market data the committee also considers the executives overall responsibilities individual performance against company goals and leadership impact when establishing appropriate compensation levels 

to obtain a broad view of competitive practices among industry peers and competitors for executive talent the committee reviews market data for peer group companies as well as general industry and technology company surveys each of the companies in the companys 2012 peer group met one or more of the following criteria i operated in the same line of business as the company ii operated “close” to the companys line of business iii operated in a businesstobusiness distribution environment or iv competed with the company for talent the 2012 peer group consisted of the following companies which were the same companies that were used to evaluate 2011 compensation 

     

aon hewitt provides competitive data for the peer group utilizing peer group proxy data and its general industry database for the ceo and cfo for the senior vice president chief marketing officer and senior vice president corporate sales for which sufficient peer group data was not available aon hewitt provided revenue sizeadjusted competitive data from its general industry database 

in reviewing the compensation levels set for each named executive officer the committee supplements the aon hewitt peer group data with data taken from technology industry surveys prepared by radford a leading provider of compensation market data while the radford surveys include information regarding over 1000 companies the committees use of the surveys was limited to a review of us compensation data derived from technology companies in the surveys that had annual revenues in excess of 30 billion the committee also reviewed depending on the availability of data within the radford surveys for the position being considered market data derived from between 16 and 31 of the technology companies included in the surveys which companies had median annual revenues of between 52 billion and 92 billion in reviewing the sizeadjusted data from the aon hewitt general industry database and the radford database the committee does not review the specific companies included in the databases 

for mr richards the peer group was the primary market data source for evaluating 2012 base salary and annual cash incentive award opportunity given the availability of chief executive officer compensation data in public filings with the compensation survey data providing a supplemental viewpoint for the other named executive officers other than mr edwardson the committee reviewed blended market data when evaluating the 2012 base salary and annual cash incentive awards with the peer group data and compensation survey data weighted equally the committee did not undertake a 2012 market review of mr edwardsons compensation as his compensation levels were set pursuant to the terms of his 2011 employment agreement for purposes of this compensation discussion and analysis the peer group data and compensation survey data are collectively referred to as “market data” 

in determining mr richards 2012 longterm incentive award the committee took into consideration mr richards successful performance since assuming the position of chief executive officer the fact that mr richards did not receive an additional longterm incentive award at the time he assumed the position of chief executive officer as well as longterm incentive compensation market data compiled by the committees independent compensation consultant frederic w cook  co the “compensation consultant” for purposes of mr richards 2012 longterm incentive award the committee did not view publicly traded peer group longterm incentive grant practices as being relevant at the time given the companys private equity ownership and illiquid stock therefore the compensation consultants study did not focus on the grant date value of longterm incentive awards among peers but rather focused on the potential ownership opportunities  ie  carried interest levels expressed as both a percentage ownership in the company as well as a dollar value for chief executive officers at companies with private equity ownership that recently became publicly listed through an initial public offering the peer group used for this purpose consisted of the following companies 



since the acquisition the company has continued to utilize the peer group established prior to the acquisition as our business model has evolved following the acquisition to that of a multibrand technology solutions provider in 2012 the committee felt it appropriate to perform a holistic review of the companys historical peer group with the assistance of the compensation consultant based on this review the committee approved changes to the companys current peer group selection criteria to include companies that met one or more of the following criteria i similar size in terms of revenue andor enterprise value onethird to three times the companys revenue or enterprise value ii operates in a businesstobusiness distribution environment iii members of the technology industry iv similar customers  ie  business government healthcare and education v companies that provide services andor solutions and vi similar ebitda and gross margins as a result the committee approved the peer group set forth below to be used for 2013 compensation decisions based on data compiled by the compensation consultant at the time of the peer group review our revenues and ebitda were between the median and 75 th  percentile of the revised peer group 



the following companies were deleted from the companys peer group due to differences in size andor differences in business model avaya inc best buy co inc cr bard inc gtsi corp illinois tool works inc ingram micro inc ncr corporation office depot inc officemax incorporated pc connection inc radioshack corporation staples inc and tech data corporation 

independent compensation consultant 

as noted above frederic w cook  co was retained by the committee in 2012 to advise on executive compensation matters the compensation consultant did not provide any additional services to the company in 2012 

role of executive officers 

the committee is responsible for all compensation decisions for our named executive officers mr richards reviewed the performance of each executive officer and based on these reviews made recommendations to the committee with respect to 2012 compensation 

elements of compensation 

the companys 2012 executive compensation program consisted of the following principal elements 

 base salary 

the committee generally sets base salaries for executives including the named executive officers below the market median of salaries for executives in similar positions and with similar responsibilities at companies included in the market data aligned with our compensation philosophy a large proportion of executives total target cash compensation is nonfixed or variable to provide a strong connection between pay and performance accordingly in 2012 the base salaries for mr richards and mr edwardson were 40 of each of their respective total target cash compensation levels and the base salaries for the other named executive officers ranged from 31 to 50 of their total target cash compensation 

for 2012 the committee did not increase the base salary levels from those set for 2011 for the named executive officers in accordance with the terms of mr edwardsons employment agreement mr edwardsons base salary was reduced over the course of 2012 in connection with his eventual retirement from the company for the base salaries paid to the named executive officers during 2012 see the “2012 summary compensation table” and for a description of mr edwardsons base salary see “narrative to summary compensation table and grants of planbased awards table” 

annual cash incentive awards senior management incentive plan 

cdw provides its senior management with shortterm incentive compensation through its annual cash bonus program the senior management incentive plan “smip” shortterm compensation under smip is a significant component of an executives total target cash compensation opportunity in a given year 

the total target cash compensation opportunity for an executive is generally set so that target compensation varies above or below market median rates based on whether the company outperforms or underperforms market growth rate expectations because the named executive officer base salary levels historically have been below the median market rate the committee uses an abovemedian target smip opportunity to bring targeted total cash compensation within the median range for 2012 the committee did not increase the smip target award levels from those set for 2011 for the named executive officers for 2012 mr richards and mr edwardsons smip target awards represented 60 of their respective total target cash compensation levels and the smip target awards for our other named executive officers ranged from 50 to 69 of their respective total target cash compensation 

in establishing annual performance goals under smip the committee undertakes a rigorous review and analysis to establish performance goals that correlate to above market performance as measured by industry surveys and financial information from publicly traded resellers and publicly traded technology distributors andor manufacturers factors considered by the committee in establishing the performance goals include market growth rate expectations and company market share gain expectations as well as assumptions regarding the companys productivity gains and investments 

the committee believed that a combination of adjusted ebitda and market share performance was the most meaningful measure of the companys 2012 performance for its stakeholders because together they take into account not only the companys absolute performance but also performance relative to the market adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the calculation of adjusted ebitda as well as a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income 

for 2012 the committee determined that no smip payments would be provided unless annual adjusted ebitda met or exceeded 2011 actual adjusted ebitda and set the annual adjusted ebitda performance goal at 7818 million which represented a 9 increase over 2011 actual adjusted ebitda consistent with the 2011 smip design the committee also included a market share factor as a mechanism to adjust payments under smip in operation therefore payment of awards under smip for performance during 2012 was guided by three principles 

 106 

the smip payout curve had a payout range from 0 to 200 of each participants target smip award for performance between 917 and 115 of the adjusted ebitda goal with different levels of payout for increased or constantdecreased market share and no payout if the company failed to achieve 2011 actual adjusted ebitda the threshold target and maximum payout opportunities under the smip payout curve are set forth below 

  

 in 2012 the committee determined that the company had achieved 981 of its adjusted ebitda performance goal and after assessing the market share results as described in footnote 2 above determined that the companys market share grew resulting in a payout percentage of 75 of each named executive officers bonus target the table below sets forth the smip payouts to each of the named executive officers based upon 2012 performance 

  

longterm incentive program 

the equity sponsors believe that members of senior management should hold a personally significant interest in the equity of the company to align their interests and the interests of our stakeholders as described below the equity sponsors implemented their management investment philosophy by requiring members of senior management to invest in the company and by establishing a “profitsinterest program” “profitsinterest programs” are common practice in portfolio companies of private equity firms and allow participants to share in increases in the equity value of the company consistent with practices among similarly situated private equity financed companies we typically provide named executive officers with an initial longterm incentive grant upon hire this initial grant is generally expected to cover a multiyear period however executives may be provided an additional longterm incentive grant upon promotion to reward sustained performance or to provide for internal parity among similarly situated executives at the company to further support the companys longterm objectives we also provide restricted debt unit awards which are a deferred compensation vehicle 

a units 

the equity sponsors investment in the company is held in the form of class a common units of cdw holdings “a units” mr richards ms ziegler and each of our current named executive officers who were with the company at the time of the acquisition were required to invest in a units of cdw holdings because a units represent investment of personal funds by the executives they are not subject to a vesting requirement 

b unit program 

the company granted class b common units of cdw holdings “b units” to each of our current named executive officers who was with the company at the time of the acquisition and in connection with the hiring of named executive officers following the acquisition the committee has the authority to grant b units to new members of senior management and additional b units to current members of senior management a units and b units each represent an equity interest in cdw holdings however the b unit grants have what is called a “participation threshold” based on the value assigned to an a 

unit at the time of the b unit grant the b units only share in equity appreciation above the participation threshold this places the b unit grants in a secondary position to the a units in that in any event in which the equity is valued and paid out holders of the b unit grants are paid only if an amount at least equal to the participation threshold has first been allocated to the a units the a units and the b unit grants share equally in valuation amounts if any above the participation threshold 

based on an evaluation of mr richards successful performance since assuming the position of chief executive officer the fact that mr richards did not receive an additional longterm incentive award at the time he assumed the position of chief executive officer and the compensation market data discussed above under “establishing and evaluating executive compensation  market comparisons” in 2012 the committee granted mr richards 10000 b units other than the grant to mr richards the committee did not authorize the grant of any additional b units to any of the other named executive officers in 2012 

for additional information about the b units granted to mr richards in 2012 see the narrative accompanying the “grants of planbased awards table” the table entitled “2012 outstanding equity awards at fiscal yearend” and the “2012 units vested table” below 

rdu plan 

in 2010 the board adopted the restricted debt unit plan the “rdu plan” which was designed to retain key leaders and focus them on driving the longterm success of the company the rdu plan is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan participants in the rdu plan receive restricted debt units “rdus” that entitle the participant to a proportionate share of payments under the rdu plan determined by dividing the number of rdus held by the participant by 28500 which is the total number of rdus available under the rdu plan each rdu represents 1000 of face value of the senior subordinated notes 

the rdus are designed to track two components of the senior subordinated notes a principal component and an interest component however the participants have no rights to the underlying debt the total amount of compensation available under the rdu plan is based on these two components the principal component credits the rdu plan with an amount equal to 285 million face value of the senior subordinated notes the “debt pool” payment of the principal component under the rdu plan will be made to participants on october 12 2017 unless accelerated due to a sale of the company the interest component credits the rdu plan with amounts equal to the interest that would have been earned on the debt pool from march 10 2010 or if later the date of hire or the date of a subsequent rdu grant through maturity october 12 2017 these amounts are paid to participants on the interest payment dates except that amounts for 2010 and 2011 were deferred until 2012 

in 2012 mr campbell and ms corley each received 400 rdus the committee set the size of mr campbell and ms corleys awards at levels to increase the retentive element of each executives compensation package and to bring the number of rdus held by each executive in line with the number of rdus held by similarly situated executive officers of the company in 2012 other than the grants to mr campbell and ms corley the committee did not authorize the grant of any additional rdus to any of the named executive officers 

for additional information regarding the operation of the rdu plan and the rdus granted to the named executive officers see the narrative accompanying the “2012 nonqualified deferred compensation” table and the “2012 potential payments upon termination or change in control” section 

severance benefits 

the companys employment arrangements with each of the named executive officers provide for payments and other benefits in connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment with the company the committee believes that these severance benefits i help secure the continued employment and dedication of the named executive officers ii enhance the companys value to a potential acquirer because the named executive officers have noncompetition nonsolicitation and confidentiality provisions that apply after any termination of employment including after a change in control of the company and iii are important as a recruitment and retention device as many of the companies with which we compete for executive talent have similar agreements in place for their senior management 

additional information regarding the employment arrangements with each of the named executive officers including a quantification of benefits that would have been received by each named executive officer had his or her employment terminated on december 31 2012 is provided under “2012 potential payments upon termination or change in control” 

other benefits 

our named executive officers participate in the companys corporatewide benefit programs our named executive officers are offered benefits that are commensurate with the benefits provided to all fulltime cdw coworkers which includes participation in the companys qualified defined contribution plan consistent with the companys performancebased culture the company does not offer a servicebased defined benefit pension plan or other similar benefits to its coworkers similarly the company does not provide nonqualified retirement programs or perquisites that are often provided at other companies to the named executive officers

history 

cdw was founded in 1984 in 2003 we purchased selected us assets and the canadian operations of micro warehouse which extended our growth platform into canada in 2006 we acquired berbee information networks corporation a provider of technology products solutions and customized engineering services in advanced technologies primarily across cisco ibm and microsoft portfolios this acquisition increased our capabilities in customized engineering services and managed services 

on october 12 2007 cdw corporation an illinois corporation was acquired through a merger transaction by an 

entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with madison dearborn partners llc and providence equity partners llc the “acquisition” cdw corporation continued as the surviving corporation and same legal entity after the acquisition but became a wholly owned subsidiary of vh holdings inc a delaware corporation 

on december 31 2009 cdw corporation merged into cdwc llc an illinois limited liability company owned by vh holdings inc with cdwc llc as the surviving entity this change had no impact on our operations or management on december 31 2009 cdwc llc was renamed cdw llc “cdw llc” on august 17 2010 vh holdings inc was renamed cdw corporation “parent” a delaware corporation 

throughout this report the terms “the company” “cdw” and “successor” refer to parent and its wholly owned subsidiaries subsequent to the acquisition and “predecessor” refers to cdw corporation an illinois corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries prior to the acquisition

industry overview 

according to international data corporation “idc” the overall us technology market generated approximately 601 billion  in sales in 2011 including 216 billion  in hardware sales 158 billion  in software sales and 227 billion  in services sales the channels through which these products and services are delivered are highly fragmented and served by a multitude of participants these participants include original equipment manufacturers “oems” software publishers wholesale distributors and resellers wholesale distributors such as ingram micro inc tech data corporation and synnex corporation act as intermediaries between oems and software publishers on the one hand and resellers on the other hand providing logistics management and supplychain services resellers which include direct marketers valueadded resellers etailers and retailers sell products andor services directly to the enduser customer sourcing products sold to their customers directly from oems and software publishers or from wholesale distributors cdw is a technology solutions provider with both direct marketer and valueadded reseller capabilities 

two key customer groups within our addressable market are the small and medium business market and the public sector market the small and medium business market is highly fragmented and is generally characterized by companies that employ fewer than 1000 employees the public sector market is also fragmented and is generally divided into market verticals each with specialized needs that require an adaptive and flexible sales services and logistics model to meet customer needs we believe that many vendors rely heavily on channel partners like cdw to efficiently serve small and medium business and public sector customers 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following strengths have contributed to our success and enabled us to become an important strategic partner for both our customers and our vendor partners 

significant scale and scope 

we are a leading multibrand technology solutions provider in the us and canada based upon publicly available information we believe that our net sales are significantly larger than any other multibrand direct marketer or valueadded reseller in the us our significant scale and scope create competitive advantages through 

 5 

organization including purchasing operations it sales marketing and other support functions we leverage these advantages through our two modern distribution centers our efficient business processes and constant focus on productivity improvements and our proprietary information systems which has enabled us to provide costefficient service to our customers 

coworker culture 

our steadfast focus on serving customers and investing in coworkers has fostered a strong “get it done” culture at cdw since our founding we have adhered to a core philosophy known as the circle of service which places the customer at the center of all of our actions we have consistently and cost effectively invested in our coworkers by providing broad and deep coworker training supplying resources that contribute to their success and offering them broad career development opportunities this constant focus on customers and coworkers has created a customercentric highly engaged coworker base which ultimately benefits our customers and fosters customer loyalty 

large and knowledgeable direct selling organization 

we have a large and experienced sales force consisting of more than 3600  coworkers including almost 2900  account managers and field account executives we believe our success is due in part to the strength of our account managers’ dedicated relationships with customers that are developed by calling on existing and new customers providing advice on products responding to customer inquiries and developing solutions to our customers’ complex technology needs the deep industry knowledge of our dedicated sales marketing and support resources within each of our customer channels allows us to understand and solve the unique challenges and evolving technology needs of our customers multiple customer surveys administered by independent parties consistently show that customers view cdw as a leader in customer service compared to other multibrand resellers and solution providers 

highly skilled technology specialists and engineers 

our direct selling organization is supported by a team of almost 800  technology specialists and almost 600  service delivery engineers with more than 3400  industryrecognized certifications who bring deep product and solution knowledge and experience to the technology challenges of our customers we believe our technology specialists who work with customers and our direct selling organization to design solutions and provide recommendations in the selection and procurement process are an important resource and differentiator for us as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions 

large and established customer channels 

we have grown our customer channels within the corporate and public segments to sizeable businesses our government education healthcare and small business channels each has net sales that exceed 1 billion our scale allows us to create specialized sales resources across multiple customer markets which enables us to better understand and meet our customers’ evolving it requirements our scale also provides us diversification benefits for instance our public segment which is comprised of our government education and healthcare channels has historically been less correlated to economic cycles as evidenced by its 5 net sales growth in 2009 while overall technology spending declined in the us market according to idc 

strong established vendor partner relationships 

we believe that our strong vendor partner relationships differentiate us from other multibrand technology solutions providers in addition to providing a costeffective route to market for vendor partners we believe that many of our competitive strengths enhance our value proposition to our vendor partners we believe we are an important extension of our vendor partners’ sales and marketing capabilities as we are the largest us reseller for many of our vendor partners including hewlettpackard we have three  vendor partners with whom we have annual 1 billionplus relationships and we have 14  vendor partners with whom we have relationships exceeding 100 million a year as such we are able to provide technology resources and insights to our customers that might otherwise be difficult for them to access independently or through other technology providers our direct selling organization technology specialists and large customer channels allow us to develop intimate knowledge of our customers’ environments and their specific needs frequently vendor partners will select cdw as a partner to develop and grow new customer solutions we are regularly recognized with top awards from our vendor partners in 2011 we were named microsoft’s volume licensing partner of the year and received eight cisco partner of the year awards 

our business strategies 

our goal is to continue to strengthen our position as a leading multibrand national provider of technology products and solutions by growing our revenues and driving profitability we plan to achieve this objective by capitalizing on our competitive strengths and pursuing the following strategies 

focus on customer requirements and market segmentation 

we have grown our revenues faster than the market which we attribute in large part to our focus on customer requirements and market segmentation we believe our customer intimacy enables us to better understand our customers’ needs and to better identify profitable growth opportunities we intend to maintain this focus with a goal of continuing to outpace our competitors in revenue growth in the markets we serve through increased “share of wallet” from existing customers sales to new customers and expanded it services offerings to both new and existing customers we believe our efforts in these areas will be augmented as we improve our sales coverage and further segment our customer base further leverage our knowledge of our customers’ environments and continue to help our customers adopt proven technologies that meet their needs and make the most of their it investments 

leverage our superior sales and marketing model 

we intend to continue to leverage our large highly productive sales and marketing organization to serve existing customer requirements effectively target new customer prospects improve our product and solutions offerings maximize sales resource coverage strategically deploy internal sales teams technology specialists and field sales account executives and strengthen vendor partner relationships all with the end goal of creating profitable sales opportunities some of the initiatives we have implemented within the last few years including our realignment of our medium and large corporate account managers into geographic regions our addition of selling resources to our healthcare customer channel and our addition of more technology specialists to facilitate sales of newer and more complex technology solutions have contributed to an increase in our annualized net sales per coworker from 1364 million for the quarter ended december 31 2007 to 1476 million  for the quarter ended december 31 2011 we plan to continue to identify and pursue opportunities that further enhance productivity recently we have added sales operations supervisors to handle administrative tasks for our direct sales force coworkers which we believe will further enhance their productivity and we have continued to align our compensation programs to drive profitable revenue growth 

meet our customers’ changing needs through expanded service offerings and solutions 

we intend to continue to expand the range of technology solutions we offer to continue to keep pace with the technology marketplace as customers increasingly demand more elaborate services and solutions in addition to traditional hardware and software products we believe that expanding the range of technology solutions that we offer will enhance our value proposition to our customers and help us to maximize our revenue and profit growth potential we have added almost 600  technology specialists since mid2004 and almost 500  services delivery engineers since mid2006 cdw currently has almost 800  technology specialists organized around core solutions and aligned with our selling organization cdw is growing its presence in geographic markets across the us with coworkers focused on delivering customized engineering solutions we plan to continue to invest in resources and training for our technology specialists and services delivery coworkers to provide our customers with the expert advice and experience they need to make the most of their technology expenditures 

leverage relationships with leading vendor partners 

we intend to continue to leverage our longstanding relationships with major vendor partners to support the growth and profitability of our business we plan to use our vendor partner relationships to ensure that our sales organization remains wellpositioned and welltrained to market new and emerging technologies to end users as one example we are currently working with several large vendor partners to assist them in the sales of cloud computing solutions to the small and medium business marketplace we believe our strong vendor partner relationships will also provide collaborative opportunities for our sales organization and vendor field sales representatives to identify and fulfill additional customer requirements creating increased sales to both new and existing customers in addition we plan to leverage our significant scale to maximize the benefits from volume discounts purchase or sales rebates vendor incentive programs and marketing development funds

inventory managementdistribution 

we utilize our information technology systems to manage our inventory in a costefficient manner resulting in a rapidturn inventory model we generally only stock items that have attained a minimum sales volume 

our distribution process is highly automated once a customer order is received and credit approved orders are automatically routed to one of our distribution centers for picking and shipping as well as configuration and imaging services we operate two distribution centers an approximately 450000 square foot facility in vernon hills illinois and an approximately 513000 square foot facility in north las vegas nevada we ship over 35 million  units annually on an aggregate basis from our two distribution centers we believe that the location of our distribution centers allows us to efficiently ship products throughout the us and provide timely access to our principal distributors our locations enable us to obtain and ship nonstocked items quickly and efficiently we believe that competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of the product categories we offer we continue to improve the productivity of our distribution centers as measured by key performance indicators such as units shipped per hour worked and bin accuracy

 we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors for a discussion of the risks associated with competition see “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect our business and the results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some important factors that may cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 

  risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our business and our ability to incur additional indebtedness could intensify these risks 

we are a highly leveraged company and our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness as of december 31 2011 we had 41 billion of total longterm debt outstanding as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” and 2787 million of obligations outstanding under our trade financing agreements and we had the ability to borrow an additional 6793 million under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility the “revolving loan” subject to the limits contained in our senior credit facilities and indentures we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time including drawing on our revolving loan to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our business associated with our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

 restrictive covenants under our senior credit agreements and indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit agreements and our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 11 

 upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit agreements or indentures the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these amounts and exercise other remedies if such indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full 

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2011 we had 15405 million of variable rate debt outstanding if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to do so in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective 

risks related to our business 

general economic conditions could negatively affect technology spending by our customers and put downward pressure on prices which may have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

weak economic conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions or a prolonged or further tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows for example during the economic downturn at the end of 2008 and in 2009 due to a number of factors including declines in the availability of credit weakening consumer and business confidence and increased unemployment we experienced significantly reduced revenue and gross margins when our customers and potential customers reduced their spending on technology and put downward pressure on prices 

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public segment customers 

our sales to our public segment customers are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels although our sales to the federal government are diversified across multiple agencies and departments they collectively accounted for approximately 10 of 2011 net sales an adverse change in government spending policies budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products 

we purchase products for resale from vendor partners which include oems and software publishers and wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2011 we purchased approximately 52 of the products we sold directly from vendor partners and the remaining amount from wholesale distributors we are authorized by vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding including purchase rebates sales volume rebates purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows in addition a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to resellers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2011 products we purchased from distributors ingram micro tech data and synnex represented 11 10 and 9 respectively of our total purchases in addition sales of apple 

cisco hewlettpackard lenovo and microsoft products comprise a substantial portion of our sales representing approximately 53 of net sales in 2011 sales of products manufactured by hewlettpackard represented approximately 24 of our 2011 net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other key vendor partners the diminished availability of their products or backlogs for their products leading to manufacturer allocation could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position 

additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows further the sale spinoff or combination of any of our vendor partners andor certain of their business units including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services offerings we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services offerings as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers a decrease in the rate of innovation or the lack of acceptance of innovations by customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware software and services offerings for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels to the extent that a vendors offering that is highly in demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 

 we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors 

some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to our customers in addition traditional oems are increasing their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers moreover newer potentially disruptive technologies exist and are being developed that deliver technology solutions as a service for example software as a service saas and hardware as a service haas these technologies could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through resellers like us or could lead to a reduction in our profitability if any of these trends becomes more prevalent it could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems including our business systems web servers and voice and data networks the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

 the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats including computer viruses and malicious hackers there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business and results of operations 

breaches of data security could impact our business 

our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers and others in addition we operate three customer data centers which may store and transmit both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers in connection with our services business our coworkers also have access to our customers confidential data and other information we have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however breaches in security could expose us our customers or other individuals to a risk of public disclosure loss or misuse of this information resulting in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the failure to comply with our public segment contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues from our public segment customers are derived from sales to governmental departments and agencies educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales sales to public segment customers are highly regulated noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including but not limited to the false claims act and the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public segment customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with the government and other customers in the public segment in addition generally contracts in the public segment are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization or upon default the effect of any of these possible actions could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we fail to provide highquality services to our customers or if our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our service offerings include field services managed services warranties configuration services and partner services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers finally we also offer certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide high quality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers businesses our reputation with our customers and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract develop and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business including our key executive management sales services and technical coworkers 

our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of thomas e richards our newly appointed chief executive officer effective october 1 2011 as well as the continued service and support of john a edwardson our retired chief executive officer who is expected to remain as chairman of our board through 2012 and our other executive officers our future success also will depend on our ability to retain our customerfacing coworkers who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with many of our customers in addition as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers for whom the market is extremely competitive 

our inability to attract develop and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and adversely affect our ability to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions moreover our inability to train our sales services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel such consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

a significant portion of the products we sell are manufactured or purchased by our vendor partners outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events that could also cause disruptions to our supply chain include 

 we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell are purchased or manufactured or may be purchased or manufactured in the future will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargos sanctions safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell as well as foreign labor strikes and work stoppages or boycotts could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business 

substantially all of our corporate warehouse and distribution functions are located at our vernon hills illinois facilities and our second distribution center in north las vegas nevada if the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of 

our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence we could utilize the other distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate three customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on commercial delivery services 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales typically on 30day payment terms we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or in the case of public segment customers during periods of budget constraints 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also periodically take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand these bulk purchases could increase our exposure to inventory obsolescence 

we could be exposed to additional risks if we make acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may pursue transactions including acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses any of which could adversely affect our operations 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades 

our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which include commercial employment tort and other litigation 

we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of business either because of the over 100000 products we sell or the business systems we use to sell such products in the form of ceaseanddesist letters licensing inquiries lawsuits and other communications and demands in our industry such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased increasingly many of these assertions are brought by nonpracticing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue 

because of our significant sales to governmental entities we also are subject to audits by federal state and local authorities we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers including government agencies relating to purchases and sales under various contracts in addition we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts 

current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition current and future litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation infringement claims governmental proceedings audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any litigation infringement claim governmental proceeding audit or indemnification claim could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are controlled by the equity sponsors whose interests may differ from our other stakeholders 

substantially all of the common stock of parent is held indirectly by investment funds affiliated with or coinvestment vehicles controlled by the equity sponsors as a result the equity sponsors control us and have the power to elect all of the members of parents board of directors and approve any action requiring the approval of the holders of parents stock including approving acquisitions or sales of all or substantially all of our assets the directors appointed by the equity sponsors have the ability to control decisions affecting our capital structure including the issuance of additional debt and capital stock the declaration of dividends and to appoint new management if we encounter financial difficulties or we are unable to pay our debts as they mature the interests of the equity sponsors might conflict with the interests of our other equity holders debt holders or other stakeholders additionally the equity sponsors are in the business of investing in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the equity sponsors may also separately pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us since our equity securities which are not registered under the securities exchange act of 1934 are not listed on any us securities exchange we are not subject to any of the corporate governance requirements of any us securities exchange

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2011 we owned or leased a total of approximately 21 million  square feet of space throughout the us and canada we own two properties a combined office and an approximately 450000 square foot distribution center in vernon hills illinois and an approximately 513000 square foot distribution center in north las vegas nevada in addition we conduct sales services and administrative activities in various leased locations throughout north america including data centers in madison wisconsin and minneapolis minnesota 

we believe that our facilities are well maintained suitable for our business and occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs as part of our normal business we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business including various pending litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state and local authorities by various customers including government agencies relating to sales under certain contracts and by vendors in addition from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws in such cases certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

as of december 31 2011 we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters if any has been incurred however the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable as such our financial condition and results of operations could be 

adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters

dividends 

we did not pay any dividends in 2011 or 2010 

our senior credit agreements and indentures impose restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and thus our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will depend upon among other things our level of indebtedness at the time of the proposed dividend and whether we are in default under any of our debt instruments our future dividend policy will also depend on the requirements of any future financing agreements to which we may be a party and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our results of operations cash requirements financial condition business opportunities provision of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant for a discussion of our cash resources and needs see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” included elsewhere in this report

overview 

we are a leading multibrand technology solutions provider to business government education and healthcare customers in the us and canada we provide comprehensive and integrated solutions for our customers’ technology needs through our extensive hardware software and valueadded service offerings our breadth of offerings allows our customers to streamline their procurement processes by partnering with us as a complete technology solutions provider our hardware offerings include products with leading brands across multiple categories such as network communications notebooksmobile devices including tablets data storage video monitors printers desktops and servers among others our software offerings include licensing licensing management and software solutions and services that help our customers to optimize their software investments we offer a fullsuite of valueadded services which typically are delivered as part of a technology solution to help our customers meet their specific needs our solutions range from configuration services for computer devices to fullyintegrated solutions such as virtualization collaboration security mobility data center optimization and cloud computing we also offer complementary services including installations sales of warranties and managed services such as remote network and data center monitoring we believe both software and service offerings will be important growth areas for us in the future 

we have two reportable segments corporate which is comprised primarily of business customers and public which is comprised of government entities and education and healthcare institutions our corporate segment is divided into a mediumlarge business customer channel primarily serving customers with more than 100 employees and a small business customer channel primarily serving customers with up to 100 employees we also have two other operating segments cdw advanced services and canada which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and accordingly are combined together as “other” the cdw advanced services business consists primarily of customized engineering services delivered by cdw professional engineers and managed services including hosting and data center services revenues from the sale of hardware software custom configuration and thirdparty provided services are recorded within our corporate and public segments 

our business is welldiversified across customers product and service offerings and vendors from whom we purchase products and software for resale we have aligned our sales and marketing functions around customer channels to retain and increase our sales to existing customers and to acquire new customers we have an experienced and dedicated direct selling organization consisting of account managers who provide inside sales coverage and field account executives who work within an assigned territory and interact with customers in person our direct selling organization is supported by a team of technology specialists who design solutions and provide recommendations in the selection and procurement processes we purchase products for resale from oems and distributors we believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy we are authorized by oems to sell via direct marketing all or selected products offered by the manufacturer we also operate as a reseller for major software publishers that allows the enduser customer to acquire packaged software or licensed products and services our authorization with each oem or software publisher may include one or more of the following product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs such as volume rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements 

we market the cdw brand on a national basis through a variety of public and community relations and corporate communications efforts and through brand advertising that includes the use of print broadcast online social and other media we also market to current and prospective customers through integrated marketing programs that include print and online media events and sponsorships as a result of our relationships with our vendors a substantial portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising reimbursement programs such programs are at the discretion of our vendors and are typically tied to sales or purchasing volumes or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time 

an important factor affecting our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted operating results is the impact of general economic conditions on our customers willingness to spend on information technology during the economic downturn beginning in late 2008 and into 2009 we experienced significantly lower net sales and gross profit as our customers generally 

reduced spending on information technology products and services net sales and gross profit declined 113 and 168 respectively in 2009 compared to 2008 during 2010 we experienced significant increases in net sales gross profit and operating income compared to 2009 partially driven by general growth and higher demand in the information technology industry overall net sales gross profit and operating income increased 229 228 and 12053 respectively in 2010 compared to 2009 during 2011 we continued to experience yearoveryear increases in net sales gross profit and operating income at a more moderate level compared to the higher growth rates we experienced in 2010 net sales gross profit and operating income increased 91  141  and 335  respectively in 2011 compared to 2010 while the us economy did not grow as rapidly in 2011 as it did in 2010 our results benefited from higher demand in the information technology industry overall as well as our focus on growing market share our corporate segment grew net sales by 104  driven by hardware unit volume growth and our public segment grew net sales by 55  driven by 227  growth in the healthcare customer channel government and education net sales declined 18  and 02  respectively primarily due to budget pressures in these customer channels gross profit increased 70 basis points as a percentage of net sales to 165  driven by favorable pricemix changes within product margin and a higher mix of commission and net service contract revenue operating income increased by 335  driven by sales growth gross margin expansion and our continued focus on cost management 

while economic conditions and our recent operating results have generally improved competitive pricing pressures continue in the market downturns in the global economy declines in the availability of credit weakening consumer and business confidence or increased unemployment could result in reduced spending by our customers on information technology products and services and increased competitive pricing pressures our public segment sales are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels although our sales to the federal government are diversified across multiple agencies and departments they collectively accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in 2011 further our sales to state and local governments accounted for approximately 4 of our net sales in 2011 an adverse change in any of these factors could cause our public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows see “risk factorsrisks related to our business” for further discussion 

our management monitors a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin ebitda and adjusted ebitda cash and cash equivalents net working capital cash conversion cycle defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios sales per coworker and coworker turnover these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management so that actions can be taken as necessary in order to achieve the standards and objectives adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our senior credit facilities in addition to net sales gross profit and operating income discussed above the following key measures improved in 2011 compared to 2010 

 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

the following table presents our results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010   



net sales 

the following table presents our net sales by segment in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 



 26 

the following table presents our net sales by customer channel for our corporate and public segments and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 



total net sales in 2011 increased 8012 million  or 91  to 96024 million  compared to 88012 million  in 2010 there were 255  and 254  selling days in the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively on an average daily basis total net sales increased 87  the increase in total net sales was the result of general volume growth and increased demand in the information technology industry overall in addition to our focus on growing market share the most significant drivers of sales growth in 2011 were hardware unit volume growth in notebookmobile devices desktop computers and netcomm products along with growth in software products 

corporate segment net sales in 2011 increased 5008 million  or 104  compared to 2010 within our corporate segment net sales to medium  large customers increased 109  between years and net sales to small business customers increased 84  between years these increases were primarily a result of hardware unit volume growth most notably in notebookmobile devices and netcomm products and growth in software products as we continued to benefit from increased demand from our corporate customers public segment net sales in 2011 increased 1966 million  or 55  between years as growth in the healthcare customer channel more than offset slight declines in the government and education customer channels net sales to healthcare customers increased 2246 million  or 227  between years primarily driven by hardware unit volume increases in desktop computers notebookmobile devices and netcomm products growth in software products and additional sales from an expanded relationship with a group purchasing organization net sales to government customers decreased 251 million  or 18  in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by a 102 decline between years for the first nine months of 2011 partially offset by net sales growth of 228 between years for the fourth quarter of 2011 although government spending was impacted negatively throughout 2011 as a result of budget constraints and uncertainty net sales to federal government customers drove the fourth quarter increase of 228 in the government customer channel the fourth quarter of 2011 benefited from increased orders placed late in the third quarter the end of the federal governments fiscal year that shipped during the fourth quarter compared to the same period of the prior year net sales to education customers decreased 29 million  or 02  between years due to continuing budget pressures 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 1965 million  or 141  to 15874 million  in 2011 compared to 13908 million  in 2010 as a percentage of total net sales gross profit was 165  in 2011 up from 158  in 2010 gross profit margin increased 70 basis points between years primarily due to favorable pricemix changes within product margin across most product categories of 30 basis points and a higher mix of commission and net service contract revenue of 20 basis points commission revenue including agency fees earned on sales of software licenses and software assurance under enterprise agreements has a positive impact on our gross profit margin as we record the fee or commission as a component of net sales when earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount net service contract revenue including items such as thirdparty services and warranties also has a positive impact on gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 

the gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix net service contract revenue commission revenue pricing strategies market conditions and other factors any of which could result in changes in 

gross profit margins 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 619 million  or 66  to 9940 million  in 2011 compared to 9321 million  in 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll costs of 621 million driven by increased sales commissions and other variable compensation costs consistent with higher sales and gross profit and an increase in the number of coworkers in 2011 our sales force increased to 3636 coworkers at december 31 2011 compared to 3405 coworkers at december 31 2010 while total coworker count increased to 6745 coworkers at december 31 2011 compared to 6268 coworkers at december 31 2010    we also had increases in profit sharing401k expense of 49 million travel and entertainment expense of 37 million and bad debt expense of 27 million these increases were partially offset by lower consulting and debtrelated professional fees of 100 million lower depreciation and amortization expense of 42 million lower healthcare benefits expense of 36 million and lower sales and use tax expense of 33 million 

advertising expense 

advertising expense increased 167 million  or 157  to 1227 million  in 2011 compared to 1060 million  in 2010 higher expenses were due to increased spending on webbased advertising tv advertising and customerfocused marketing events as a percentage of net sales advertising expense was 13  in 2011 compared to 12  in 2010 

income loss from operations 

the following table presents income loss from operations by segment in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change in income loss from operations for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 



  

 income from operations was 4707 million  in 2011 an increase of 1180 million  or 335  compared to 3527 million  in 2010 this increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit partially offset by higher advertising expense and selling and administrative expenses 

corporate segment income from operations was 3316 million  in 2011 an increase of 754 million  or 294  compared to 2562 million  in 2010 the increase in corporate segment income from operations was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit margin partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs resulting in a net increase before allocations of 496 million in 2011 compared to 2010 in addition corporate segment income from operations benefited from an increase of 283 million in income allocations from our logistics operations in 2011 compared to 2010 the improved profitability of our logistics operations was driven by stronger operating leverage given higher purchase volumes while support structure costs remained flat partially offsetting the above items was an increase in headquarters expense allocations to the corporate segment of 25 million 

public segment income from operations was 2333 million  in 2011 an increase of 403 million  or 209  compared to 1930 million  in 2010 the increase reflected higher operating income before allocations of 259 million as a result of higher net sales and gross profit margin partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs in addition public segment income from operations benefited from an increase of 151 million in income allocations from our logistics operations in 2011 compared to 2010 

the loss from operations for our headquarters function of 1117 million  in 2011 was flat compared to the loss from operations of 1108 million  in 2010 

interest expense net 

at december 31 2011 our outstanding longterm debt excluding capital leases totaled 40660 million net interest expense in 2011 was 3242 million  a decrease of 677 million  compared to 3919 million  in 2010 interest expense was reduced by 194 million in 2011 due to a decrease in the longterm accrued interest liability associated with the extinguishment of 10780 million of senior notes due 2015 the longterm accrued interest liability represents the difference between interest expense previously recognized under the effective interest method and actual interest paid the remaining decrease of 483 million was primarily due to lower effective interest rates in 2011 resulting from the termination of our interest rate swaps in january 2011 and the debt refinancing activities completed during the first half of 2011 partially offset by noncash gains on hedge ineffectiveness recorded to interest expense in the prior year 

net loss gain on extinguishments of longterm debt 

during 2011 we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of longterm debt of 1189 million  in 2011 compared to a net gain on extinguishments of longterm debt of 20 million in 2010 

in march 2011 we amended our senior secured term loan facility and recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 32 million representing a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs on this facility 

in april and may 2011 we purchased 10780 million of senior notes due 2015 funded with the issuance of 11750 million of senior notes due 2019 as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 1141 million representing the difference between the purchase price of the senior notes due 2015 at 109 of par value and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs 

in june 2011 we entered into a new 9000 million senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility replacing the existing 8000 million facility as a result we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 16 million representing a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the previous facility 

during 2010 we recorded a net gain of 20 million on the extinguishments of longterm debt resulting from two transactions in march 2010 we repurchased 285 million of principal amount of senior subordinated debt for a purchase price of 186 million we recorded a gain of 92 million representing the difference between the purchase price including expenses paid to the debt holders and agent and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs the 285 million in principal amount of senior subordinated debt that was repurchased was exchanged for increasing rate notes and subsequently surrendered to the indenture trustee for cancellation in december 2010 we extinguished 5000 million of the outstanding principal balance of our senior secured term loan facility funded by proceeds from the issuance of 80 senior secured notes due 2018 we recorded a loss of 72 million on the extinguishment of the senior secured term loan facility representing a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs there was no additional gain or loss resulting from the paydown of the debt balance as the cash paid equaled the principal amount of the debt extinguished 

income tax expense benefit 

income tax expense was 112 million  in 2011 compared to an income tax benefit of 78 million  in 2010 the effective income tax rate expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes was 397  in 2011 an effective tax rate of 211  was recognized in 2010 reflecting the impact of permanent items in relation to a relatively small pretax loss 

net income loss 

net income was 171 million  in 2011 compared to a net loss of 292 million  in 2010 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 7173 million  in 2011 an increase of 1154 million  or 192  compared to 6018 million  in 2010 as a percentage of net sales adjusted ebitda was 75 and 68 in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2011 and 2010 in the table below ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical 

measure of a companys performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements see “selected financial data” included elsewhere in this report for a reconciliation of ebitda to cash flows from operating activities 

  

1 other adjustments include certain retention costs and equity investment income

 the following table presents our net sales by customer channel for our corporate and public segments and the dollar and percentage change between periods in net sales for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 



total net sales in 2010 increased 16385 million or 229 to 88012 million compared to 71626 million in 2009 there were 254 selling days in both 2010 and 2009 the increase in total net sales was the result of general growth and increased demand in the information technology industry overall in addition to our focus on growing our market share the most significant driver of sales growth in 2010 was the rebound by our corporate segment which was significantly impacted by the economic downturn in the us that began in late 2008 and continued through 2009 

corporate segment net sales in 2010 increased 10154 million or 266 compared to 2009 within our corporate segment net sales to medium  large customers increased 283 between years while net sales to small business customers increased 203 these increases were driven by hardware unit volume growth most notably in notebookmobile devices and desktop computers as we benefited from increased demand during 2010 from our corporate segment customers who had generally postponed spending on information technology in 2009 as a result of the economic downturn public segment net sales in 2010 increased 5251 million or 173 between years driven by growth across all customer channels within our public segment sales to government customers increased 77 between years but at a lesser rate than other channels as federal sales in 2009 included a relatively high volume of large onetime orders net sales to healthcare customers increased 2671 million or 369 between years driven by volume increases and additional sales resulting from an expanded relationship with a group purchasing organization beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 2580 million or 228 to 13908 million in 2010 compared to 11329 million in 2009 which reflected increased sales across our hardware software and services categories the increase in gross profit dollars was driven primarily by unit growth and favorable pricemix within the hardware sales category consolidated product margin remained relatively flat between years as sustained competitive pressures in the marketplace continued to impact average 

selling prices as a percentage of total net sales gross profit was 158 in both 2010 and 2009 vendor funding including purchase discounts volume rebates and cooperative advertising increased in 2010 but was relatively flat as a percentage of net sales between years gross margin was favorably impacted by higher volume rebates both in terms of dollars and as a percentage of sales largely offset by the impact of lower cooperative advertising income as a percentage of sales following the first quarter of 2010 gross profit margin by quarter improved on a yearoveryear basis as general economic conditions improved 

the gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix net service contract revenue commission revenue pricing strategies market conditions and other factors any of which could result in changes in gross profit margins 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 1110 million or 135 to 9321 million in 2010 compared to 8211 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll costs of 1006 million as a result of higher sales compensation and increases in other variable compensation costs such as incentive bonuses consistent with higher sales and gross profit in addition coworkerrelated costs increased 155 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase of 119 million in profit sharing401k costs while travel and entertainment expense increased 25 million and sales and use tax expense increased 21 million these increases were partially offset by lower depreciation expense of 82 million and lower bad debt expense of 30 million in 2010 compared to 2009 throughout 2010 we continued to cautiously make selective investments in our coworkers as our outlook improved our sales force increased to 3405 coworkers at december 31 2010 compared to 3307 coworkers at december 31 2009 and total coworker count also increased to 6268 coworkers at december 31 2010 compared to 6173 coworkers at december 31 2009 

advertising expense 

advertising expense increased 40 million or 40 to 1060 million in 2010 compared to 1019 million in 2009 increased expenses related to the production of a new advertising campaign ecommerce support and customerfocused marketing events were partially offset by decreased spending in catalog production and circulation as a percentage of net sales advertising expense was 12 in 2010 compared to 14 in 2009 

goodwill impairment 

we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2010 as we performed and passed the annual evaluation of goodwill as of december 1 2010 the goodwill balances at december 31 2010 for our corporate public and other segments were 12230 million 9073 million and 788 million respectively 

we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 2418 million in 2009 continued deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and the overall decline in our net sales during the first half of 2009 indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of certain of our reporting units was reduced to below the respective carrying amount we considered this a triggering event under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and performed an interim evaluation of goodwill as of june 1 2009 as a result of that goodwill impairment evaluation we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2350 million in the second quarter of 2009 this charge was comprised of 2070 million for our corporate segment or 14 of the total goodwill for that segment and 280 million for the cdw advanced services business or 38 of the total goodwill for that operating segment in addition to the goodwill evaluation noted above we recorded 68 million of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2009 for certain trade credits for periods prior to the acquisition which was immediately impaired upon recognition 

income loss from operations 

the following table presents income loss from operations by segment in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change in income loss from operations for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 



  

 income from operations was 3527 million in 2010 an increase of 3846 million compared to a loss from operations of 319 million in 2009 this increase was primarily due to the prior period containing the previously discussed goodwill impairment charge of 2418 million excluding the goodwill impairment charge operating income increased 1429 million or 681 in 2010 compared to 2009 this increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit dollars partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses although we continued to contain our selling and administrative expenses through tight cost control 

corporate segment income from operations was 2562 million in 2010 an increase of 3130 million compared to a loss from operations of 567 million in 2009 the operating loss in 2009 was due to the goodwill impairment charge of 2124 million excluding the goodwill impairment charge corporate segment income from operations increased 1006 million or 646 between years the most significant driver of our corporate segment’s increase in operating income between years was the rebound in net sales which increased 266 in 2010 compared to 2009 following the economic downturn the combination of the increased net sales and the associated gross profit dollars along with continued control of selling and administrative costs increased operating income by 608 million selling and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of net sales in 2010 compared to 2009 despite the increased investment in coworkers discussed above in addition our corporate segment income from operations benefited in 2010 from an increase of 460 million in income allocations from our logistics operations compared to 2009 the improved profitability of our logistics operations was driven by increased operating leverage given higher purchase volumes in 2010 while support structure costs decreased between years partially offsetting the above items was an increase in headquarters’ allocations of 62 million 

public segment income from operations was 1930 million in 2010 an increase of 423 million or 280 compared to 1507 million in 2009 this increase reflected higher operating income of 204 million as a result of higher net sales and gross profit dollars while continuing to control selling and administrative costs selling and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of net sales in 2010 compared to 2009 despite the increased investment in coworkers discussed above in addition our public segment income from operations benefited in 2010 from an increase of 289 million in income allocations from our logistics operations compared to 2009 partially offsetting the above items was an increase in headquarters’ 

allocations of 70 million 

the income from operations within our other segment was 143 million in 2010 compared to a loss from operations of 232 million in 2009 the operating loss for 2009 was a result of the goodwill impairment charge of 283 million for the cdw advanced services business 

the loss from operations for our headquarters’ function of 1108 million was 81 million higher than the loss of 1027 million in 2009 the incremental loss of 81 million in 2010 reflected an increase in costs of 230 million partially offset by higher intercompany allocations to the operating segments of 149 million the 230 million cost increase in 2010 was driven by additional investments in coworkers primarily related to incentive compensation and profit sharing401k 

interest expense net 

at december 31 2010 our outstanding longterm debt excluding capital leases totaled 42891 million net interest expense was 3919 million in 2010 compared to 4317 million in 2009 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the yearoveryear change in the net noncash impact of hedge ineffectiveness recorded in interest expense on the interest rate swap agreements which resulted in a gain of 258 million in 2010 compared to a loss of 287 million in 2009 also contributing to the decrease were lower average outstanding debt balances during 2010 compared to 2009 partially offsetting these items was a higher interest rate on the senior secured term loan facility as a result of a november 2009 amendment to this facility and increased expense due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements 

net gain on extinguishments of longterm debt 

we recorded a net gain of 20 million on the extinguishment of longterm debt resulting from two transactions during 2010 

in march 2010 we repurchased 285 million of principal amount of the outstanding senior subordinated debt for a purchase price of 186 million we recorded a gain of 92 million on the extinguishment of this debt in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2010 the gain represents the difference between the purchase price including expenses paid to the debt holders and agent and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs the 285 million in principal amount of debt was exchanged for increasing rate notes and subsequently surrendered to the indenture trustee for cancellation 

in december 2010 we extinguished 5000 million of the outstanding principal balance of our senior secured term loan facility funded by proceeds from the issuance of 80 senior secured notes due 2018 we recorded a loss of 72 million on the extinguishment of this debt in our consolidated statement of operations during the fourth quarter of 2010 this loss represents a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs on the senior secured term loan facility there was no additional gain or loss resulting from the paydown of the debt balance as the cash paid equaled the principal amount of the debt extinguished 

income tax benefit 

the income tax benefit was 78 million in 2010 compared to 878 million in 2009 the effective income tax rate expressed by calculating the income tax benefit as a percentage of loss before income taxes was 211 in 2010 compared to 190 in 2009 the change in the effective rate from 2009 to 2010 was due to the nondeductible goodwill charge in 2009 and a relatively higher impact on the effective tax rate of permanent items in 2010 due to the relatively small pretax loss in addition state taxes in 2010 were higher due to changes in state rates and apportionment 

net loss 

the net loss was 292 million in 2010 compared to a net loss of 3734 million in 2009 the yearoveryear change was primarily due to the impairment charges discussed above 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 6018 million in 2010 an increase of 1365 million or 293 compared to 4654 million in 2009 as a percentage of net sales adjusted ebitda was 68 in 2010 compared to 65 in 2009 

we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2010 and 2009 in the table below ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical 

measure of a company’s performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements see “selected financial data” included elsewhere in this report for a reconciliation of ebitda to cash flows from operating activities 

  

 seasonality 

while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year sales in our corporate segment which primarily serves business customers are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year additionally sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we finance our operations and capital expenditures through a combination of internally generated cash from operations and from borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility we believe that our current sources of funds will be sufficient to fund our cash operating requirements for the next year in addition we believe that in spite of the uncertainty of future macroeconomic conditions we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available to meet our longerterm needs however there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions 

cash flows 

we have revised our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 see notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities were as follows 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 decreased 2090 million  compared to 2010 the decrease was primarily driven by the changes in assets and liabilities resulting in a 3236 million  reduction in cash between years for 2011 the changes in assets and liabilities excluding cash and cash equivalents reduced cash by 1583 million  compared to a cash contribution of 1653 million in 2010 the most significant driver of the cash contribution in 2010 was an increase in accounts payabletrade of 2693 million  as we reduced the amount of accelerated payments we made in exchange for early pay discounts at december 31 2010 compared to the prior year accounts payabletrade decreased 198 million  in 2011 compared to 2010 resulting in a relatively small reduction in cash cash flow from operating activities was further reduced by 837 million  in 2011 compared to 2010 following an increase in accounts receivable between years driven by higher fourth quarter net sales in 2011 during 2011 we collected 533 million in cash tax refunds which reduced other assets between years resulting in an increase in cash flow from operating activities net income including the impact of noncash items such as gains and losses on extinguishment of longterm debt increased 1146 million  between years reflecting our improved operating results in 2011 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 increased 3161 million compared to 2009 this increase was primarily driven by the changes in assets and liabilities between years for 2010 the changes in assets and liabilities excluding cash and cash equivalents contributed 1653 million to cash compared to changes in assets and liabilities for 2009 that decreased cash by 180 million the changes in assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in accounts payabletrade as we reduced the amount of accelerated payments we made in exchange for early pay discounts at december 31 2010 compared to the prior year accounts payabletrade also increased more significantly in 2010 compared to the prior year to support the growth of the business and increased inventory levels net income including the impact of noncash items also increased 1328 million between years given the improved operating performance in 2010 

in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs we monitor our cash conversion cycle defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory less days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable the following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle 



 the cash conversion cycle decreased to 27  days at december 31 2011 compared to 32 days at december 31 2010 driven by a sixday increase in dpo the increase in dpo reflects a higher combined balance of accounts payabletrade and 

accounts payableinventory financing at december 31 2011 compared to december 31 2010 as purchase volumes increased to support higher net sales and we received more favorable payment terms for payables related to certain vendors the oneday increase in dso primarily reflects our overall sales growth and a higher proportion of government sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 

the cash conversion cycle decreased to 32 days at december 31 2010 compared to 41 days at december 31 2009 this decrease was primarily due to a sixday increase in dpo reflecting a higher accounts payable balance as we reduced the amount of accelerated payments we made in exchange for early pay discounts at december 31 2010 compared to the prior year end a threeday decrease in dso due primarily to lower federal government sales within the public segment also contributed to the decrease in the cash conversion cycle 

for tax purposes we were deemed to have paid a redemption premium in connection with the amendment to the senior secured term loan facility in december 2010 that in addition to certain expenses we deducted in determining taxable income as a result we incurred a net operating loss for tax purposes that resulted in a receivable of 533 million for refunds of previously paid income taxes as of december 31 2011 we had received the full amount of the refunds 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2011 decreased 694 million  compared to 2010 this decline was primarily due to a reduction in cash payments between years of 715 million  under our interest rate swap agreements as the 66 million paid in 2011 reflected the final payment upon termination of the swap agreements on january 14 2011 capital expenditures were 457 million  for 2011 and 415 million for 2010 primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years during 2011 and 2010 we paid 37 million  and 59 million respectively for new interest rate cap agreements 

net cash used in investing activities in 2010 increased 428 million compared to 2009 this was primarily due to an increase of 259 million in capital expenditures in 2010 compared to 2009 capital expenditures in 2010 consisted mainly of improvements to our information technology systems in addition cash payments under our interest rate swap agreements in 2010 increased 60 million as a result of increases in the spread between the variable rate of the underlying debt and the fixed rate of the swap agreements we made premium payments totaling 59 million during 2010 for four forwardstarting interest rate cap agreements during 2009 we received cash proceeds of 52 million from the sale of the informacast assets 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 2547 million  in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily driven by higher cash contributions of 2473 million  from accounts payableinventory financing as discussed below under the caption “inventory financing arrangements” in june 2011 we entered into a new inventory financing agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from a certain vendor inventory purchases from this vendor under the new agreement are included in accounts payableinventory financing and reported as cash flows from financing activities a combination of the increase in overall purchase volume under inventory financing agreements to support higher net sales in 2011 along with more favorable payment terms under the new inventory financing agreement drove the majority of the increase in cash flows from financing activities during 2011 compared to 2010 the net impact of our debt transactions resulted in cash outflows of 3464 million  during 2011 compared to cash outflows of 3527 million  during 2010 

net cash used in financing activities increased 3182 million for 2010 compared to 2009 this change was primarily due to net repayments of 3033 million that reduced our outstanding balance under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility we did not make any repayments under that facility in 2009 

longterm debt and financing arrangements 

longterm debt excluding capital leases was as follows 



as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements as described below 

senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “revolving loan” 

at december 31 2011 we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan 17 million of undrawn letters of credit and 2190 million reserved related to the floorplan subfacility 

on june 24 2011 we entered into the revolving loan a new fiveyear 9000 million senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility with the facility being available to us for borrowings issuance of letters of credit and floorplan financing for certain vendor products the revolving loan matures on june 24 2016 subject to an acceleration provision discussed below the revolving loan replaced our previous revolving loan credit facility that was to mature on october 12 2012 the revolving loan i increased the overall revolving credit facility capacity available to us from 8000 million to 9000 million ii increased the maximum aggregate amount of increases that may be made to the revolving credit facility from 1000 million to 2000 million iii added a maturity acceleration provision based upon excess cash availability whereby the revolving loan may mature 45 days prior to both the maturity of the nonextended portion of our senior secured term loan facility and the maturity of our senior exchange notes due 2015 if excess cash availability does not exceed the outstanding borrowings of the subject maturing debt at the time of the test plus 150 million iv increased the fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility from 25 basis points to either 375 or 50 basis points depending on the amount of utilization v increased the applicable interest rate margin and vi incorporated a 3000 million floorplan subfacility which was increased to 4000 million on august 2 2011 in connection with the termination of the previous facility we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 16 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 representing a writeoff of a portion of unamortized deferred financing costs fees of 72 million related to the revolving loan were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the term of the facility on a straightline basis 

as described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in connection with the floorplan subfacility we entered into the revolving loan financing agreement amounts outstanding under the revolving loan financing agreement are unsecured and noninterest bearing we will either pay the outstanding revolving loan financing agreement amounts when they become due or the revolving loans administrative agent will automatically initiate an advance on the revolving loan and use the proceeds to pay the balance on the due date as of december 31 2011 we owed the financial intermediary 2122 million under the revolving loan financing agreement which excludes 68 million in reserves for open orders that reduce the availability under the revolving loan the total amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payableinventory financing related to the revolving loan financing agreement includes 2122 million owed to the financial intermediary and 285 million accrued for product in transit changes in cash flows from the revolving loan financing agreement are reported in financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 

borrowings under the revolving loan bear interest at a variable interest rate plus an applicable margin the variable interest rate is based on one of two indices either i libor or ii the alternate base rate “abr” with the abr being the greatest of a the prime rate b the federal funds effective rate plus 50 basis points or c the onemonth libor plus 100 the applicable margin varies 200 to 250 for libor borrowings and 100 to 150 for abr borrowings depending 

upon our average daily excess cash availability under the agreement and after september 30 2011 is subject to a reduction of 025 if and for as long as the senior secured leverage ratio is less than 30 the senior secured leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of senior secured debt including amounts owed under certain inventory floorplan arrangements and capital leases less cash and cash equivalents to adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters the margins on the previous revolving loan credit facility varied from 100 to 175 for libor borrowings and 000 to 075 for abr borrowings 

availability under the revolving loan is limited to a the lesser of the revolving commitment of 9000 million and the amount of the borrowing base less b outstanding borrowings letters of credit and amounts outstanding under the revolving loan financing agreement plus a reserve of 15 of open orders the borrowing base is a the sum of the products of the applicable advance rates on eligible accounts receivable and on eligible inventory as defined in the agreement less b any reserves at december 31 2011 the borrowing base was 10721 million as supported by eligible inventory and accounts receivable balances as of november 30 2011 we could have borrowed up to an additional 6793 million under the revolving loan at december 31 2011 

cdw llc is the borrower under the revolving loan all obligations under the revolving loan are guaranteed by parent and each of cdw llcs direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries borrowings under the revolving loan are collateralized by a first priority interest in inventory excluding inventory collateralized under the inventory floorplan arrangements as described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements deposits and accounts receivable and a second priority interest in substantially all other assets the revolving loan contains negative covenants that among other things place restrictions and limitations on the ability of parent and each of cdw llcs direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries to dispose of assets incur additional indebtedness incur guarantee obligations prepay other indebtedness make distributions or other restricted payments create liens make equity or debt investments make acquisitions engage in mergers or consolidations or engage in certain transactions with affiliates the revolving loan also includes maintenance of a minimum average daily excess cash availability requirement should we fall below the minimum average daily excess cash availability requirement for five consecutive business days we become subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio until such time as the daily excess cash availability requirement is met for 30 consecutive business days 

senior secured term loan facility “term loan” 

at december 31 2011 the outstanding principal amount of the term loan was 15405 million with 4845 million of nonextended loans and 10560 million of extended loans the effective weightedaverage interest rate on term loan principal amounts outstanding on december 31 2011 was 398 per annum for the year ended december 31 2011 the effective weightedaverage interest rate without giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements was 434 per annum and the effective weightedaverage interest rate including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements was 451 per annum the interest rate swap agreements terminated on january 14 2011 

borrowings under the term loan bear interest at either a the abr plus a margin or b libor plus a margin the margin is based on our senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the amended agreement evidencing the term loan effective with the march 2011 amendment discussed below the margins were reduced on extended loans for abr borrowings the applicable margin varies within a range of 250 to 300 for nonextended loans and 175 to 225 for extended loans for libor borrowings the applicable margin varies within a range of 350 to 400 for nonextended loans and 275 to 325 for extended loans the nonextended loans mature on october 10 2014 the extended loans mature on july 15 2017 the maturity of the extended loans was subject to acceleration to july 15 2015 if as of july 14 2015 i the senior secured leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 300 to 100 and ii the outstanding principal amount of senior notes with a maturity date of october 12 2015 is greater than or equal to 5000 million we completed a cash tender offer and followon cash tender offer in 2011 described below and as a result of the reduction in the outstanding balances of the senior notes due 2015 the maturity of extended loans will not be accelerated by reason of this provision 

on march 11 2011 we entered into an amendment to the term loan which became effective on march 14 2011 this amendment among other things i reduced the margins with respect to extended loans ii established a libor floor of 125 and an abr floor of 225 with respect to extended loans iii reset the start date for accumulating restricted payments that count against the general limit of 250 million and iv provided a 1 prepayment premium for certain repayments or repricings of any extended loans for the six month period following the effective date of the amendment in connection with this amendment we recorded a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of 32 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 this loss represents a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the term loan 

the term loan requires us to make certain mandatory prepayments of principal amounts under certain circumstances including i a prepayment in an amount equal to 50 of our excess cash flow for a fiscal year the percentage rate of which 

can decrease based upon the total net leverage ratio as defined in the governing agreement and ii the net cash proceeds from the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness by us or our subsidiaries excess cash flow is defined as adjusted ebitda plus items such as reductions in working capital less items such as increases in working capital certain taxes paid in cash interest that will be paid in cash capital expenditures and repayment of longterm indebtedness on march 16 2011 we made a mandatory prepayment of 1320 million with respect to the year ended december 31 2010 under the excess cash flow provision we estimate a mandatory prepayment of approximately 2010 million will be due in 2012 under the excess cash flow provision with respect to the year ended december 31 2011 the payment is due within ten business days of the filing of this report with the sec on february 2 2012 we made an optional prepayment of 1200 million aggregate principal amount and on february 14 2012 we made an additional optional prepayment of 600 million aggregate principal amount the prepayments were allocated on a pro rata basis between the extended and nonextended loans the optional prepayments will reduce the amount of the required excess cash flow payment on a dollar for dollar basis 

cdw llc is the borrower under the term loan all obligations under the term loan are guaranteed by parent and each of cdw llcs direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries the term loan is collateralized by a second priority interest in substantially all inventory excluding inventory collateralized under the inventory floorplan arrangements as described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements deposits and accounts receivable and by a first priority interest in substantially all other assets the term loan contains negative covenants that among other things place restrictions and limitations on the ability of parent and each of cdw llcs direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries to dispose of assets incur additional indebtedness incur guarantee obligations prepay other indebtedness make distributions or other restricted payments create liens make equity or debt investments make acquisitions engage in mergers or consolidations or engage in certain transactions with affiliates 

the term loan also includes a senior secured leverage ratio requirement the senior secured leverage ratio is required to be maintained on a quarterly basis and is defined as the ratio of senior secured debt including amounts owed under certain inventory floorplan arrangements and capital leases less cash and cash equivalents to adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters compliance may be determined after giving effect to a designated equity contribution to the company to be included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda the senior secured leverage ratio for the four quarters ended december 31 2011 was required to be at or below 725 for the four quarters ended december 31 2011 the senior secured leverage ratio was 27 the senior secured leverage ratio is a material component of the term loan noncompliance with the senior secured leverage ratio requirement would result in a default under the credit agreement governing the term loan and could prevent us from borrowing under our revolving loan if there were an event of default under the credit agreement governing the term loan that was not cured or waived the lenders under the term loan could cause all amounts outstanding under the term loan to be due and payable immediately which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and cash flows for a discussion of net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities see “cash flows” above for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net cash provided by used in operating activities see “selected financial data”

inventory financing agreements 

we have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions as described below at december 31 2011 and 2010 we owed a total of 2787 million and 282 million respectively under these agreements these amounts are classified separately as accounts payableinventory financing on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

in june 2011 we entered into the revolving loan which incorporates a 4000 million floorplan subfacility to facilitate the purchase of inventory from a certain vendor in connection with the floorplan subfacility we entered into an inventory financing agreement on an unsecured basis with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from this vendor the “revolving loan financing agreement” amounts outstanding under the revolving loan financing agreement are unsecured and noninterest bearing at december 31 2011 we owed 2407 million under this agreement including 285 million accrued for product in transit 

from time to time we may enter into an agreement with a financial intermediary relating to the purchase of inventory from a supplier who has factored its receivables to the financial intermediary our obligations under these agreements are not collateralized we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due at december 31 2011 and 2010 we owed a financial intermediary 303 million and 186 million respectively under such an agreement 

at december 31 2011 we had inventory floorplan arrangements in place allowing for a maximum credit line of 110 million collateralized by the inventory purchases under these floorplan arrangements financed by the financial intermediaries and a second lien on the related accounts receivable we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due at december 31 2011 and 2010 we owed the financial intermediaries 77 million and 96 million respectively under these inventory floorplan arrangements 

contractual obligations 

we have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments operating leases and asset retirement obligations the following table presents our estimated future payments under contractual obligations that existed as of december 31 2011 based on undiscounted amounts 



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

commitments and contingencies 

we are party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business including various pending litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state and local authorities by various customers including government agencies relating to sales under certain contracts and by vendors in addition from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws in such cases certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

as of december 31 2011 we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters if any has been incurred however the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable as such our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers including oems software publishers and wholesale distributors we record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale delivery has occurred andor services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our shipping terms typically specify fob destination at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 

revenues from the sales of hardware products or software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales these items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways including i as physical product shipped from our warehouse ii via dropshipment by the vendor or iii via electronic delivery for software licenses at the time of sale we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience our vendor oems warrant most of the products we sell 

we leverage dropship arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs we recognize revenue for dropship arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify fob destination we recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer we set the price of the product charged to the customer we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced and we work closely with our customers to determine their hardware and software specifications these arrangements generally represent approximately 20 to 30 of total net sales 

revenue from professional services is either recognized as incurred for services billed at an hourly rate or recognized using the percentage of completion method for services provided at a fixed fee revenue for data center services including internet connectivity web hosting server colocation and managed services is recognized over the period service is provided 

we also sell certain products for which we act as an agent products in this category include the sale of thirdparty services warranties or software assurance “sa” sa is an “insurance” or “maintenance” product that allows customers to upgrade at no additional cost to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the sa is in effect these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale under net sales recognition the cost paid to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 

our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements “eas” under eas customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year regardless of changes to their employee base customers are charged an annual trueup fee for changes in the number of users over the year with most eas our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount in certain instances we bill the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer 

from time to time we sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of the products and services for each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting revenue is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element as determined by our selling price for the deliverable when it is sold on a standalone basis 

we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a cost of sales vendor rebates are recorded over the period earned as a reduction of cost of sales price protection is recorded when earned as a reduction to cost of sales or merchandise inventory as applicable 

deferred revenue includes 1 payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services and 2 amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met   

we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales intransit to customers at the end of each period based on a weightedaverage analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes dropship arrangements this analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount of sales intransit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been received by the customer changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period 

inventory valuation 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value cost is determined using a weightedaverage cost method we decrease the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand specifically known inventoryrelated risks and assumptions about future demand and market conditions if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

vendor programs 

we receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates bid programs price protection and other programs these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or advertising expense as appropriate vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs which could have an impact on our results of operations 

we record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets if actual performance does not match our estimates we may be required to adjust our receivables we record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors’ inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims however if actual collections differ from our estimates we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments we are required to perform an evaluation of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment the annual test for impairment is conducted as of december 1 testing for impairment of goodwill is a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is considered the most indicative of the reporting units’ fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn under the market approach we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for peer group companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company we have weighted the income approach and the market approach at 75 and 25 respectively 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit and the allocation of that fair value to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the event a step two analysis is required is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include primarily but are not limited to discount rate terminal growth rate selection of appropriate peer group companies and control premium applied and forecasts of revenue growth rates gross margins operating margins and working capital requirements the allocation requires analysis to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including among others customer relationships trade names and property and equipment any changes in the judgments estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results although we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may vary significantly and may expose us to material impairment charges in the future 

intangible assets include customer relationships trade names internally developed software and other intangibles intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software these intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we take into consideration historical loss experience the overall quality of the receivable portfolio and specifically identified customer risks if actual collections of customer receivables differ from our estimates additional allowances may be required which could have an impact on our results of operations 

income taxes 

deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis this evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

we account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

recent accounting pronouncements 

testing goodwill for impairment 

in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201108 which is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying amount using the qualitative assessment the entity would not be required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test for that reporting unit this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted we plan to adopt the guidance on january 1 2012 and do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

presentation of comprehensive income 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 which amends current guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income the new guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity it requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the guidance does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 

in december 2011 the fasb issued asu 201112 which defers certain provisions of asu 201105 including the requirement within asu 201105 to present reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 

the amendments in asu 201105 and asu 201112 are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 as this guidance impacts presentation only we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

fair value measurements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 the new guidance results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” the new guidance does not extend the use of fair value accounting but provides guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within gaap or ifrs this update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption prohibited for public entities as this guidance only requires additional disclosure we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in january 2010 the fasb issued asu 201006 to amend and expand the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements the guidance requires new disclosures about transfers in and transfers out of levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements and presentation of the activities within level 3 fair value measurements presented gross in a roll forward of activity the guidance also clarifies existing disclosures about the level of disaggregation of fair value for each class of assets and liabilities and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value except for the disclosures in the roll forward of activity in level 3 fair value measurements asu 201006 was effective for us as of january 1 2010 the disclosures in the roll forward of activity in level 3 fair value measurements became effective for us as of january 1 2011 as this guidance only required additional disclosure and we did not have any level 3 fair value measurements the adoption of asu 201006 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

revenue arrangements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued two asus to authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements asu 200913 modifies the criteria for separating consideration in multipledeliverable arrangements establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the relative selling price of a deliverable eliminates the residual method of allocation and expands the disclosures related to multipledeliverable revenue arrangements from time to time we sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables which may include a combination of products and services for each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting revenue is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element as determined by our selling price for the deliverable when it is sold on a standalone basis we adopted the amended guidance in asu 200913 on a prospective basis as of january 1 2011 this adoption did not significantly change our units of accounting or the method we use to allocate revenue to separate units of accounting and consequently did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

asu 200914 modifies the scope of authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements to exclude from its requirements 1 nonsoftware components of tangible products and 2 software components of tangible products that are sold licensed or leased with tangible products when the software components and nonsoftware components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality we adopted the amended guidance in asu 200914 on a prospective basis as of january 1 2011 the adoption of asu 200914 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

subsequent events 

on february 2 2012 we announced that we had commenced a tender offer the “2012 senior notes tender offer” to purchase any and all of the outstanding 1290 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which expired on march 2 2012 concurrently we announced that we had priced an offering of 1300 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2019 senior notes at an issue price of 104375 of par which closed on february 17 2012 

on february 17 2012 we announced that we had accepted for purchase 1206 million principal amount of the outstanding senior notes representing approximately 935 of the outstanding senior notes that were tendered by february 16 2012 on march 5 2012 we accepted for purchase an additional 01 million principal amount of the outstanding senior notes that were tendered prior to the expiration of the tender offer on march 2 2012 we have called for redemption on march 19 2012 the remaining 83 million principal amount of senior notes that were not tendered 

the proceeds from the issuance of 2019 senior notes together with cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving loan were used to fund the purchase of the senior notes tendered pursuant to the 2012 senior notes tender offer including the payment of tender and consent consideration accrued and unpaid interest and transaction fees and expenses and the payment of the redemption price and accrued and unpaid interest of the senior notes called for redemption 

in connection with the purchase of the senior notes under the 2012 senior notes tender offer and the call for redemption we expect to record a loss on extinguishment of longterm debt of approximately 9 million in our consolidated statement of operations in the first quarter of 2012 the loss represents tender offer consideration redemption price payments and the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the senior notes 

on february 2 2012 we made an optional prepayment of 1200 million aggregate principal amount of the term loan on february 14 2012 we made an additional optional prepayment of 600 million the prepayments were allocated on a pro rata basis between the extended and nonextended loans the optional prepayments will reduce the amount of the required mandatory prepayment due in 2012 under the excess cash flow provision of the term loan on a dollar for dollar basis with respect to the year ended december 31 2011 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks 

our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates the interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility and our senior secured term loan facility are floating and therefore are subject to fluctuations in order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility we have entered into interest rate derivative agreements to hedge a portion of the cash flows associated with the facility our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

w e utilize interest rate caps for the purpose of limiting current and future exposure to interest rate risk on our floatingrate debt under the senior secured term loan facility 

in april 2010 the company entered into four interest rate cap agreements with a combined 11000 million notional amount under these agreements the company made premium payments totaling 59 million to the counterparties in exchange for the right to receive payments from them of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 35 during the agreement period the cap agreements are effective from january 14 2011 through january 14 2013 

during 2011 the company entered into four interest rate cap agreements with a combined 5000 million notional amount under the agreements the company made premium payments totaling 37 million to the counterparties in exchange for the right to receive payments from them of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 35 during the agreement period the cap agreements are effective from january 14 2013 through january 14 2015 

these interest rate cap agreements have not been designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk for accounting purposes instead these agreements are recorded at fair value on the companys consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded directly to interest expense net in the companys consolidated statements of operations each period

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

introduction 

this compensation discussion and analysis provides an overview of the companys executive compensation philosophy and the material elements of compensation earned by our named executive officers with respect to 2011 

our named executive officers consist of our current chief executive officer our chairman and former chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three other most highly compensated executive officers named executive officers on october 1 2011 as part of the companys planned succession mr edwardson retired from the position of chief executive officer of the company and agreed to continue to serve as chairman of the board of managers of cdw holdings and cdw llc through the end of 2012 and mr richards the companys president and chief operating officer was elected to the position of president and chief executive officer of the company 

for 2011 the named executive officers were 

 on october 12 2007 we were acquired by a company controlled by investment funds affiliated with the equity sponsors the “acquisition” following the acquisition the compensation committees of cdw holdings our ultimate parent company and cdw llc collectively have responsibility for determining the compensation of our named executive officers the two compensation committees are comprised of the same members each of whom was appointed by the equity sponsors for purposes of this compensation discussion and analysis these two compensation committees are collectively referred to as the “committee” 

establishing and evaluating executive compensation 

executive compensation philosophy and objectives 

the committee believes that the companys executive compensation programs should reward actions and behaviors that drive longterm profitable revenue growth at abovemarket rates while also rewarding the achievement of shortterm performance goals the following objectives are grounded in a payforperformance philosophy and provide a framework for the companys executive compensation programs 

 consistent with the companys payforperformance philosophy and executive compensation program objectives adjustments to executive compensation levels have historically been based on individual and company performance with reference to the compensation levels paid to similarly situated executive officers at the company and market data has been used by the committee to provide a perspective on executive compensation 

market comparisons 

the committee considers relevant market pay practices when establishing and evaluating executive compensation which are based on peer group data and compensation survey data each of the companies in the companys peer group meet one or more of the following criteria i operated in the same line of business as the company ii operated “close” to the companys line of business iii operated in a businesstobusiness distribution environment or iv competed with the company for talent the 2011 peer group consisted of the following companies    

utilizing the companys peer group aon hewitt compiles compensation data from its general industry compensation survey in compiling compensation data aon hewitt may supplement the peer group data with data from other companies included in its general industry compensation survey if aon hewitt determines that a particular executive position is not sufficiently represented in the peer group aon hewitt statistically adjusts the compensation data provided to the committee on the basis of revenue to allow the committee to review the data on a sizeadjusted basis 

in reviewing the compensation paid to each named executive officer the committee supplements the aon hewitt peer group data with data taken from technology industry surveys prepared by radford a leading provider of compensation market data while the radford surveys include information regarding over 1000 companies the committees use of the surveys was limited to a review of us compensation data derived from technology companies in the surveys that for purposes of decisions made prior to march 2011 had annual revenues in excess of 10 billion for the committees review of possible merit salary increases in march 2011 and actions thereafter the committee used data derived from technology companies in the surveys that had annual revenues in excess of 30 billion which was a newly available survey data cut provided by radford the committee reviewed depending on the availability of data within the survey for the position being considered market data derived from between 12   and 82 of the technology companies included in the survey which companies had median annual revenues of between 3080 billion and 11570 billion 

for mr edwardson and mr richards midyear compensation changes related to the planned ceo succession the committee reviewed peer group data for the other named executive officers the committee reviewed blended market data with the peer group data and compensation survey data weighted equally for purposes of this compensation discussion and 

analysis the peer group data and compensation survey data are collectively referred to as “market data” 

in order to evaluate the competitiveness and reasonableness of the companys executive compensation program the committee compares base salary to the market 50th percentile and total target cash compensation and total compensation including longterm incentive opportunity to a market range of the 50th to 75th percentile the total cash compensation opportunity for an executive is generally set to provide above market median total cash compensation for performance above market growth rate expectations in conjunction with market data the committee also considers the executives overall responsibilities individual performance against company goals and leadership impact when establishing appropriate compensation levels 

independent compensation consultant 

frederic w cook  co the “compensation consultant” was retained by the committee to advise on compensation matters relating to the appointment of mr richards to the position of president and chief executive officer and the retirement of mr edwardson the compensation consultant did not provide any additional services to the company in 2011 

role of executive officers 

the committee is responsible for all compensation decisions for our named executive officers mr edwardson while serving as the companys chief executive officer reviewed the performance of each executive officer and based on these reviews made recommendations to the committee with respect to 2011 compensation 

elements of compensation 

the companys executive compensation program consists of the following principal elements 

 base salary 

the committee generally sets base salaries for executives including the named executive officers below the market median of salaries for executives in similar positions and with similar responsibilities at companies included in the market data aligned with our compensation philosophy a large proportion of executives total target cash compensation is nonfixed or variable to provide a strong connection between pay and performance accordingly in 2011 mr richards base salary was 40 of his total target cash compensation mr edwardsons base salary was 39 of his total target cash compensation and the base salaries for the other named executive officers ranged from 28 to 50 of their total target cash compensation 

based on the advice of the compensation consultant and the committees review of market data mr richards base salary increased from 700000 to 775000 when he assumed the position of chief executive officer in october 2011 in connection with mr edwardsons retirement as chief executive officer and continuation as chairman mr edwardson and the company entered into an amended employment agreement that provided for reductions in mr edwardsons base salary over the duration of such agreement although market data supported the continuation of mr edwardsons current base salary level for the duration of his employment agreement mr edwardson recommended to the committee that his base salary be reduced over the term of his agreement accordingly mr edwardsons base salary will be reduced as follows 

   

with respect to mr campbell and ms corley the committee set their base salaries when they joined the company in 2011 in determining each executives base salary level the committee considered market data and the base salaries paid to similarly situated executive officers at the company 

annual cash incentive awards senior management incentive plan 

cdw provides its senior management with shortterm incentive compensation through its annual cash bonus program the senior management incentive plan “smip” shortterm compensation under smip is a significant component of an executives total target cash compensation opportunity in a given year 

as noted above the committee generally assesses an executives total target cash compensation for competitiveness and reasonableness against the market data the total cash compensation opportunity for an executive is generally set to provide above market median total cash compensation for performance above market growth rate expectations because the named executive officer base salary levels historically have been below the 50 th  percentile of market data the committee has long relied on smip to provide a significant component of the named executive officers total target cash compensation for 2011 mr richards smip target award represented 60 of his total target cash compensation mr edwardsons smip target award represented 61 of his total target cash compensation and the smip target awards for our other named executive officers ranged from 50 to 72 of their respective total target cash compensation 

when mr richards assumed the role of chief executive officer the committee set mr richards annual smip target at 150 of base salary which resulted in mr richards 2011 smip target increasing from 1050000 to 1162500 the increased target was prorated to apply to the portion of 2011 during which he served as chief executive officer in determining mr richards smip target the committee considered the advice of the compensation consultant as well as market data    with respect to mr campbell and ms corley the committee set their annual smip targets when they joined the company in 2011 at 275000 mr campbell and ms corleys 2011 smip targets were prorated to reflect the portion of the year in which each named executive officer was employed by the company in determining mr campbell and ms corleys smip targets the committee considered market data and the smip targets for similarly situated executive officers at the company 

in establishing annual performance goals under smip the committee undertakes a rigorous review and analysis to ensure that the performance goals correlate to above market performance factors considered by the committee in establishing the performance goals include market growth rate expectations and company market share gain expectations as well as assumptions regarding the companys productivity gains and investments 

the committee believed that a combination of adjusted ebitda and market share performance was the most meaningful measure of the companys 2011 performance for its stakeholders because together they take into account not only the companys absolute performance but also performance relative to the market adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the calculation of adjusted ebitda 

for 2011 the committee set the annual adjusted ebitda performance goal at 659 million additionally the threshold payout level was set so as to require the company to meet or exceed prior year adjusted ebitda results for any incentive payments to be made to senior management under smip consistent with the 2010 smip design the committee also included a market share factor as a mechanism to adjust payments under smip this design feature adjusts smip awards based on the companys financial and operational success relative to market 

in operation therefore payment of awards under smip for performance during 2011 was guided by three principles 

 the smip payout curve had a payout range from 0 to 200 of each participants target smip award for performance between 913 and 115 of the adjusted ebitda goal with different levels of payout for increased or constantdecreased market share and no payout if the company failed to achieve 2010 adjusted ebitda performance the threshold target and maximum payout opportunities under the smip payout curve are set forth below 



 in 2011 the committee determined that the company had achieved 109 of its adjusted ebitda performance goal and after assessing the data described in footnote 2 above determined that the companys market share grew resulting in a payout percentage of 160 of each named executive officers bonus target the table below sets forth the smip payouts to each of the named executive officers based upon 2011 performance 

 longterm incentive program 

the equity sponsors believe that members of senior management should hold a personally significant interest in the equity of the company to align their interests and the interests of our stakeholders as described below the equity sponsors implemented their management investment philosophy by requiring members of senior management to invest in the company and by establishing a “profitsinterest program” “profitsinterest programs” are common practice in portfolio companies of private equity firms and allow participants to share in increases in the equity value of the company 

a units 

the equity sponsors investment in the company is held in the form of class a common units of cdw holdings “a units” mr richards ms ziegler and each of our current named executive officers who were with the company at the time of the acquisition were required to invest in a units of cdw holdings 

b unit program 

the company granted class b common units of cdw holdings “b units” in 2007 to each of our current named executive officers who was with the company at the time of the acquisition the committee has the authority to grant b units to new members of senior management and additional b units to current members of senior management a units and b units each represent an equity interest in cdw holdings however the b unit grants have what is called a “participation threshold” set based on the value assigned to an a unit at the time of the b unit grant the b units only share in equity appreciation above the participation threshold this places the b unit grants in a secondary position to the a units in that in any event in which the equity is valued and paid out holders of the b unit grants are paid only if an amount at least equal to 

the participation threshold has first been allocated to the a units the a units and the b unit grants share equally in valuation amounts if any above the participation threshold 

in connection with the commencement of their employment in 2011 the committee granted to mr campbell and ms corley 4783 b units and 52455 b units respectively in determining the size of the awards the committee considered the companys historical grant practices with respect to similarly situated executive officers at the company in 2011 other than the new hire grants to mr campbell and ms corley the committee did not authorize the grant of any additional b units to any of the named executive officers 

on june 30 2011 the board approved the terms of a class b common unit grant agreement modification letter with mr edwardson the modification letter provides that mr edwardsons unvested b units will continue to vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in his grant agreement through 2014 provided that mr edwardson continues to perform services through december 31 2012 or experiences a qualifying termination of employment mr edwardson is terminated without cause or resigns with good reason prior to that date in connection with his class b common unit grant agreement modification letter mr edwardson agreed to extend the term of his noncompetition covenant through december 31 2016 

for additional information about the b units granted to the named executive officers in 2011 as well as the modification to mr edwardsons class b unit grant agreement see the narrative accompanying the “grants of planbased awards table” the table entitled “2011 outstanding equity awards at fiscal yearend” and the “2011 units vested table” below 

rdu plan 

in 2010 the board adopted the restricted debt unit plan the “rdu plan” which was designed to retain key leaders and focus them on driving the longterm success of the company the rdu plan is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan participants in the rdu plan receive restricted debt units “rdus” that entitle the participant to a proportionate share of payments under the rdu plan determined by dividing the number of rdus held by the participant by 28500 which is the total number of rdus available under the rdu plan each rdu represents 1000 of face value of the senior subordinated notes 

the rdus are designed to track two components of the senior subordinated notes a principal component and an interest component however the participants have no rights to the underlying debt the total amount of compensation available under the rdu plan is based on these two components the principal component credits the rdu plan with an amount equal to 285 million face value of the senior subordinated notes the “debt pool” payment of the principal component under the rdu plan will be made to participants on october 12 2017 unless accelerated due to a sale of the company the interest component credits the rdu plan with amounts equal to the interest that would have been earned on the debt pool from march 10 2010 or the date of hire if later through maturity october 12 2017 these amounts will be paid to participants on the interest payment dates except that amounts for 2010 and 2011 are deferred until 2012 

in connection with the commencement of their employment in 2011 mr campbell and ms corley each received 400 rdus the committee set the size of mr campbell and ms corleys awards at levels that maintained the companys compensation practice of providing a significant portion of each executives compensation in the form of atrisk variable compensation while also delivering a competitive compensation package to the executive in 2011 other than the new hire grants to mr campbell and ms corley the committee did not authorize the grant of any additional rdus to any of the named executive officers 

for additional information regarding the operation of the rdu plan and the rdus granted to the named executive officers see the narrative accompanying the “2011 nonqualified deferred compensation” table and the “2011 potential payments upon termination or change in control” section 

severance benefits 

the companys employment arrangements with each of the named executive officers provide for payments and other benefits in connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment with the company the committee believes that these severance benefits i help secure the continued employment and dedication of the named executive officers ii enhance the companys value to a potential acquirer because the named executive officers have noncompetition nonsolicitation and confidentiality provisions that apply after any termination of employment including after a change in control of the company and iii are important as a recruitment and retention device as many of the companies with which we compete for executive talent have similar agreements in place for their senior management 

additional information regarding the employment arrangements with each of the named executive officers including a 

quantification of benefits that would have been received by each named executive officer had his or her employment terminated on december 30 2011 the last business day in 2011 is provided under “2011 potential payments upon termination or change in control” 

other benefits 

our named executive officers participate in the companys corporatewide benefit programs our named executive officers are offered benefits that are commensurate with the benefits provided to all fulltime cdw coworkers which includes participation in the companys qualified defined contribution plan consistent with the companys performancebased culture the company does not offer a servicebased defined benefit pension plan or other similar benefits to its coworkers similarly the company does not provide nonqualified retirement programs or perquisites that are often provided at other companies to the named executive officers 

compensation committee report 

the cdw llc compensation committee together with the compensation committee of cdw holdings llc has responsibility for determining the compensation of our named executive officers the compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the compensation discussion and analysis with management and based on such review and discussion the compensation committee recommended to the board of directors of cdw corporation that the compensation discussion and analysis be included in cdw corporation’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2011 and such other filings with the sec as may be appropriate

transactions with equity sponsors 

madison dearborn and providence equity are private equity firms that have investments in companies that purchase products or services from or provide products or services to the company we believe that such transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of business on terms no less favorable to us than terms that could have been reached with an unaffiliated third party 

review and approval of transactions with related persons 

the charter of the audit committee of cdw holdings gives the audit committee the responsibility to review all transactions with related persons according to the charter no related person transaction may be entered into unless and until it has been approved by the audit committee for these purposes a related person transaction is considered to be any transaction that is required to be disclosed pursuant to item 404 of the secs regulation sk 

potential related person transactions are identified based on information submitted by our officers and managers and then submitted to the audit committee for review the audit committee takes into account all relevant considerations in deciding whether to approve the transaction these considerations may but need not include 

 director independence 

because affiliates of madison dearborn and providence equity own approximately 941 of the voting common units of cdw holdings we would be a “controlled company” within the meaning of rule 5615 of the nasdaq marketplace rules 

which would qualify us for exemptions from certain corporate governance rules of the nasdaq stock market inc including the requirement that the board of directors be composed of a majority of independent directors

history 

cdw was founded in 1984 in 2003 we purchased selected us assets and the canadian operations of micro warehouse which extended our growth platform into canada in 2006 we acquired berbee information networks corporation a provider of technology products solutions and customized engineering services in advanced technologies primarily across cisco ibm and microsoft portfolios this acquisition increased our capabilities in customized engineering services and managed services 

on october 12 2007 cdw corporation an illinois corporation was acquired through a merger transaction by an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with madison dearborn partners llc and providence equity partners inc the “acquisition” cdw corporation continued as the surviving corporation and same legal entity after the acquisition but became a wholly owned subsidiary of vh holdings inc a delaware corporation 

  

on december 31 2009 cdw corporation merged into cdwc llc an illinois limited liability company owned by vh holdings inc with cdwc llc as the surviving entity this change had no impact on our operations or management on december 31 2009 cdwc llc was renamed cdw llc “cdw llc” on august 17 2010 vh holdings inc was renamed cdw corporation “parent” a delaware corporation 

throughout this report the terms “the company” “cdw” and “successor” refer to parent and its wholly owned subsidiaries subsequent to the acquisition and “predecessor” refers to cdw corporation an illinois corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries prior to the acquisition 

parent is owned directly by cdw holdings llc a company controlled by investment funds affiliated with madison dearborn partners llc and providence equity partners inc the “equity sponsors” certain other coinvestors and certain members of cdw management see “equity sponsors” below 

industry overview 

according to international data corporation “idc” the overall us technology market generated approximately 536 billion in sales in 2010 including 176 billion in hardware sales 144 billion in software sales and 216 billion in services sales the channels through which these products and services are delivered are highly fragmented and served by a multitude of participants these participants include original equipment manufacturers “oems” software publishers wholesale distributors and resellers wholesale distributors such as ingram micro inc tech data corporation and synnex corporation act as intermediaries between oems and software publishers on the one hand and resellers on the other hand providing logistics management and supplychain services resellers which include direct marketers valueadded resellers etailers and retailers sell products andor services directly to the enduser customer sourcing products sold to their customers directly from oems and software publishers or from wholesale distributors cdw is a technology solutions provider with both direct marketer and valueadded reseller capabilities 

two key customer groups within our addressable market are the small and medium business market and the public sector market the small and medium business market is highly fragmented and is generally characterized by companies that employ fewer than 1000 employees the public sector market is also fragmented and is generally divided into market verticals each with specialized needs that require an adaptive and flexible sales services and logistics model to meet customer needs we believe that many vendors rely heavily on channel partners like cdw to efficiently serve small and medium business and public sector customers 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following strengths have contributed to our success and enabled us to become an important strategic partner for both our customers and our vendor partners 

significant scale and scope 

we are a leading multibrand technology solutions provider in the us and canada based upon publicly available information we believe that our net sales are significantly larger than any other multibrand direct marketer or valueadded reseller in the us our significant scale and scope create competitive advantages through 

 

  

  

   

coworker culture 

our steadfast focus on serving customers and investing in coworkers has fostered a strong “get it done” culture at cdw since our founding we have adhered to a core philosophy known as the circle of service which places the customer at the center of all of our actions we have consistently and cost effectively invested in our coworkers by providing broad and deep coworker training supplying resources that contribute to their success and offering them broad career development opportunities this constant focus on customers and coworkers has created a customercentric highly engaged coworker base which ultimately benefits our customers and fosters customer loyalty 

large and knowledgeable direct selling organization 

we have a large and experienced sales force consisting of more than 3400 coworkers including more than 2700 account managers and field account executives we believe our success is due in part to the strength of our account managers’ dedicated relationships with customers that are developed by calling on existing and new customers providing advice on products responding to customer inquiries and developing solutions to our customers’ complex technology needs the deep industry knowledge of our dedicated sales marketing and support resources within each of our customer channels allows us to understand and solve the unique challenges and evolving technology needs of our customers multiple customer surveys administered by independent parties consistently show that customers view cdw as a leader in customer service compared to other multibrand resellers and solution providers 

highly skilled technology specialists and engineers 

our direct selling organization is supported by a team of more than 600 technology specialists and more than 400 service delivery engineers with more than 3000 industryrecognized certifications who bring deep product and solution knowledge and experience to the technology challenges of our customers we believe our technology specialists who work with customers and our direct selling organization to design solutions and provide recommendations in the selection and procurement process are an important resource and differentiator for us as we seek to expand our offerings of valueadded services and solutions 

large and established customer channels 

we have grown our customer channels within the corporate and public segments to sizeable businesses our government education healthcare and small business channels each has net sales that approach or exceed 1 billion our scale allows us to create specialized sales resources across multiple customer markets which enables us to better understand and meet our customers’ evolving it requirements our scale also provides us diversification benefits for instance our public segment which is comprised of our government education and healthcare channels has historically been less correlated to economic cycles as evidenced by its 5 net sales growth in 2009 while overall technology spending declined in the us market according to idc 

strong established vendor partner relationships 

we believe that our strong vendor partner relationships differentiate us from other multibrand technology solutions providers in addition to providing a costeffective route to market for vendor partners we believe that many of our competitive strengths enhance our value proposition to our vendor partners we believe we are an important extension of our vendor partners’ sales and marketing capabilities as we are the largest us reseller for many of our vendor partners including hewlettpackard we have three vendor partners with whom we have annual 1 billionplus relationships and we have 15 vendor partners with whom we have relationships exceeding 100 million a year as such we are able to provide technology resources and insights to our customers that might otherwise be difficult for them to access independently or through other technology providers our direct selling organization technology specialists and large customer channels allow us to develop intimate knowledge of our customers’ environments and their specific needs frequently vendor partners will select cdw as a partner to develop and grow new customer solutions we are regularly recognized with top awards from our vendor partners and were recently named microsoft’s worldwide large account reseller partner of the year and cisco’s partner summit global award for us and canada partner of the year 

our business strategies 

our goal is to continue to strengthen our position as a leading multibrand national provider of technology products and solutions by growing our revenues and driving profitability we plan to achieve this objective by capitalizing on our competitive strengths and pursuing the following strategies 

focus on customer requirements and market segmentation 

we have grown our revenues faster than the market which we attribute in large part to our focus on customer requirements and market segmentation we believe our customer intimacy enables us to better understand our customers’ needs and to better identify profitable growth opportunities we intend to maintain this focus with a goal of continuing to outpace our competitors in revenue growth in the markets we serve through increased “share of wallet” from existing customers sales to new customers and expanded it services offerings to both new and existing customers we believe our efforts in these areas will be augmented as we improve our sales coverage and further segment our customer base further leverage our knowledge of our customers’ environments and continue to help our customers adopt proven technologies that meet their needs and make the most of their it investments 

  

leverage our superior sales and marketing model 

we intend to continue to leverage our large highly productive sales and marketing organization to serve existing customer requirements effectively target new customer prospects improve our product and solutions offerings maximize sales resource coverage strategically deploy internal sales teams technology specialists and field sales account executives and strengthen vendor partner relationships all with the end goal of creating profitable sales opportunities some of the initiatives we have implemented within the last few years including our realignment of our medium and large corporate account managers into geographic regions our addition of selling resources to our federal and healthcare customer channels and our addition of more technology specialists to facilitate sales of newer and more profitable technology solutions have contributed to an increase in our annualized net sales per coworker from 1338 million for the quarter ended march 31 2007 to 1455 million for the quarter ended december 31 2010 we plan to continue to identify and pursue opportunities that further enhance productivity recently we have added sales operations supervisors to handle administrative tasks for our direct sales force coworkers which we believe will further enhance their productivity and we have continued to align our compensation programs to drive profitable revenue growth 

meet our customers’ changing needs through expanded service offerings and solutions 

we intend to expand the range of technology solutions we offer to continue to keep pace with the technology marketplace as customers increasingly demand more elaborate services and solutions in addition to traditional hardware and software products we believe that expanding the range of technology solutions that we offer will enhance our value proposition to our customers and help us to maximize our revenue and profit growth potential we have tripled our number of technology specialists since mid2004 and added almost 400 services delivery engineers since mid2006 cdw currently has more than 600 technology specialists organized around core solutions and aligned with our selling organization and more than 700 coworkers in 17 geographic markets across the us focused on delivering customized engineering solutions we plan to continue to invest resources and training in our technology specialists and services delivery coworkers to provide our customers with the expert advice and experience they need to make the most of their technology expenditures 

leverage relationships with leading vendor partners 

we intend to continue to leverage our longstanding relationships with major vendor partners to support the growth and profitability of our business we plan to use our vendor partner relationships to ensure that our sales organization remains wellpositioned and welltrained to market new and emerging technologies to end users as one example we are currently working with several large vendor partners to assist them in the development and sales of cloud solutions to the small and medium business marketplace we believe our strong vendor partner relationships will also provide collaborative opportunities for our sales organization and vendor field sales representatives to identify and fulfill additional customer requirements creating increased sales to both new and existing customers in addition we plan to leverage our significant scale to maximize the benefits from volume discounts purchase or sales rebates vendor incentive programs and marketing development funds 

hardware software and valueadded service offerings

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect our business and the results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some important factors that may cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our business and our ability to incur additional indebtedness could intensify these risks 

we are a highly leveraged company and our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay amounts due in respect to our indebtedness as of december 31 2010 we had 429 billion of total debt and capitalized lease obligations outstanding and 96 million of obligations outstanding under our trade financing agreements and the ability to borrow an additional 5480 million under our senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility the “revolving loan” subject to the limits contained in our senior credit facilities and indentures we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time including drawing on our revolving loan to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our business associated with our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 restrictive covenants under our senior credit agreements and indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity 

our senior credit agreements and our indentures contain and any future indebtedness of ours may contain various covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit agreements or indentures the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these amounts and exercise other remedies if such indebtedness were to be accelerated there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full 

  

variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

certain of our borrowings primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk as of december 31 2010 we had 18606 million of variable rate debt outstanding if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income would decrease although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility we cannot assure you we will be able to do so in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective 

risks related to our business 

general economic conditions could negatively affect technology spending by our customers and put downward pressure on prices which may have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

weak economic conditions generally sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions or a prolonged or further tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows for example during the economic downturn at the end of 2008 and in 2009 due to a number of factors including declines in the availability of credit weakening consumer and business confidence and increased unemployment we experienced significantly reduced revenue and gross margins when our customers and potential customers reduced their spending on technology and put downward pressure on prices 

our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public segment customers 

our sales to our public segment customers are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels although our sales to the federal government are diversified across multiple agencies and departments they collectively accounted for 110 of 2010 net sales an adverse change in government spending policies budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products 

we purchase products for resale from vendor partners which include oems and software publishers and wholesale distributors for the year ended december 31 2010 we purchased approximately 47 of the products we sold directly from vendor partners and the remaining amount from wholesale distributors we are authorized by vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs including purchase rebates sales volume rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements however we do not have any longterm contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party in addition a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

from time to time vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us for example there is no assurance that as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to resellers like us any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

although we purchase from a diverse vendor base in 2010 products we purchased from distributors ingram micro tech data and synnex represented approximately 13 12 and 11 respectively of our total purchases in addition sales of apple cisco hewlettpackard lenovo and microsoft products comprise a substantial portion of our sales representing approximately 50 of net sales in 2010 sales of products manufactured by hewlettpackard represented approximately 24 of our 2010 net sales the loss of or change in business relationship with any of these or any other key vendor partners the diminished availability of their products or backlogs for their products leading to manufacturer allocation could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position additionally the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for and the cost of working capital and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows further mergers among manufacturers could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or cash flows 

  

our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware software and services offerings we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware software and services offerings as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers a decrease in the rate of innovation or the lack of acceptance of innovations by customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware software and services offerings for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell such new offerings to customers our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware software and services to compete effectively with hardware software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels to the extent that a vendor’s offering that is highly in demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted 

substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance 

our current competition includes 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors 

some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell and could intensify their efforts to sell their products directly to customers in addition traditional oems are increasing their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers moreover newer potentially disruptive technologies exist and are being developed that deliver technology solutions as a service for example software as a service “saas” and hardware as a service “haas” these technologies could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through resellers like us or could lead to a reduction in our profitability if any of these trends becomes more prevalent it could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers we may be required to reduce prices increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows additionally some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales which may require us to reduce prices this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the success of our business depends on the continuing development maintenance and operation of our information technology systems 

our success is dependent on the accuracy proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems including our business systems web servers and voice and data networks the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades affects among other things our ability to 

 

  

   

  

 the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats including computer viruses and malicious hackers there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective furthermore although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business and results of operations 

breaches of data security could impact our business 

our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of coworkers customers and others in addition we operate three customer data centers which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers in connection with our services business our coworkers also have access to our customers’ confidential data and other information we have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches however breaches in security could expose us our customers or other individuals to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability for us as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant such breaches costs and consequences could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

the failure to comply with our public segment contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things fines or other liabilities and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

revenues from our public segment customers are derived from sales to governmental departments and agencies educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales sales to public segment customers are highly regulated noncompliance with contract provisions government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations including but not limited to the false claims act and the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute could result in civil criminal and administrative liability including substantial monetary fines or damages termination of government contracts or other public segment customer contracts and suspension debarment or ineligibility from doing business with the government and other customers in the public segment in addition generally contracts in the public segment are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or upon default the effect of any of these possible actions by any governmental department or agency could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows in addition the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins which could have a negative effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

if we fail to provide highquality services to our customers or if our thirdparty service providers fail to provide highquality services to our customers our reputation business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

our service offerings include field services managed services warranties configuration services and partner services additionally we deliver and manage mission critical software systems and network solutions for our customers finally we also offer certain services such as implementation and installation services and repair services to our customers through various thirdparty service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf if we or our thirdparty service providers fail to provide high quality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers’ businesses our reputation with our customers and our business results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 

if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 

our success is in part dependent upon our ability to attract develop and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business including executive management sales service and technical coworkers if we are unable to do so our operating results could be negatively impacted we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract develop and retain personnel as and when necessary in the future further we make a significant investment in the training of our sales and services personnel our inability to retain such personnel or to train them effectively to meet our needs could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales and services personnel which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

  

the interruption of the flow of products from international suppliers could disrupt our supply chain 

a significant portion of the products we sell are manufactured or purchased by our vendor partners outside of the us primarily in asia political social or economic instability in asia or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell could cause disruptions in trade including exports to the us other events that could also cause disruptions to exports to the us include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell are purchased or manufactured or may be purchased or manufactured in the future will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments including the likelihood type or effect of any such restrictions trade restrictions including new or increased tariffs or quotas embargos safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell as well as foreign labor strikes and work stoppages or boycotts could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business 

substantially all of our corporate warehouse and distribution functions are located at our vernon hills illinois facilities and our second distribution center in north las vegas nevada if the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence we could utilize the other distribution center or thirdparty distributors to ship products to our customers however this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs in addition we operate three customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both businesscritical data and confidential information of our customers a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are heavily dependent on commercial delivery services 

we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services our profitability could be adversely affected additionally strikes or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 

we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks 

we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales typically on 30day payment terms we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or in the case of public segment customers during periods of budget constraints 

we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies including our rapidturn inventory model as well as vendor price protection and product return programs however if we were unable to maintain our rapidturn inventory model if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions our inventory risks could increase we also periodically take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand these bulk purchases could increase our exposure to inventory obsolescence 

  

we could be exposed to additional risks if we make acquisitions or enter into alliances 

we may pursue transactions including acquisitions or alliances in an effort to extend or complement our existing business these types of transactions involve numerous risks including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience entering into new geographic markets the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses any of which could adversely affect our operations 

our future operating results may fluctuate significantly 

we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations these fluctuations may result from many factors including the condition of the technology industry in general shifts in demand and pricing for hardware software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades 

our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors some of which may be outside of our control including pricing pressures changes in product costs from our vendor partners the availability of price protection purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners changes in product order size and customer mix the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers and general market and competitive conditions 

in addition our cost structure is based in part on anticipated sales and gross margins therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we may have higher than anticipated tax liabilities 

we are subject to various taxes in the us and canada our effective income tax rate and overall tax expenses may be adversely impacted by various factors many of which our outside or our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we report our results based on our determination of the amount of taxes we owe in various tax jurisdictions in which we operate the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax related liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is subject to review or examination by tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a negative impact on our results and financial condition the resolution of various tax examinations audits and disputes may differ from the liabilities recorded in our financial statements and may adversely affect our financial results and cash flows 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims 

we rely on copyright trademark trade secret and patent laws as well as confidentiality invention assignment nonsolicitation and noncompetition agreements to protect our intellectual property there can be no assurance that these laws and agreements will provide sufficient protection of our intellectual property and it is possible that third parties may obtain and use our confidential information and trade secrets without authorization or infringe on our intellectual property rights which could impair our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

  

from time to time in the ordinary course of business parties assert various intellectual property infringement claims against us including allegations of patent infringement either because of our business systems or because we resell allegedly infringing hardware software or services if there is a determination that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others we could incur substantial monetary liability be forced to stop selling infringing products or providing infringing services be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements if available or be prevented from using the intellectual property rights which could force us to change our business systems or hardware software or services offerings in the future 

we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits 

we are party to various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we are also subject to audits by federal state and local authorities by various customers including government agencies relating to sales under certain contracts and by vendors current and future litigation governmental proceedings and audits that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome in addition current and future litigation governmental proceedings or audits could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations litigation governmental proceedings and audits involve uncertainties and it is possible that the eventual outcome of any litigation governmental proceeding or audit could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are controlled by the equity sponsors whose interests may differ from our other stakeholders 

substantially all of the common stock of parent is held indirectly by investment funds affiliated with or coinvestment vehicles controlled by the equity sponsors as a result the equity sponsors control us and have the power to elect all of the members of parent’s board of directors and approve any action requiring the approval of the holders of parent’s stock including approving acquisitions or sales of all or substantially all of our assets the directors appointed by the equity sponsors have the ability to control decisions affecting our capital structure including the issuance of additional debt and capital stock the declaration of dividends and to appoint new management if we encounter financial difficulties or we are unable to pay our debts as they mature the interests of the equity sponsors might conflict with the interests of our other equity holders debt holders or other stakeholders additionally the equity sponsors are in the business of investing in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the equity sponsors may also separately pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us since our equity securities which are not registered under the exchange act are not listed on any us securities exchange we are not subject to any of the corporate governance requirements of any us securities exchange

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2010 we owned or leased a total of approximately 21 million square feet of space throughout the us and canada we own two properties a combined office and an approximately 450000 square foot distribution center in vernon hills illinois and an approximately 513000 square foot distribution center in north las vegas nevada in addition we conduct sales services and administrative activities in various leased locations throughout north america including data centers in madison wisconsin and minneapolis minnesota

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are party to legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business including various pending litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state and local authorities by various customers including government agencies relating to sales under certain contracts and by vendors in addition from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws in such cases certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

we do not believe that any current audit or pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition litigation and audits however involve uncertainties and it is possible that the eventual outcome of litigation or audits could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations for a particular period 

  

the investment banks that were initial parties to our amended and restated senior bridge loan agreement and amended and restated senior subordinated bridge loan agreement requested in a letter to us dated april 18 2008 that we issue longterm debt securities to refinance the bridge loans we issued under those agreements the letter further requested that if we did not issue these longterm debt securities additional interest accrue under those agreements at the same rates that would have been applicable to the longterm debt securities had they been issued on that date if the banks were to pursue these claims we believe that the maximum amount at issue would be approximately 806 million we do not believe that we were required to issue any longterm debt securities in 2008 and therefore do not believe that we owe any additional interest accordingly we did not accrue any amount in respect thereof as of december 31 2010 or for any prior periods

overview 

we are a leading multibrand technology solutions provider to business government education and healthcare customers in the us and canada we provide comprehensive and integrated solutions for our customers’ technology needs through our extensive hardware software and valueadded service offerings our breadth of offerings allows our customers to streamline their procurement processes by partnering with us as a complete technology solutions provider our hardware offerings include products with leading brands across multiple categories such as network communications notebooksmobile devices data storage video monitors printers desktops and servers among others our software offerings include licensing licensing management and software solutions and services that help our customers to optimize their software investments we offer a fullsuite of valueadded services which typically are delivered as part of a technology solution to help our customers meet their specific needs our solutions range from configuration services for computer devices to fullyintegrated solutions such as virtualization collaboration security mobility data center optimization and cloud computing we also offer complementary services including installations sales of warranties and managed services such as remote network and data center monitoring we believe both software and service offerings will be important growth areas for us in the future 

we have two reportable segments corporate which is comprised primarily of business customers and public which is comprised of government entities and education and healthcare institutions our corporate segment is divided into mediumlarge business primarily serving customers having between 100 and 1000 employees and small business primarily serving customers with up to 100 employees we also have two other operating segments cdw advanced services and canada which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and accordingly are combined together as “other” the cdw advanced services business consists primarily of customized engineering services delivered by cdw professional engineers and managed services including hosting and data center services revenues from the sale of hardware software custom configuration and third party provided services are recorded within our corporate and public segments 

our business is welldiversified across customers product and service offerings and vendors from whom we purchase products for resale we have aligned our sales and marketing functions around customer channels to retain and increase our sales to existing customers and to acquire new customers we have an experienced and dedicated direct selling organization consisting of account managers who provide inside sales coverage and field account executives who work within an assigned territory and interact with customers in person our direct selling organization is supported by a team of technology specialists who design solutions and provide recommendations in the selection and procurement processes we purchase products for resale from oems and distributors we believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy we are authorized by oems to sell via direct marketing all or selected products offered by the manufacturer we also operate as a reseller for major software publishers that allows the enduser customer to acquire packaged software or licensed products and services our authorization with each oem or software publisher may include one or more of the following product return privileges price protection policies purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs such as volume rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements 

we market the cdw brand on a national basis through a variety of public and community relations and corporate communications efforts and through brand advertising that includes the use of print broadcast online social and other media we also market to current and prospective customers through integrated marketing programs that include print and online media events and sponsorships as a result of our relationships with our vendors a substantial portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising reimbursement programs such programs are at the discretion of our vendors and are typically tied to sales or purchasing volumes or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time 

an important factor affecting our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted operating results is the impact of general economic conditions on our customers’ willingness to spend on information technology during the recent economic downturn beginning in late 2008 and into 2009 we experienced significantly lower sales and gross profit as our customers generally reduced spending on information technology products and services during 2010 we experienced significant increases in sales gross profit and operating income compared to 2009 while general economic conditions and our recent operating results have generally improved competitive pricing pressures continue in the market downturns in the global economy declines in the availability of credit weakening consumer and business confidence or increased unemployment could result in reduced spending 

  

by our customers on information technology products and services and increased competitive pricing pressures our public segment sales are impacted by government spending policies budget priorities and revenue levels although our sales to the federal government are diversified across multiple agencies and departments they collectively accounted for 110 of our net sales in 2010 further our sales to state and local governments accounted for 46 of our net sales in 2010 an adverse change in any of these factors could cause our public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew contracts with us which could adversely affect our business results of operations or cash flows see “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report for further discussion 

our management monitors a number of financial and nonfinancial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales gross margin operating margin ebitda and adjusted ebitda cash and cash equivalents net working capital cash conversion cycle defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios sales per coworker and coworker turnover these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management so that actions can be taken as necessary in order to achieve the standards and objectives adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

the following table presents our results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

   

net sales 

the following table presents our net sales by segment in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change in net sales for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

  

 the following table presents our net sales by customer channel for our corporate and public segments and the dollar and percentage change between periods in net sales for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

 total net sales in 2010 increased 16385 million or 229 to 88012 million compared to 71626 million in 2009 there were 254 selling days in both 2010 and 2009 the increase in total net sales was the result of general growth and increased demand in the information technology industry overall in addition to our focus on growing our market share the most significant driver of sales growth in 2010 was the rebound by our corporate segment which was significantly impacted by the recent economic downturn 

corporate segment net sales in 2010 increased 10154 million or 266 compared to 2009 within our corporate segment net sales to medium  large customers increased 283 between years while net sales to small business customers increased 203 public segment net sales in 2010 increased 5251 million or 173 between years driven by growth across all customer channels net sales to healthcare customers increased 2671 million or 369 between years driven by volume increases and additional sales resulting from an expanded relationship with a group purchasing organization beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009 

gross profit 

gross profit increased 2580 million or 228 to 13908 million in 2010 compared to 11329 million in 2009 which reflected increased sales across our hardware software and services categories the increase in gross profit dollars was driven primarily by unit growth and favorable pricemix within the hardware category though hardware product margin remained relatively flat between years as a percentage of total net sales gross profit was 158 in both 2010 and 2009 driven by continued competitive pressures in the marketplace vendor funding including purchase discounts volume rebates and cooperative advertising increased in 2010 but was relatively flat as a percentage of net sales between years following the first quarter of 2010 gross profit margin by quarter improved on a yearoveryear basis as general economic conditions improved 

the gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales product mix net service contract revenue commission revenue pricing strategies market conditions and other factors any of which could result in changes in gross profit margins 

  

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased 1110 million or 135 to 9321 million in 2010 compared to 8211 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher payroll costs of 1006 million as a result of higher sales compensation and increases in other variable compensation costs such as incentive bonuses consistent with higher sales and gross profit in addition coworkerrelated costs increased 155 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase of 119 million in profit sharing401k costs while travel and entertainment expense increased 25 million and sales and use tax expense increased 21 million these increases were partially offset by lower depreciation expense of 82 million and lower bad debt expense of 30 million in 2010 compared to 2009 throughout 2010 we continued to cautiously make selective investments in our coworkers as our outlook improved our sales force increased to 3405 coworkers at december 31 2010 compared to 3307 coworkers at december 31 2009 and total coworker count also increased to 6268 coworkers at december 31 2010 compared to 6173 coworkers at december 31 2009 

advertising expense 

advertising expense increased 40 million or 40 to 1060 million in 2010 compared to 1019 million in 2009 increased expenses related to the production of a new advertising campaign ecommerce support and customerfocused marketing events were partially offset by decreased spending in catalog production and circulation as a percentage of net sales advertising expense was 12 in 2010 compared to 14 in 2009 

goodwill impairment 

we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2010 as we performed and passed the annual evaluation of goodwill as of december 1 2010 the goodwill balances at december 31 2010 for our corporate public and other segments were 12230 million 9073 million and 788 million respectively 

we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 2418 million in 2009 continued deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and the overall decline in our net sales during the first half of 2009 indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of certain of our reporting units was reduced to below the respective carrying amount we considered this a triggering event under generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and performed an interim evaluation of goodwill as of june 1 2009 as a result of that goodwill impairment evaluation we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2350 million in the second quarter of 2009 this charge was comprised of 2070 million for our corporate segment or 14 of the total goodwill for that segment and 280 million for the cdw advanced services business or 38 of the total goodwill for that operating segment in addition to the goodwill evaluation noted above we recorded 68 million of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2009 for certain trade credits for periods prior to the acquisition which was immediately impaired upon recognition 

  

income loss from operations 

the following table presents income loss from operations by segment in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change in income loss from operations for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

  

  income from operations was 3527 million in 2010 an increase of 3846 million compared to a loss from operations of 319 million in 2009 this increase was primarily due to the prior period containing the previously discussed goodwill impairment charge of 2418 million excluding the goodwill impairment charge operating income increased 1429 million or 681 in 2010 compared to 2009 this increase was driven by higher net sales and gross profit dollars partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses although we continued to contain our selling and administrative expenses through tight cost control 

corporate segment income from operations was 2562 million in 2010 an increase of 3130 million compared to a loss from operations of 567 million in 2009 the operating loss in 2009 was due to the goodwill impairment charge of 2124 million excluding the goodwill impairment charge corporate segment income from operations increased 1006 million or 646 between years the most significant driver of our corporate segment’s increase in operating income between years was the rebound in net sales which increased 266 in 2010 compared to 2009 following the economic downturn the combination of the increased net sales and the associated gross profit dollars along with continued control of selling and administrative costs increased operating income by 608 million selling and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of net sales in 2010 compared to 2009 despite the increased investment in coworkers discussed above in addition our corporate segment income from operations benefited in 2010 from an increase of 460 million in income allocations from our logistics operations compared to 2009 the improved profitability of our logistics operations was driven by increased operating leverage given higher purchase volumes in 2010 while support structure costs decreased between years partially offsetting the above items was an increase in headquarters’ allocations of 62 million 

public segment income from operations was 1930 million in 2010 an increase of 423 million or 280 compared to 1507 million in 2009 this increase reflected higher operating income of 204 million as a result of higher net sales and gross profit dollars while continuing to control selling and administrative costs selling and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of net sales in 2010 compared to 2009 despite the increased investment in coworkers discussed above in addition our public segment income from operations benefited in 2010 from an increase of 289 million in income allocations from our logistics operations compared to 2009 partially offsetting the above items was an increase in headquarters’ allocations of 70 million 

the income from operations within our other segment was 143 million in 2010 compared to a loss from operations of 232 million in 2009 the operating loss for 2009 was a result of the goodwill impairment charge of 283 million for the cdw advanced services business 

the loss from operations for our headquarters’ function of 1108 million was 81 million higher than the loss of 1027 million in 2009 the incremental loss of 81 million in 2010 reflected an increase in costs of 230 million partially offset by higher intercompany allocations to the operating segments of 149 million the 230 million cost increase in 2010 was driven by additional investments in coworkers primarily related to incentive compensation and profit sharing401k 

  

interest expense net 

at december 31 2010 our outstanding longterm debt excluding capital leases totaled 42891 million net interest expense was 3919 million in 2010 compared to 4317 million in 2009 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the yearoveryear change in the net noncash impact of hedge ineffectiveness recorded in interest expense on the interest rate swap agreements as described in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements which resulted in a gain of 258 million in 2010 compared to a loss of 287 million in 2009 also contributing to the decrease were lower average outstanding debt balances during 2010 compared to 2009 partially offsetting these items was a higher interest rate on the senior secured term loan facility as a result of the november 2009 amendment to this facility and increased expense due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements as described in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

net gain on extinguishments of longterm debt 

we recorded a net gain of 20 million on the extinguishment of longterm debt resulting from two transactions during 2010 

in march 2010 we repurchased 285 million of principal amount of the outstanding senior subordinated loansnotes for a purchase price of 186 million we recorded a gain of 92 million on the extinguishment of this debt in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2010 the gain represents the difference between the purchase price including expenses paid to the debt holders and agent and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs the 285 million in principal amount of loans was exchanged for increasing rate notes and subsequently surrendered to the indenture trustee for cancellation 

in december 2010 we extinguished 5000 million of the outstanding principal balance of our senior secured term loan facility as described in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements we recorded a loss of 72 million on the extinguishment of this debt in our consolidated statement of operations during the fourth quarter of 2010 this loss represents a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs on the senior secured term loan facility there was no additional gain or loss resulting from the paydown of the debt balance as the cash paid equaled the par value of the debt principal extinguished 

income tax benefit 

the income tax benefit was 78 million in 2010 compared to 878 million in 2009 the effective income tax rate expressed by calculating the income tax benefit as a percentage of loss before income taxes was 211 in 2010 compared to 190 in 2009 the change in the effective rate from 2009 to 2010 was due to the nondeductible goodwill charge in 2009 and a relatively higher impact on the effective tax rate of permanent items in 2010 due to the relatively small pretax loss in addition state taxes in 2010 were higher due to changes in state rates and apportionment 

net loss 

the net loss was 292 million in 2010 compared to a net loss of 3734 million in 2009 the yearoveryear change was primarily due to the impairment charges discussed above 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 6018 million in 2010 an increase of 1365 million or 293 compared to 4654 million in 2009 as a percentage of net sales adjusted ebitda was 68 in 2010 compared to 65 in 2009 

  

we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2010 and 2009 in the table below ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements see “selected financial data” included elsewhere in this report for a reconciliation of ebitda to cash flow from operating activities 

 

  

   

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

the following table presents our results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 net sales 

the following table presents our net sales by segment in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change in net sales for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

  

 the following table presents our net sales by customer channel for our corporate and public segments and the yearoveryear dollar and percentage change in net sales for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

   

total net sales in 2009 decreased 9086 million or 113 to 71626 million compared to 80712 million in 2008 there were 254 selling days in 2009 compared to 255 selling days in 2008 on an average daily basis total net sales decreased 109 the decline in total net sales between years was primarily the result of soft demand within our corporate segment due to the general economic conditions that existed in the us on a sequential quarterly basis the yearoveryear percentage decline in total net sales lessened each quarter as we progressed through the first three quarters of 2009 and we experienced modest net sales growth of 17 for the fourth quarter of 2009 

corporate segment net sales in 2009 decreased 10340 million or 213 compared to 2008 within our corporate segment net sales to our medium  large customers decreased 227 between years while net sales to our small business customers decreased at a lesser rate of 157 the decline in corporate segment net sales was the result of overall weak customer demand as hardware sales in particular succumbed to a widespread recession beginning in late 2008 public segment net sales in 2009 increased 1408 million between years or 49 almost entirely due to sales growth within our government channel the increase in government net sales was driven by an increase in large orders defined to be in excess of 100000 to our federal customers 

gross profit 

gross profit decreased 2281 million or 168 to 11329 million in 2009 compared to 13610 million in 2008 this decrease was driven by a decline in hardware sales which reflected both lower volumes and unfavorable changes in pricemix as a percentage of net sales gross profit was 158 in 2009 compared to 169 in 2008 the decrease in gross profit margin between years was driven by lower product margin and to a lesser extent lower cooperative advertising from vendors as a percentage of net sales the decline in product margin was driven by competitive pressures in the marketplace product margin also generally declines as the proportion of public segment net sales to total net sales increases on a sequential quarterly basis gross profit margin declined each quarter as we progressed through the first three quarters of 2009 and moderated at 154 in the fourth quarter of 2009 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses decreased 737 million or 82 to 8211 million in 2009 compared to 8948 million in 2008 this was driven by a decrease of 617 million in payroll costs that resulted primarily from lower sales commissions and lower other variable incentive compensation as well as a decrease in the number of sales and nonsales coworkers our sales force decreased to 3307 coworkers at december 31 2009 compared to 3593 coworkers at december 31 2008 in addition to implementing cost saving actions such as cancelling certain merit compensation increases and suspending the 401k match for 2009 we eliminated approximately 200 coworkers in mostly nonsales force positions in january 2009 selling and administrative expenses in 2009 also reflected reduced profit sharing401k expense for 2008 the amount charged to expense for the profit sharing401k plan totaled 119 million of this amount we reversed 80 million to income in the second quarter of 2009 as the payout of this amount was partially based upon certain financial objectives in 2009 that were not achieved this reversal was partially offset by 64 million of plan expense recorded in 2009 resulting in a net credit of 16 million attributed to the profit sharing401k plan for 2009 these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 99 million in consulting and advisory fees and expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 

advertising expense 

advertising expense decreased 394 million or 279 to 1019 million in 2009 compared to 1413 million in 2008 as a percentage of net sales advertising expense decreased to 14 in 2009 compared to 18 in 2008 the decrease in advertising expense was primarily the result of less national tv and magazine advertising 

goodwill impairment 

we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 2418 million in 2009 and 17120 million in 2008 continued deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and the overall decline in our net sales during the first half of 2009 indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of certain of our reporting units was reduced to below the respective carrying amount we considered this a triggering event under gaap and performed an interim evaluation of goodwill as of june 1 2009 as a result of that goodwill impairment evaluation we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 2350 million in the second quarter of 2009 this charge was comprised of 2070 million for our corporate segment and 280 million for the cdw advanced services business for financial reporting purposes the cdw advanced services business is combined with canada and shown as “other” we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill for 2009 as of december 1 our public segment canada and cdw advanced services reporting units passed the first step of the goodwill evaluation with the fair value exceeding the carrying value by 9 30 and 35 respectively while our corporate segment reporting unit did not pass the first step accordingly we performed the second step of the goodwill evaluation for our corporate segment reporting unit the results of which did not require us to record an impairment charge as the implied fair value of goodwill of this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of goodwill by 10 in addition to the goodwill evaluations noted above we recorded 68 million of goodwill in the fourth 

  

quarter of 2009 for certain trade credits for periods prior to the acquisition which was immediately impaired upon recognition the goodwill balances at december 31 2009 for our corporate public and other segments were 12230 million 9073 million and 771 million respectively 

the total goodwill impairment charge of 17120 million in 2008 was comprised of 13590 million for our corporate segment and 3530 million for our public segment and was primarily the result of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008 see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on goodwill and the related impairment charges the goodwill balances at december 31 2008 for our corporate public and other segments were 14300 million 9073 million and 1047 million respectively 

loss from operations 

the following table presents loss from operations by segment in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and the yearoveryear percentage change in loss from operations for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

  

  the loss from operations was 319 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 13871 million in 2008 the operating losses were due to the previously discussed goodwill impairment charges of 2418 million in 2009 and 17120 million in 2008 excluding goodwill impairment charges operating income decreased 1150 million or 354 in 2009 compared to 2008 this decrease was driven by lower gross profit from lower margins on the 113 net sales decline for 2009 due to the economic slowdown partially offset by reduced advertising costs and lower selling and administrative expenses as a result of our overall cost savings strategy 

corporate segment loss from operations was 567 million in 2009 compared to 11042 million in 2008 the operating losses were due to the goodwill impairment charges of 2124 million in 2009 and 13590 million in 2008 excluding goodwill impairment charges operating income decreased 991 million or 389 in 2009 compared to 2008 our corporate segment was most significantly impacted by the economic slowdown as ensuing competitive pricing pressures resulted in lower margins on the 213 net sales decline for 2009 this was partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses mainly payroll costs for our sales force that resulted from reduced commissions and lower other variable incentive compensation and a lower number of sales coworkers 

public segment income from operations was 1507 million in 2009 compared to a loss from operations of 2164 million in 2008 public segment goodwill impairment charges were 11 million in 2009 and 3530 million in 2008 excluding goodwill impairment charges income from operations increased 152 million or 112 in 2009 compared to 2008 while pricing pressures and an increase in low margin large orders for our public segment resulted in lower gross profit between years this impact was largely offset by reduced selling and administrative expenses our public segment income from operations benefited in 2009 from an increase of 153 million in income allocations from our logistics operations compared to 2008 this allocation was primarily based on our public segment’s proportionate share of total net sales which increased between years 

  

the loss from operations within our other segment was 232 million in 2009 compared to income from operations of 102 million in 2008 the operating loss for 2009 was a result of the goodwill impairment charge of 283 million for the cdw advanced services business 

the loss from operations for our headquarters’ function of 1027 million in 2009 was 260 million higher than the loss of 767 million in 2008 the incremental loss of 260 million in 2009 reflected an increase in costs of 50 million and lower intercompany allocations to the segments of 210 million compared to 2008 the 50 million cost increase in 2009 was primarily due to an increase of 99 million in consulting and advisory fees and expenses previously discussed and 53 million of higher occupancy expenses related to sales office expansion partially offset by reductions in other areas as a result of cost savings actions 

interest expense net 

at december 31 2009 our outstanding longterm debt excluding capital leases totaled 46204 million net interest expense in 2009 was 4317 million compared to 3903 million in 2008 the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increasing interest rates under the bridge loans we entered into in connection with the acquisition this increase was partially offset by lower interest rates under the senior secured revolving credit facility which is based on libor for interest periods beginning prior to october 15 2009 we had made all interest payments in cash for the interest period from october 15 2009 through april 14 2010 we elected to defer interest payments on the 3000 million principal amount of loans under our bridge loans under which we may elect to pay pik interest and to add the deferred interest to the principal balance so that the deferred interest together with the principal would be due at maturity of such loans the principal amount on the loans all of which have subsequently been exchanged for notes under the senior exchange note indenture increased by approximately 170 million on april 15 2010 and we will incur incremental interest expense of approximately 107 million over the remaining term as a result 

income tax benefit 

the income tax benefit was 878 million in 2009 compared to 121 million in 2008 the effective income tax rate expressed by calculating the income tax benefit as a percentage of loss before income taxes was 190 in 2009 this rate differs from the rate of 07 in 2008 primarily due to the nondeductible nature of the goodwill impairment charges of 2418 million and 17120 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the effective income tax rate was also lower in 2008 due to adjustments to deferred state income taxes primarily to reflect a change in tax filing status of one of our subsidiaries and tax expense in certain jurisdictions where various subsidiaries were taxable 

net loss 

net loss was 3734 million in 2009 compared to 17651 million in 2008 the yearoveryear change was primarily due to the impairment charges discussed above 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 4654 million in 2009 a decrease of 1052 million or 184 from 5706 million in 2008 as a percentage of net sales adjusted ebitda was 65 in 2009 compared to 71 in 2008 

we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2009 and 2008 in the table below ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda which is a measure defined in our credit agreements means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered nongaap financial measures generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital requirements adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements see “selected financial data” included elsewhere in this report for a reconciliation of ebitda to cash flows from operating activities 

  

  

 seasonality 

while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year sales in our corporate segment which primarily serves business customers are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year additionally sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

we finance our operations and capital expenditures through a combination of internally generated cash from operations and from borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility we believe that our current sources of funds will be sufficient to fund our cash operating requirements for the next year in addition we believe that in spite of the uncertainty of future macroeconomic conditions we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available to meet our longerterm needs however there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions 

cash flows 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities were as follows 

 

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 increased 3284 million compared to 2009 this increase was driven primarily by changes in our investment in working capital between periods for 2010 the change in net working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents contributed 1685 million to cash compared to a change in net working capital for 2009 that decreased cash by 271 million our investment in working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents was lower at december 31 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in accounts payable as we reduced the amount of 

  

accelerated payments we made to in exchange for early pay discounts at december 31 2010 compared to the prior year end accounts payable also increased more significantly in 2010 compared to the prior year to support the growth of the business and increased inventory levels net income as adjusted for noncash items also increased 1328 million between years given the improved operating performance in 2010 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 decreased 758 million compared to 2008 this decrease was the result of a 757 million decrease between years in net income as adjusted for noncash items as the 113 decline in net sales for 2009 led to lower earnings in 2009 compared to 2008 the impact of our investment in working capital on cash was essentially flat between years however there were significant changes in the relative levels of certain components accounts receivable increased 1313 million during 2009 which reflected the fourth quarter 2009 increase in net sales of 17 between periods and an increase in days sales outstanding primarily for our public segment accounts receivable decreased 1167 million during 2008 primarily due to a fourth quarter 2008 decline in net sales of 94 between periods reflecting the slowdown in the economy inventory levels similarly increased slightly during 2009 to support yearend sales growth and decreased 786 million during 2008 in response to the economic slowdown partially offsetting these factors were changes in accounts payable accounts payable increased 674 million during 2009 primarily as a result of lower early pay discounts taken than as of the previous year end accounts payable decreased 1991 million during 2008 in response to lower inventory levels as sales declined and payments made to take advantage of incremental early pay discounts 

in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs we monitor our cash conversion cycle defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory less days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable the following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle 

 

  

   the cash conversion cycle decreased to 32 days at december 31 2010 compared to 41 days at december 31 2009 this decrease was primarily due to a sixday increase in dpo reflecting a higher accounts payable balance as we reduced the amount of accelerated payments we made in exchange for early pay discounts at december 31 2010 compared to the prior year end a threeday decrease in dso due primarily to lower federal government sales within the public segment also contributed to the decrease in the cash conversion cycle 

the cash conversion cycle increased from 39 days at december 31 2008 to 41 days at december 31 2009 the twoday increase was a result of an increase in dso from 44 days to 46 days at december 31 2008 and 2009 respectively this increase in dso was primarily driven by higher federal government sales within the public segment 

we were deemed for tax purposes to have paid a redemption premium in connection with the december 2010 term loan amendment that in addition to certain expenses is deductible in determining taxable income as a result we incurred a net operating loss for tax purposes that is expected to result in 54 million of refunds in 2011 of previously paid income taxes 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2010 increased 428 million compared to 2009 this was primarily due to an increase of 259 million in capital expenditures in 2010 compared to 2009 capital expenditures in 2010 consisted mainly of improvements to our information technology systems in addition cash payments under our interest rate swap agreements in 2010 increased 60 million as a result of increases in the spread between the variable rate of the underlying debt and the fixed rate of the swap agreements we made premium payments totaling 59 million during 2010 for four forwardstarting interest rate cap agreements during 2009 we received cash proceeds of 52 million from the sale of the informacast assets 

net cash used in investing activities for 2009 increased 223 million compared to 2008 an increase of 530 million in cash payments under our interest rate swap agreements in 2009 was partially offset by lower capital expenditures of 255 million in 2009 compared to 2008 the increase in cash payments under the swap agreements was primarily due to increases in the spread between the variable rate of the underlying debt and the fixed rate of the swap agreements capital expenditures were lower in 2009 as part of the overall focus on cost containment during 2009 

  

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities increased 3305 million in 2010 compared to 2009 this change was primarily due to net repayments of 3033 million that reduced the outstanding balance under our senior secured revolving credit facility we did not make any repayments under that facility in 2009 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 118 million for 2009 compared to 2008 we repaid 110 million under our senior secured term loan facility in 2009 compared to net debt proceeds of 139 million from additional borrowings in 2008 in addition we paid 113 million of deferred financing costs related to the amendment of our senior secured term loan facility in 2009 compared to 455 million of costs paid in 2008 

longterm debt and financing arrangements 

longterm debt excluding capital leases was as follows 

 

 as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements as described below 

senior secured assetbased revolving credit facility “revolving loan” 

at december 31 2010 we had an 8000 million revolving loan available for borrowings and issuance of letters of credit of which we had outstanding borrowings of 1881 million at an effective weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 171 per annum and 217 million of undrawn letters of credit borrowings under the revolving loan bear interest at a variable interest rate plus an applicable margin the variable interest rate is based on one of two indices either i libor or ii the alternate base rate “abr” with the abr being the greater of a the prime rate and b the federal funds effective rate plus 50 basis points the applicable margin varies 100 to 175 for libor borrowings and 000 to 075 for abr borrowings depending upon our average daily excess cash availability under the agreement the revolving loan matures on october 12 2012 availability under the revolving loan is limited to the lesser of the revolving commitment of 8000 million or the amount of the borrowing base the borrowing base is based upon a formula involving certain percentages of eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivable owned by us at december 31 2010 the borrowing base was 9085 million as supported by eligible inventory and accounts receivable balances as of november 30 2010 one of the lenders the “defaulting lender” under the revolving loan has failed to fund its pro rata share of several outstanding loan advances under the revolving loan since 2008 as a result actual availability under the revolving loan is 422 million less than it would otherwise be if the defaulting lender was honoring its commitments under the revolving loan agreement assuming nonfunding by the defaulting lender we could borrow up to an additional 5480 million under the revolving loan at december 31 2010 

cdw llc is the borrower under the revolving loan all obligations under the revolving loan are guaranteed by parent and each of cdw llc’s direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries borrowings under the revolving loan are collateralized by a first priority interest in inventory excluding inventory collateralized under the trade financing agreements as described in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements deposits and accounts receivable and a second priority interest in substantially all other assets the revolving loan contains negative covenants that among other things place restrictions and limitations on the ability of parent and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets incur additional indebtedness incur guarantee obligations prepay other indebtedness make distributions or other restricted payments create liens make equity or debt investments make acquisitions engage in mergers or consolidations or engage in certain transactions with affiliates the revolving loan also includes maintenance of a minimum average daily excess cash availability requirement should we fall below the minimum average daily excess cash availability requirement for ten consecutive business days we become subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio until such time as the daily excess cash availability requirement is met for 30 consecutive business days 

  

senior secured term loan facility “term loan” 

on december 2 2010 in connection with the issuance of the senior secured notes as described below we entered into an amendment of the term loan which became effective on december 17 2010 in connection with the amendment we agreed to repay 5000 million of the term loan from the proceeds of the senior secured notes the amendment to the term loan extended the final maturity of 11464 million principal amount of the term loan to july 15 2017 from october 10 2014 the “extended term loan” this extended maturity is subject to acceleration to july 14 2015 if as of july 14 2015 i the senior secured leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 300 to 100 and ii the outstanding principal amount of senior unsecured debt with a maturity date of october 12 2015 is greater than or equal to 5000 million further the amendment among other things 1 increased the applicable margin for the interest rate with respect to the extended term loan by 100 and 2 permitted the issuance of the senior secured notes and the grant of security interests in the collateral for the senior secured notes term loan lenders holding 5261 million principal amount of the term loan chose not to extend the maturity of their loans the “nonextended term loan” the nonextended term loan continues to be subject to the original maturity date of october 10 2014 and these lenders will not receive the increased interest rate with respect to these loans we recorded a loss of 72 million on the extinguishment of 5000 million of the term loan in the consolidated statement of operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 representing a writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the term loan

trade financing arrangements 

we have entered into security agreements with certain financial institutions in order to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions at december 31 2010 the agreements allowed for a maximum credit line of 745 million collateralized by the inventory purchases financed by the financial institutions and certain other assets we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due at december 31 2010 and 2009 we owed the financial institutions 96 million and 250 million respectively which is included in trade accounts payable 

contractual obligations 

we have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments capital and operating leases and asset retirement obligations the following table presents our estimated future payments under contractual obligations that existed as of december 31 2010 based on undiscounted amounts 

 

  

      offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contingencies 

we are party to legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business including various pending litigation matters we are also subject to audit by federal state and local authorities by various customers including government agencies relating to sales under certain contracts and by vendors in addition from time to time certain of our customers file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the us bankruptcy laws in such cases certain prepetition payments received by us could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator 

we do not believe that any current audit or pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition litigation and audits however involve uncertainties and it is possible that the eventual outcome of litigation or audits could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations for a particular period 

  

the investment banks that were initial parties to our amended and restated senior bridge loan agreement and amended and restated senior subordinated bridge loan agreement requested in a letter to us dated april 18 2008 that we issue longterm debt securities to refinance the bridge loans we issued under those agreements the letter further requested that if we did not issue these longterm debt securities additional interest accrue under those agreements at the same rates that would have been applicable to the longterm debt securities had they been issued on that date if the banks were to pursue these claims we believe that the maximum amount at issue would be approximately 806 million we do not believe that we were required to issue any longterm debt securities in 2008 and therefore do not believe that we owe any additional interest accordingly we did not accrue any amount in respect thereof as of december 31 2010 or for any prior periods 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates 

in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers including oems software publishers and wholesale distributors we record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale delivery has occurred andor services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our usual shipping terms are fob destination at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the time of sale we record an estimate for sales returns and pricing disputes based on historical experience our vendor oems warrant most of the products we sell 

revenues from the sale of hardware products or software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales software products and licenses can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways including i as physical product shipped from our warehouse ii via dropshipment by the vendor or iii via electronic delivery 

revenue from professional services is either recognized as incurred for services billed at an hourly rate or recognized using the percentage of completion method for services provided at a fixed fee revenue for managed services such as web hosting and server colocation is recognized over the period service is provided from time to time the sale of professional services may be bundled with hardware or software products to better meet the needs of our customers in cases where this occurs we allocate revenues to each element of the sale based on its relative fair value using vendorspecific objective evidence 

we also sell certain products for which we act as an agent products in this category include the sale of third party services extended warranties or software assurance “sa” sa is an “insurance” or “maintenance” product that allows customers to upgrade at no additional cost to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the sa is in effect these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and thus are recognized on a net basis under net sales recognition the cost to the vendor or thirdparty service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 

our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements “eas” under eas customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year regardless of changes to their employee base customers are charged an annual trueup fee for changes in the number of users over the year with most eas our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount in certain instances we bill the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer 

we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a cost of sales 

  

deferred revenue includes i payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services and ii amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met 

we estimate the revenues associated with products that have shipped but that have not yet been received by our customer and record an adjustment to reverse the impact of these sales and related cost of sales out of our results for the current period and into our results for the subsequent period in doing so we perform an analysis to determine the estimated number of days that product is in transit using data from commercial delivery services and other sources changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the current period 

inventory valuation 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value cost is determined using a weightedaverage cost method we decrease the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand specifically known inventoryrelated risks and assumptions about future demand and market conditions if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

vendor programs 

we receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances volume rebates bid programs price protection and other programs these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or advertising expense as appropriate vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs which could have an impact on our results of operations 

we record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets if actual performance does not match our estimates we may be required to adjust our receivables we record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors’ inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims however if actual collections differ from our estimates we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments we are required to perform an evaluation of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment the annual test for impairment is conducted as of december 1 we changed our annual goodwill evaluation date to december 1 from october 1 effective in the fourth quarter of 2009 to better align with the completion of our annual budgeting process testing for impairment of goodwill is a twostep process the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach as this combination is considered the most indicative of the reporting units’ fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants under the income approach we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit discounted by an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn under the market approach we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for peer group companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company we have weighted the income approach and the market approach at 75 and 25 respectively 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit and the allocation of that fair value to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the event a step two analysis is required is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include primarily but are not limited to discount rate terminal growth rate selection of appropriate peer group companies and control premium applied and forecasts of revenue growth rates gross margins operating margins and working capital requirements the allocation requires analysis to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including among others customer relationships trade names and property and equipment any changes in the judgments estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results although we believe our assumptions are reasonable actual results may vary significantly and may expose us to material impairment charges in the future 

  

intangible assets include customer relationships trade names internally developed software and other intangibles intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the software these intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we record an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we take into consideration historical loss experience the overall quality of the receivable portfolio and specifically identified customer risks if actual collections of customer receivables differ from our estimates additional allowances may be required which could have an impact on our results of operations 

income taxes 

deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis this evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 

we account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

recent accounting pronouncements 

subsequent events 

in february 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued amendments to authoritative guidance on subsequent events the amended guidance requires that companies that file with the sec “sec filer” evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued the update also removed the requirement for an sec filer to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements this guidance was prospectively effective upon issuance the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

fair value measurements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued authoritative guidance to amend and expand the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements the guidance requires new disclosures about transfers in and transfers out of levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements and presentation of the activities within level 3 fair value measurements presented gross in a roll forward of activity the guidance also clarifies existing disclosures about the level of disaggregation of fair value for each class of assets and liabilities and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value except for the disclosures in the roll forward of activity in level 3 fair value measurements this guidance was effective for us as of january 1 2010 because it only requires additional disclosure the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows the disclosures in the roll forward of activity in level 3 fair value measurements will become effective for us as of january 1 2011 as this guidance also only requires additional disclosure the adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

revenue arrangements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued amendments to authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements the amended guidance amends the criteria for separating consideration in multipledeliverable arrangements establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable eliminates the residual method of allocation and expands the disclosures related to multipledeliverable revenue arrangements the amended guidance also modifies the scope of authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements to exclude from its requirements 1 nonsoftware components of tangible products and 2 software components of tangible products that are sold licensed or leased with tangible 

  

products when the software components and nonsoftware components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality the amended guidance will become effective for us beginning january 1 2011 we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

subsequent events 

on february 22 2011 we announced that we have commenced a cash tender offer the “offer” to purchase any and all of the outstanding 12070 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured debt in connection with the offer we are seeking from the holders of the senior unsecured debt consents to certain proposed amendments to the indenture for the senior unsecured debt that would eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default contained in the indenture governing the senior unsecured debt 

on february 23 2011 we announced that we are pursuing a proposed repricing of the 11461 million principal amount of the extended term loan to take advantage of lower interest rates currently available in the senior secured debt market the proposed amendment to the extended term loan is subject to lender consent and other conditions and may not occur as described or at all 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risks 

our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates the interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and our senior secured term loan facility are floating and therefore are subject to fluctuations in order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility we have entered into interest rate derivative agreements to hedge a portion of the cash flows associated with the facility our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

as of december 31 2010 we had two interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 20000 million that effectively converted the outstanding principal amount under the senior secured term loan facility from a floatingrate debt to a fixedrate debt under the first swap agreement a monthly net settlement is made for the difference between the fixed rate of 4155 per annum and the floating rate based on onemonth libor on the 15000 million notional amount of the swap under the second swap agreement a monthly net settlement is made for the difference between the fixed rate of 39125 per annum and the floating rate based on onemonth libor on the 5000 million notional amount both swap agreements terminate on january 14 2011 at december 31 2010 we were in a liability position for both of the interest rate swaps noted above the aggregate fair value of which was 28 million 

in april 2010 we entered into four forwardstarting interest rate cap agreements for the purpose of limiting future exposure to interest rate risk on our floatingrate debt under the senior secured term loan facility under these agreements we made premium payments totaling 59 million to the counterparties in exchange for the right to receive payments from them of the amount if any by which threemonth libor exceeds 35 during the agreement period the cap agreements are effective from january 14 2011 through january 14 2013 and have a total notional value of 11000 million

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

introduction 

this compensation discussion and analysis provides an overview of the company’s executive compensation philosophy and the material elements of compensation earned by our named executive officers with respect to 2010 

our named executive officers consist of our chief executive officer our chief financial officer and our three other most highly compensated executive officers for 2010 these named executive officers are 

 

  

  

  

  

 on october 12 2007 we were acquired by a company controlled by investment funds affiliated with the equity sponsors and we ceased at that time being a public company subject to sec and stock exchange listing rules the “acquisition” following the acquisition the compensation committees of cdw holdings our ultimate parent company and cdw llc collectively have responsibility for determining the compensation of our named executive officers the two compensation committees are comprised of the same members each of whom was appointed by the equity sponsors for purposes of this compensation discussion and analysis these two compensation committees are collectively referred to as the “committee” 

in 2010 the company registered public debt with the sec again subjecting the company to certain sec rules and disclosure requirements 

establishing and evaluating executive compensation 

executive compensation philosophy and objectives 

the committee believes that the company’s executive compensation programs should reward actions and behaviors that drive longterm profitable revenue growth at abovemarket rates while also rewarding the achievement of shortterm performance goals the following objectives are grounded in a payforperformance philosophy and provide a framework for the company’s executive compensation programs 

 

  

  

 these objectives guided the decisions made by the committee with respect to 2010 executive compensation 

market comparisons 

since the acquisition the company has continued to utilize the peer group established prior to the acquisition historically each of the companies in the company’s peer group met one or more of the following criteria i operated in the same line of business as the company ii operated “close” to the company’s line of business iii operated in a businesstobusiness distribution environment or iv competed with the company for talent 

  

compensation data with respect to the peer group is compiled by aon hewitt a global human capital consulting and outsourcing firm to account for the differences in revenue size between the members of the peer group and the company the compensation data in the peer group analysis is statistically adjusted by aon hewitt on the basis of revenue this allows the committee to review the compensation data on a sizeadjusted basis the peer group considered by the committee in setting 2010 executive compensation consisted of the following companies 

 

 as our business model continued to evolve following the acquisition to that of a multibrand technology solutions provider the committee felt it appropriate to supplement the peer group with survey data from a technology industry survey of approximately 1000 companies for mr edwardson the peer group is the primary market data source given the availability of chief executive officer compensation data in public filings and the compensation survey data provides a supplemental viewpoint for the other named executive officers the peer group data and compensation survey data are weighted equally in the committee’s analysis of market pay practices for purposes of this compensation discussion and analysis the peer group data and compensation survey data are collectively referred to as “market data” 

historically amounts paid or awarded to the named executive officers have been based on individual and company performance and market data has been used by the committee to provide a perspective on executive compensation in order to evaluate the competitiveness and reasonableness of the company’s executive compensation program the committee compares base salary to the market 50th percentile and total target cash compensation and total compensation including longterm incentive opportunity to a market range of the 50th to 75th percentile the total cash compensation opportunity for an executive is generally set to provide above market median total cash compensation for performance above market growth rate expectations in conjunction with market data the committee also considers the executive’s overall responsibilities individual performance against company goals and leadership impact when establishing appropriate compensation levels 

role of executive officers 

the committee is responsible for all compensation decisions for our named executive officers the company’s chief executive officer john a edwardson annually reviews the performance of each executive officer and makes recommendations based on these reviews to the committee 

elements of compensation 

the company’s executive compensation program consists of the following elements 

 

  

  

  

 base salary 

base salaries are included in the company’s total compensation package to provide a portion of compensation in the form of fixed cash the committee generally sets base salaries for executives including the named executive officers below the market median of salaries for executives in similar positions and with similar responsibilities at companies included in the market data aligned with our compensation philosophy a large proportion of executives’ total target cash compensation is nonfixed or variable to provide a strong connection between pay and performance accordingly in 2010 mr edwardson’s base salary was 39 of his total target cash compensation and base salaries for the other named executive officers ranged from 28 to 42 of their total target cash compensation 

in light of the continuing uncertainty in the general market mr edwardson recommended that there be no increases to the base salaries from the levels established in 2009 for any of the named executive officers based on this recommendation none of the named executive officers received an increase in base salary for 2010 

  

annual cash incentive awards 

senior management incentive plan 

cdw provides its senior management with shortterm incentive compensation through its annual cash bonus program the senior management incentive plan “smip” shortterm compensation under smip is a significant component of an executive’s total target cash compensation opportunity in a given year 

as noted above the committee generally assesses an executive’s total target cash compensation for competitiveness and reasonableness against the market data the total cash compensation opportunity for an executive is generally set to provide above market median total cash compensation for performance above market growth rate expectations because the named executive officer base salary levels historically have been below the 50th percentile of the market data the committee has long relied on smip to provide a significant component of the named executive officer’s total target cash compensation for 2010 in light of the continued uncertainty in the general market the committee did not increase the smip target award levels from those set for 2009 for the named executive officers other than ms ziegler and ms leahy the committee approved an increase to ms ziegler’s smip target from 630000 to 700000 and ms leahy’s smip target from 365000 to 400000 to position their total target cash compensation more competitively in the market for 2010 mr edwardson’s smip target award represented 61 of his total target cash compensation and smip target awards for our other named executive officers ranged from 58 to 72 of their respective total target cash compensation 

in establishing annual performance goals under smip the committee undertakes a rigorous review and analysis to ensure that the performance goals correlate to above market performance factors considered by the committee in establishing the performance goals include projected market growth rates and the company’s market share gains productivity and investments 

the committee believed that a combination of adjusted ebitda and market share performance was the most meaningful measure of the company’s 2010 performance for its stakeholders because together they take into account not only the company’s absolute performance but also performance relative to the market see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further information regarding the calculation of adjusted ebitda 

for 2010 the committee set the annual adjusted ebitda performance goal at an aggressive level that required company performance to be above projected market growth rates additionally the threshold payout level was set so as to require the company to meet or exceed prior year adjusted ebitda results for any incentive payments to be made to senior management under smip the committee also included a market share factor as a mechanism to adjust payments under smip this design feature adjusts smip awards based on the company’s financial and operational success relative to market 

in operation therefore payment of awards under smip for performance during 2010 was guided by three principles 

 

  

  

 the smip payout curve had a payout range from 0 to 200 of each participant’s target smip award for performance between 931 and 125 of the adjusted ebitda goal with different levels of payout for increased or constantdecreased market share and no payout if the company failed to achieve 2009 adjusted ebitda performance the threshold target and maximum payout opportunities under the smip payout curve are set forth below 

 

  

  in 2010 the committee determined that the company had achieved 120 of its adjusted ebitda performance goal and the company’s market share grew resulting in a payout percentage of 190 of each named executive officer’s bonus target as indicated by these results the company performed well during 2010 although that success to some extent was a function of the overall economy’s recovery in 2010 as indicated by the company’s increase in market share the company’s financial and operational success was to a greater extent a direct result of the company’s ability to continue to effectively serve its customers and the company’s success in maintaining the cost structure and discipline that it instituted during the economic downturn 

  

the table below sets forth the smip payouts to each of the named executive officers based upon 2010 performance 

 

 longterm incentive program 

the equity sponsors believe that members of senior management should hold a personally significant interest in the equity of the company to align their interests and the interests of our stakeholders as described below the equity sponsors implemented their management investment philosophy by requiring members of senior management to invest in the company and by establishing a “profitsinterest program” “profitsinterest programs” are common practice in portfolio companies of private equity firms and allow participants to share in increases in the equity value of the company 

a units 

the equity sponsors’ investment in the company is held in the form of class a common units of cdw holdings “a units” each of our current named executive officers who was with the company at the time of the acquisition was required to invest in the company by purchasing a units with cash by exchanging shares of cdw stock for a units equivalent in value or on a deferred basis by deferring certain of their 2007 compensation into deferred a units 

b unit program 

the company granted class b common units of cdw holdings “b units” in 2007 to each of our current named executive officers who were with the company at the time of the acquisition the committee also has the authority to grant b units to new members of senior management and additional b units to current members of senior management the committee granted b units to mr richards and ms ziegler in connection with the commencement of their employment in 2009 and 2008 respectively in march 2010 the committee awarded mr edwardson and ms ziegler an additional 7660 b units and 1766 b units respectively in determining the size of the awards the committee considered market data and in the case of mr edwardson the fact that mr edwardson was not a participant in the restricted debt unit plan the other component of the company’s longterm incentive program 

under the terms of the b unit program the a units and b units share equally in any increase in the equity value of the company above a predefined value for the a units we refer to this predefined value as the “participation threshold” as the economy and general market conditions deteriorated significantly in 2008 and 2009 the value of the b units held by senior management under the company’s longterm incentive program was severely diminished in mid 2009 the committee began to consider various alternatives for restoring the effectiveness of the company’s longterm incentive program by providing key leaders with a more meaningful interest in and reward for driving the growth and longterm value of the company the committee’s goal was to retain critical talent and to motivate key leaders to drive the longterm success of the company in considering modifications to the longterm incentive program the committee reviewed each executive’s total target compensation including the overall longterm incentive opportunity compared to the market data see “establishing and evaluating executive compensation—market comparisons” for further information regarding the market data 

as a result of such review early in 2010 the committee recommended and the board approved amendments to the b unit program the amendments effectively eliminated the participation threshold so that the a units and b units now share equally in any increase in the equity value of the company because the purpose of the amendments was to drive future increases in the equity value of the company as part of the changes the board required that the vesting of all b units including those that had previously vested be reset so that all b units became subject to a new fiveyear vesting period commencing on january 1 2010 

the modification to the b unit program affected all current participants in the b unit program including all of the named executive officers for additional information about the deferred a units and b units granted to the named executive officers see the narrative accompanying the “grants of planbased awards table” the table entitled “2010 outstanding equity awards at fiscal yearend” and the “2010 units vested table” below 

  

rdu plan 

in connection with its review of the longterm incentive program the committee recommended and the board approved the establishment of a restricted debt unit plan the “rdu plan” which was designed to retain key leaders and focus them on driving the longterm success of the company the rdu plan is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan participants in the rdu plan were granted restricted debt units “rdus” in march 2010 that entitle the participant to a proportionate share of payments under the rdu plan determined by dividing the number of rdus held by the participant by 28500 which is the total number of rdus available under the rdu plan each rdu represents 1000 of face value of the company’s senior subordinated notes 

the rdus vest on a pro rata basis over the threeyear period commencing january 1 2012 through december 31 2014 the rdus are designed to track two components of the company’s senior subordinated notes a principal component and an interest component however the participants have no rights to the underlying debt the total amount of compensation available under the rdu plan is based on these two components the principal component credits the rdu plan with an amount equal to 285 million face value of the company’s senior subordinated notes the “debt pool” payment of the principal component under the rdu plan will be made to participants on october 12 2017 unless accelerated due to a sale of the company the interest component credits the rdu plan with amounts equal to the interest that would have been earned on the debt pool from march 10 2010 through maturity october 12 2017 these amounts will be paid to participants on the interest payment dates except that amounts for 2010 and 2011 are deferred until 2012 at the time the company implemented the rdu plan the company repurchased and retired 285 million principal amount of the senior subordinated notes the company purchased the debt at a discount to the face value which effectively reduced the overall cost of the rdu plan to the company 

there are currently 26 participants in the rdu plan including each of the named executive officers other than mr edwardson the table below sets forth the number of rdus received by each named executive officer in determining the size of the rdu awards the committee considered market data with respect to total target compensation and longterm incentive opportunity 

 

 for additional information regarding the operation of the rdu plan and the rdus granted to the named executive officers see the narrative accompanying the “2010 nonqualified deferred compensation” table and the “2010 potential payments upon termination or change in control” section 

severance benefits 

the company’s employment arrangements with each of the named executive officers provide for payments and other benefits in connection with certain qualifying terminations of employment with the company the committee believes that these arrangements i help secure the continued employment and dedication of the named executive officers ii enhance the company’s value to a potential acquirer because the named executive officers have noncompetition nonsolicitation and confidentiality provisions that apply after any termination of employment including after a change in control of the company and iii are important as a recruitment and retention device as many of the companies with which we compete for executive talent have similar agreements in place for their senior management 

additional information regarding the employment arrangements with each of the named executive officers including a quantification of benefits that would have been received by each named executive officer had his or her employment terminated on december 31 2010 is provided under “2010 potential payments upon termination or change in control” 

other benefits 

our named executive officers participate in the company’s corporatewide benefit programs our named executive officers are provided benefits that are generally commensurate with the benefits provided to all fulltime cdw coworkers which includes participation in the company’s qualified defined contribution plan consistent with the company’s performancebased culture the company does not offer a servicebased defined benefit pension plan or other similar benefits to its coworkers similarly the company does not provide nonqualified retirement programs or perquisites that are often provided at other companies to the named executive officers 

  

compensation committee report 

the cdw llc compensation committee together with the compensation committee of cdw holdings llc has responsibility for determining the compensation of our named executive officers the compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the compensation discussion and analysis with management and based on such review and discussion the compensation committee recommended to the board of directors of cdw corporation that the compensation discussion and analysis be included in cdw corporation’s annual report on form 10k and such other filings with the sec as may be appropriate

  2010 nonqualified deferred compensation 

the following table and accompanying narrative provides information regarding the company’s restricted debt unit plan the “rdu plan” and deferred unit program 

 

  

   

   rdu plan 

as noted in the compensation discussion and analysis in connection with its review of the longterm incentive program the committee recommended and the board approved the establishment of the rdu plan the rdu plan is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan participants in the rdu plan were granted rdus in march 2010 that entitle the participant to a proportionate share of payments under the rdu plan determined by dividing the number of rdus held by the participant by 28500 which is the total number of rdus available under the rdu plan each rdu represents 1000 of face value of the senior subordinated notes 

the rdus are designed to track two components of the company’s senior subordinated notes a principal component and an interest component however participants have no rights to the underlying debt the total amount of compensation available under the rdu plan is based on these two components the principal component credits the rdu plan with an amount equal to 285 million face value of the company’s senior subordinated notes the “debt pool” payment of the principal component under the rdu plan will be made to participants on october 12 2017 unless accelerated as discussed in the “2010 potential payments upon termination or change in control” section the interest component credits the rdu plan with amounts equal to the interest that would have been earned on the debt pool from march 10 2010 through maturity october 12 2017 payment of the interest component for the period from march 10 2010 through december 31 2011 will be made in january 2012 and payment of the interest component for periods starting after january 1 2012 will be paid to participants semiannually on april 15 and october 15 unless accelerated as discussed in the “2010 potential payments upon termination or change in control” section 

participants vest in the principal component during employment on a pro rata basis over the threeyear period commencing january 1 2012 through december 31 2014 unless accelerated as discussed in the “2010 potential payments upon termination or change in control” section participants vest in the interest component for the period from march 10 2010 through december 31 2011 if they remain employed by the company through december 31 2011 and vest in the interest component for periods starting after january 1 2012 as discussed in the “2010 potential payments upon termination or change in control” section 

the principal and interest accrued on unallocated rdus under the rdu plan as of december 31 2014 will be allocated to participants who are employed as of such date on a pro rata basis according to the number of rdus held by each such participant compared to the total debt pool unless accelerated as discussed in the “2010 potential payments upon termination or change in control” section any rdus allocated to participants on december 31 2014 will be fully vested such principal and interest components allocated to each participant shall be paid on october 12 2017 unless accelerated as discussed in the “2010 potential payments upon termination or change in control” section 

see “2010 potential payments upon termination or change in control” below for a discussion of the treatment of the rdus upon certain terminations of employment or a sale of the company 

  

deferred units 

as noted in the compensation discussion and analysis the equity sponsors believe that members of senior management should hold a personally significant interest in the equity of the company to align their interests and the interests of our stakeholders to implement this philosophy the equity sponsors required that each of the named executive officers who was with the company at the time of the acquisition purchase equity in the company in the form of a cash investment in a units andor defer a portion of their compensation earned in 2007 into deferred a units 

pursuant to deferred unit purchase agreements dated october 12 2007 mr eckrote and ms leahy elected to defer a portion of compensation earned in 2007 into deferred a units to satisfy a portion of the management investment requirement implemented by the equity sponsors the deferred a units became fully vested as of december 31 2007 in addition mr eckrote also converted his deferred compensation account under the company’s prior nonqualified deferred compensation plan to deferred a units which were fully vested on october 12 2007 

the company established separate notional accounts for mr eckrote and ms leahy with respect to their deferred units pursuant to the terms of the deferred unit purchase agreements the deferred units were settled on october 12 2010 upon the settlement date mr eckrote and ms leahy received a units equivalent in value to the settled deferred units 

2010 potential payments upon termination or change in control

compensation protection agreements 

with respect to the named executive officers other than mr edwardson the company has entered into compensation protection agreements with each named executive officer that provide for payments and other benefits upon a qualifying termination of the named executive officer a qualifying termination means termination of the named executive officer’s employment 1 by the company other than a for “cause” b the named executive officer’s death or c the named executive officer’s disability or 2 by the named executive officer for “good reason” 

if the employment of a named executive officer other than mr edwardson is terminated for any reason other than a qualifying termination of employment the named executive officer is entitled to receive his or her “accrued obligations” under the terms of the compensation protection agreement accrued obligations include the following 1 accrued and unpaid base salary 2 any smip bonus deferred compensation and other cash compensation accrued by the named executive officer to the extent not paid as of the date of termination and 3 and vacation pay expense reimbursements and other cash entitlements accrued by the named executive officer to the extent not paid as of the date of termination

if the payments and benefits to a named executive officer under their respective employment agreement or compensation protection agreement would subject the named executive officer to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the internal revenue code the named executive officer would be entitled to receive a “grossup” payment unless the named executive officer’s net aftertax benefit resulting from such grossup payment as compared to a reduction of such payments and benefits so that no excise tax is incurred is less than 100000 the foregoing grossup payment is applicable only in the case of the company’s first change in control following its initial public offering 

rdu plan 

as noted in the compensation discussion and analysis and narrative to the “2010 nonqualified deferred compensation” table in 2010 the company established the rdu plan upon a qualifying termination of employment under the compensation protection agreements the participant will vest in the rdus through the date of termination determined as if the vesting schedule had been five year daily commencing on january 1 2010 in the event of the participant’s death or disability the participant will vest in an additional 20 of the rdus ie one year of vesting on a five year daily vesting schedule with respect to the interest component of the rdu plan upon a termination of employment a participant receives interest payments payable at the same time and same rate as other rdu participants with respect to vested and unvested rdus through the date of termination and with respect to vested rdus thereafter however if such termination occurs prior to december 31 2011 a participant forfeits all interest accrued under the rdu plan unless such termination is a qualifying termination of employment or a termination of employment due to death or disability in which case the participant receives interest payments payable at the same time and same rate as other rdu participants with respect to vested and unvested rdus through the date of termination and with respect to vested rdus thereafter 

  

all outstanding rdus become vested upon a sale of the company and participants will receive unpaid interest through the date of such sale of the company in addition upon a sale of the company the company is required to pay the same change in control payment equal to 1 of the debt pool as it would be required to pay noteholders under its senior subordinated exchange note indenture the change in control payment as well as the principal and interest portion of the debt pool not yet allocated as of the date of the sale of the company will be allocated to participants who are employed as of such date on a pro rata basis according to the number of rdus held by each participant compared to the total debt pool 

under the terms of the rdu plan upon a termination for “cause” as defined under the compensation protection agreements or a participant’s violation of a restrictive covenant between the participant and the company within three years after the participant’s termination of employment the participant will forfeit all vested rdus including future interest with respect to such rdus and payments made to the participant after his or her termination of employment and during the 24month period preceding the participant’s termination of employment are recoverable by the company 

b units 

all outstanding unvested b units would immediately vest upon a sale of the company under the class b common unit grant agreements entered into with each named executive officer all estimates in this section assume that all outstanding b units become vested upon the change in control 

for purposes of the rdu plan and b unit program a sale of the company means the acquisition by any person or group of 1 at least 51 of the equity securities of the company entitled to vote to elect members of the board or 2 all or substantially all of the company’s assets determined on a consolidated basis an initial public offering does not constitute a sale of the company
