our principal executive office is located in kirkland washington we have over 2700 employees worldwide with locations in asia primarily in china india japan south korea singapore and taiwan europe primarily in france germany hungary italy spain switzerland and the united kingdom and the united states

 

industry overview 

 

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or integrated circuits “ics” in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world to digital systems

 

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for high performance analog and mixedsignal ics high performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixedsignal ic markets from digital ic markets these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technologies importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer aboveaverage growth over the long term compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole

 

end markets and applications 

 

we design and develop our products for the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets with the computing and storage market representing the largest portion of our revenue in 2021 the following table is a summary of the various end market applications for our products and those markets’ contribution as a percentage of our total revenue

 

  

 

product families 

 

our proprietary process technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller singlechip power management ics these technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of analog applications within the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets our product families are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions our key product families include the following

 

direct current  “ dc ”  to dc products dc to dc ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers and notebooks monitors infotainment applications and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc products are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current high switching speed and small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices the dc to dc product family accounted for 95 95 and 94 of our total revenue in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

 

lighting control products lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in computers and notebooks monitors car navigation systems and televisions backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps the lighting control product family accounted for 5 5 and 6 of our total revenue in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

 

in the future we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families as well as in new innovative product categories our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of china taiwan and other asian markets expand our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity

 

customers sales and marketing 

 

we sell our products through thirdparty distributors valueadded resellers and directly to original equipment manufacturers “oems” original design manufacturers “odms” electronic manufacturing service “ems” providers and other end customers our thirdparty distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributors to sell our products to end customers and other resellers including oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers 

 

sales to our largest distributor accounted for 26 of our total revenue in 2021 24 in 2020 and 23 in 2019 in addition two distributors accounted for 15 and 10 of our total revenue in 2021 and one distributor accounted for 11 of our total revenue in 2020 no other distributors or end customers accounted for more than 10 of our fullyear total revenue in any of the periods presented

 

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor has the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 90 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements

 

we have sales offices in china india japan south korea singapore taiwan the united states and throughout europe our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems’ electronics containing our products

 

because our sales are primarily billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because a majority of our revenue is attributable to sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products in 2021 2020 and 2019 our revenue from sales to customers in asia was 90 91 and 89 respectively

 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped because orders in backlog are subject to cancellation or postponement and backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue

 

 

our manufacturing lead times are generally 16 to 26 weeks recently we have experienced high customer demand which has resulted in longer than usual lead times we often build inventory in advance based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount take a significant writedown or dispose of it altogether all of which would negatively affect our profit margins in addition in response to market conditions we may slow the rate of manufacturing our products which could result in insufficient inventory levels if we underestimate the demand for our products

 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term

 

research and development 

 

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers primarily in china germany spain switzerland taiwan and the united states with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies

 

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technologies in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products in the area of process technologies we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technologies are key strategic components to our future growth 

 

patents and intellectual property matters 

 

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies

 

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of december 31 2021 we had 1438 patentsapplications issued or pending of which 503 patents have been issued in the united states our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2041 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims such litigation can be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers or could pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products are found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows

 

 

manufacturing 

 

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ics this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technologies and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their equipment in their facilities for use on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our ics

 

we currently contract with several suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china taiwan and south korea once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort which is a testing process performed to identify nonfunctioning dies our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in china and malaysia the assembled ics are then sent either for final testing at our chengdu facility or to other turnkey providers who perform final testing based on our standards prior to shipping to our customers

our manufacturing facilities in chengdu china enable us to benefit from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs we have expanded our product testing capabilities in these facilities and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations

competition 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing average selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and in some cases have a broader number of product offerings that may enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with several manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices infineon technologies nxp semiconductors on semiconductor power integrations renesas electronics rohm semiconductor semtech and texas instruments

 

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however there is no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market in addition there has recently been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry if these or future acquisitions are successful competition may intensify and our competitors may have additional resources to compete against us

 

seasonality 

 

our revenue and operating results tend to vary seasonally historically our revenue has generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half although various factors such as market conditions and the timing of key product introductions could impact this trend

 

government regulations 

 

we are subject to international federal and local legislation regulations and other requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment the treatment transport and disposal of hazardous wastes recycling and product packaging worker health and safety and other activities affecting the environment our workforce and the management of our manufacturing operations we believe that our operations and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws

 

we are also subject to importexport controls tariffs and other traderelated regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business in recent years these controls tariffs regulations and restrictions have had and we believe may continue to have a material impact on our business including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components

 

 

government regulations can be complex and are subject to change in the future and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements our efforts to comply with these government regulations could have material impacts on our capital expenditures and operating expenses revenue resource allocation competitive position or financial condition though the magnitude and duration of such impacts are uncertain and difficult to quantify refer to “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion of material risks related to government policies and regulations on environmental laws international trade policies and restrictions including tariffs on imports of foreign goods and regulations restricting the export of goods and services between the us and china

 

human capital 

 

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have many years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business our future success depends in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike as of december 31 2021 we employed 2773 employees primarily located in asia europe and the united states compared with 2209 employees as of december 31 2020

 

competition for talent in the semiconductor industry is strong and compensation is critical to our recruiting and retention philosophy especially given our rapid growth and our need to attract talented employees with a broad range of skills our total compensation packages are competitive fair and structured to encourage employees to invest in our future our employee benefits programs include a combination of supplemental benefits including paid time off for holidays and vacations health insurance and other plan benefits

 

we are an equalopportunity employer and we make employment decisions based on merit and business needs we are committed to providing a healthy and safe environment for all our workers our worker health and safety plan is certified to iso 45001 standards the world’s voluntary international standard for occupational health and safety we believe that certifying to these standards enables our company to provide safe and healthy workplaces by preventing workrelated injury and health issues

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business involves numerous risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the sec in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements

 

risk factors summary 

 

the following summary description sets forth an overview of the material risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities the summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full risk factor discussion immediately following this summary description we encourage you to read the full risk factor discussion carefully

 

our revenue and expenses are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control as a result we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis our business results of operations and financial condition as well as your investment in our common stock could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following material risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

risks associated with our significant operations in asia particularly in china 

 

our business has been and may be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions in particular changing economic conditions in china 

 

in recent years global credit and financial markets experienced disruptions and may experience disruptions in the future including diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability economic uncertainty affects businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish liquidity and capital availability

 

demand for our products is a function of the health of the economies in the united states europe china and the rest of asia we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic disruptions such as those resulting from the covid19 pandemic or subsequent economic recovery worldwide in our industry or in the different markets that we serve we also may not accurately assess the impact of changing market and economic conditions on our business and operations these and other economic factors have had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results

 

in particular since we have significant operations in china our business development plans results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by significant political social and economic developments in china a slowdown in economic growth in china could adversely impact our customers prospective customers suppliers distributors and partners in china which could have a material adverse effect on our results of the operations and financial condition there is no guarantee that economic downturns whether actual or perceived any further decrease in economic growth rates or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook in china will not occur or persist in the future that they will not be protracted or that governments will respond adequately to control and reverse such conditions any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

 

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct sales or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and valueadded reseller agreements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2021 90 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

we and our manufacturing partners and suppliers are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners and suppliers receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

 

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china and most of our manufacturing partners and suppliers are located in china the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china additionally the chinese government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies

 

any additional new regulations or the amendment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners and suppliers to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results

 

the chinese government and provincial and local governments also have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners suppliers and us with respect to our facilities in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

uncertainties with respect to china ’ s legal system including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and sudden or unexpected changes in policies laws and regulations in china could adversely affect our operations 

 

china’s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes unlike the common law system prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value since china’s legal system continues to rapidly evolve the interpretations and enforcement of these laws and regulations are not always uniform and involve uncertainties in addition any new or amended laws and regulations related to among other things foreign investment and manufacturing could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to operate our business in china

 

from time to time we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights any administrative and court proceedings in china may be protracted resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention since china’s administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection than those that may be provided in other jurisdictions these uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce contracts in china and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations

 

furthermore china’s legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and may have retroactive effect as a result we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation may have occurred such unpredictability towards our contractual property and procedural rights and any failure to quickly respond to changes in the regulatory environment in china could adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations and proceed with our future business plans in china

 

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing and testing facilities in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

 

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china we face the following risks among others with respect to our operations in china

 

  

  

  

if we are unable to maintain our facilities in china at fully operational status with qualified workers appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected

 

 

we are subject to export laws trade policies and restrictions including international tariffs that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

as a global company headquartered in the united states we are subject to us laws and regulations that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially limited our operations or our sales but could materially limit them in the future which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations we maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities we must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition us laws and regulations and sanctions or threat of sanctions that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services to our customers may also encourage our customers to develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

since the beginning of 2018 there has been increasing rhetoric in some cases coupled with legislative or executive action from several us and foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials more specifically there have been several rounds of us tariffs on chinese goods that have taken effect in the past few years some of which prompted retaliatory chinese tariffs on us goods the institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the us and china specifically carries the risk of negatively affecting both countries’ overall economic condition if these tariffs continue or additional new tariffs are imposed in the future they could have a negative impact on us as we have significant operations in china and the us

 

we face political and other risks conducting business in taiwan and hong kong particularly due to their tense relationships with china 

 

we have significant business operations in taiwan and many of our manufacturing partners and suppliers are located in taiwan accordingly our business financial condition and results of operations may be affected by changes in governmental and economic policies in taiwan social instability and diplomatic and social developments in or affecting taiwan due to its unique international political status although significant economic and cultural relations have been established between taiwan and china we cannot assure that relations between taiwan and china will not face political or economic uncertainties in the future any deterioration in the relations between taiwan and china and other factors affecting military political or economic conditions in taiwan could disrupt our business operations and materially and adversely affect our results of operations

 

recently the chinese government has promulgated new regulations impacting economic and political stability within hong kong where many of our customers are located due to the sensitive political climate these regulations created there are increasing risks that the national security law may trigger sanctions or other forms of restrictions by foreign governments including the us which could affect companies conducting business in hong kong it is difficult for us to predict the impact if any the implementation of the national security law will have on our business as such impact will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted

 

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the renminbi may adversely affect results of operations 

 

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future if the value of the renminbi rises against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition our sales are primarily denominated in the us dollar if the value of the us dollar rises against other currencies it may adversely affect the demand for our products in international markets which could negatively impact our business and results of operations

 

we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the timing of payments for intercompany transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries mainly in china as well as transactions with vendors that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the amount of foreign currency exchange losses we record which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations

 

risks associated with product demand and sales 

 

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

 

in the past our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products we are subject to numerous risks and factors that could cause a decrease in our growth rates compared to past periods including increased competition loss of certain of our customers unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand a deterioration in market conditions endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and litigation a material decrease in our growth rates could adversely affect our stock price and results of operations 

 

 

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

 

we believe that the application of our products in the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the requirement to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected

 

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

 

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast all of which may be exacerbated by the adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

 

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above industry averages should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

 

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors

 

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets

 

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including

 

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

  

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

we depend on a limited number of customers including distributors for a significant percentage of our revenue 

 

historically we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers including distributors for example sales to our largest distributor accounted for 26 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenue the loss of any of these customers a decrease in demand or significant pricing pressure for our products from any of our major customers for any reason including due to competition market conditions catastrophic events or otherwise could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements valueadded resellers and direct customers and the loss of any one of these distributors valueadded resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

 

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and ems providers receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible sales to our largest distributor accounted for 26 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 and 26 of our total accounts receivable as of december 31 2021 significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results

 

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an end customer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or an oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our products must meet specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

 

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet ics as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or changes in the raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail from time to time we have experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is generally one to two years which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results

 

in addition product liability claims may be asserted by our customers although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage or that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage our insurance providers could deny or challenge these claims and as a result reimbursement to us is not guaranteed or could be delayed if coverage is denied we may not have sufficient resources to pay for these claims furthermore due to recent changes in the insurance industry we may experience a significant increase in premiums and therefore decide to selfinsure which may not meet the expectations or requirements of certain customers all of these factors could have a material and adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

 

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures may be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it generally takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons including

 

  

  

  

  

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

 

risks associated with supply and manufacturing 

 

our ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

 

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  for example we believe the strong increase in industrywide demand for electronic equipment for remote work arrangements as a result of the covid19 pandemic has resulted and will continue to result in capacity shortages of our suppliers as a result this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations delays in increasing thirdparty manufacturing capacity may also limit our ability to meet customer demand

 

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to our thirdparty suppliers ’ manufacturing capacity 

 

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops and testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities both with our current suppliers and with new suppliers such activities are subject to a number of risks including

 

  

  

  

  

  

 

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty suppliers’ capacity if our manufacturing costs increase we may be required to raise the prices for our products to remain profitable which could result in a loss of customers

 

we currently depend on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers are acquired become insolvent or capacity constrained or are otherwise unable to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

 

we have supply arrangements with certain suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers be acquired or become insolvent or capacity constrained we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue

 

while certain aspects of our relationships with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of our relationships depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management of the supplier relationships our relationships could also be negatively impacted by changes in control or changes in the management team of the suppliers in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields and supply of our products the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

 

in addition adverse macroeconomic conditions such as inflationary pressures resulting from worldwide supply chain constraints and other factors could increase the prices we pay to our suppliers as a result of the increased costs we may be required to raise the prices of our products in order to remain profitable which could result in a loss of customers and reduced revenue

 

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

 

we do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as the covid19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions may materially impact our assembly suppliers’ ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

 

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from thirdparty manufacturers in advance of selling our products we place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the timeframe that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in addition a perceived negative trend in market conditions could lead us to decrease the manufacturing volume of our products to avoid excess inventory if we inaccurately assessed the market conditions for our products we would have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands resulting in lost potential revenue in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigation or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be written down or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

the price and availability of commodities eg gold copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

our products incorporate commodities such as gold copper and silicon an increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations

 

 

risks associated with industry dynamics and competition 

 

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has resulted in significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may again experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall any significant or prolonged downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

 

in recent years there has been a trend toward semiconductor industry consolidation we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to improve the leverage of growing research and development costs strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry or become unable to continue operations unless they find an acquirer or consolidate with another company in addition companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that semiconductor industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors of multiple products for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we may face competition from customers developing products internally 

 

our customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources some customers have traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of thirdparty sourcing for products as an alternative to inhouse development customers may in the future continue to increase their use of internally developed components they may also decide to develop or acquire components technologies or products that are similar to or that may be substituted for our products if our customers fail to accept our products as an alternative if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with many manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate

 

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition

 

risks associated with information technology and cybersecurity 

 

implementation of enhanced enterprise resource planning  “ erp ”  or other information technology systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations 

 

from time to time we may implement new erp software solutions or upgrade existing systems implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of system providers and internal business teams we may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes including system downtime causing interruptions in business operations in addition transitioning to these new systems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or any significant system failures could disrupt our operations and financial reporting which could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources financial condition or results of operations 

 

 

system security risks data protection or privacy breaches cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations andor harm our reputation and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue increase our expenses negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price 

 

experienced hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution financial reporting or other critical functions

 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data on our internal systems network and servers such as proprietary business and financial information and confidential data pertaining to our customers suppliers and business partners maintaining security of sensitive information on our networks and the protection features of our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy we devote significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data however these security measures cannot provide absolute security although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and solutions any destructive or intrusive breach could compromise our networks creating system disruptions or slowdowns and the information stored on our networks could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen the increase in remote working arrangements during the covid19 pandemic has also heightened our potential exposure to cyber attacks which could put the sensitive proprietary and financial information we store on our internal systems at risk if any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data our reputation and relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially harmed and we could be exposed to risks of litigation and possible significant liability

 

portions of our information technology “it” infrastructure may also experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and our remediation efforts may be expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales or a loss of customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation

 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information was to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation and substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we are subject to various us and international laws policies and other regulations regarding data protection 

 

personal privacy cyber security and data protection are becoming increasingly significant issues in china and other countries to address these issues the standing committee of the national people’s congress promulgated the cyber security law of the people’s republic of china the “cyber security law” which took effect on june 1 2017 the cyber security law sets forth various requirements relating to the collection use storage disclosure and security of data among other things on june 10 2021 the national people’s congress passed the data security law of the people’s republic of china the “data security law” which became effective on september 1 2021 the data security law is the first comprehensive data security legislation in china which becomes a key supplement to the cyber security law and aims to regulate a wide range of issues in relation to the collection storage processing use provision transaction and publication of any kind of data various chinese agencies are expected to issue additional regulations in the future to define these requirements more precisely for example the personal information protection law “pipl” took effect on november 1 2021 pipl is aimed at protecting and controlling the use and transfer of personal information in china given its recent passage there is significant uncertainty in how regulators will interpret and enforce the law but it contains provisions that allow substantial government oversight and include fines for failure to obtain required approval from china’s cyber and data protection regulators for crossborder personal informationrelated data transfers

 

 

effective may 25 2018 the european union “eu”  implemented the general data protection regulation “gdpr”  a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of current eu data protection law to noneuropean union entities that process or control the processing of the personal information of eu subjects the gdpr allows for the imposition of fines and corrective action on entities that improperly use or disclose the personal information of eu subjects including through a data security breach in addition an increasing number of states in the us are enacting laws containing similar requirements to gdpr for businesses handling personal information of its customers for example the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa”   effective on january 1 2020 and is expected to enact new or amend current laws in the future

 

these regulatory requirements may increase our costs of compliance any failure to fully comply with the cyber security law the data security law pipl gdpr ccpa and other laws and regulations could lead to significant fines and corrective actions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition data security breaches experienced by us could result in the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property public disclosure of sensitive commercial data and the exposure of personally identifiable information including sensitive personal information of our employees customers suppliers and others

 

risks associated with strategic investments and initiatives 

 

our success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

 

our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development we expect to continue investing heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and introduce new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability increased investments in research and development will increase our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results and we may not be able to reduce such expenses in a timely manner if we experience a downturn in sales also if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources we could see material adverse effects on our business financial condition and operating results

 

in addition if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase further if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire in addition acquisitions could result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders reduce our cash balances and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities which could adversely affect our business 

 

as part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities as a result of completing acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities such actions could impact our operating results and the price of our common stock 

 

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust or other policies laws or regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings

 

we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with

 

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

risks associated with financial reporting 

 

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

 

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision including the effects of the us tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 “2017 tax act” and the enactment of other tax laws we engage thirdparty tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which if material would result in us having to restate our financial statements restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations damage our reputation andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or by changes in tax laws such as the 2017 tax act regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items in addition we are subject to potential future examinations of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and tax authorities in various jurisdictions where we have business operations we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

 

our international operations subject us to potentially significant tax consequences which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we conduct our international operations through whollyowned subsidiaries branches and representative offices and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions such corporate structures are subject to complex transfer pricing and other local regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions the relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions if such a disagreement were to occur and our positions were not sustained we could be required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties resulting in higher effective tax rates reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations additionally our future worldwide tax rate and financial position may be affected by changes in the relevant tax laws interpretation of such tax laws or the influence of certain tax policy efforts including in the eu and the organization for economic cooperation and development

 

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting 

 

 

effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct our business and operating results could be harmed our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations andor have a negative impact on our reputation and the trading price of our common stock and could subject us to stockholder litigation in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

 

risks associated with regulatory compliance intellectual property protection and litigation 

 

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act the  “ fcpa ”  and the uk bribery act our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to the fcpa the uk bribery act and various anticorruption laws of other jurisdictions which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under these laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which place us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa or other anticorruption laws resulting in an elevated risk of potential violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by the us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

our business is subject to various governmental laws and regulations and compliance with these regulations may impact our revenue and cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations or obtain government licenses and approvals for our desired international trading activities or technology transfers we may be forced to recall products and cease their distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

 

our business is subject to various significant laws and other legal requirements imposed by the us and other countries we conduct business in including export control laws such as the export administration act the export administration regulations and other laws regulations and requirements governing international trade and technology transfer these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend sales to these customers which could negatively impact our results of operations we must conform the manufacture and distribution of our products to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in many countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products we could be required to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products are brought into compliance

 

environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations 

 

we are subject to various foreign federal state and local laws and regulations that govern the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of certain products such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate including various eu member countries and countries in asia there can be no assurance that similar laws and regulations will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs possible delays in delivering products and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future products if the costs were to become prohibitive

 

if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys ’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

 

 

from time to time we are a party to various legal proceedings if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be significant we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and end users could decide not to use our products and our products and our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings even if resolved favorably such proceedings can be very expensive and time consuming and may divert managements attention from other business operations

 

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publicly disclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

 

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in us incurring unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be materially and adversely affected

 

future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing and significant legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses we may have to cease production of certain products design around such technologies or pay royalty payments any of which could harm our financial condition and our business our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time and effort to these legal proceedings which could divert management’s attention from focusing on our operations which could adversely affect our business

 

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business 

 

risks associated with human capital management 

 

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could affect our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands of our business including design cycles our business could be harmed furthermore if we lose key personnel the search for a qualified replacement and the transition could interrupt our operations as the search could take us longer than expected and divert management resources and the newly hired employee could take longer than expected to effectively integrate into the team

 

 

if we fail to retain key employees in our sales applications finance and legal functions or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal positions maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal control that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales operations and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected

risks associated with ownership of our stock 

 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

 

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including

 

  

 

  

in addition the stock market often experiences substantial volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

 

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

 

short positions in our stock could have a substantial impact on the trading price of our stock 

 

historically there have been “short” positions in our common stock the anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of our stock by some institutions or individuals who engage in short sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline such stock price decreases could encourage further shortsales that could place additional downward pressure on our stock price this could lead to further increases in the existing short position in our common stock and cause volatility in our stock price the volatility of our stock may cause the value of a stockholder’s investment to decline rapidly additionally if our stock price declines it may be more difficult for us to raise capital and may have other adverse effects on our business

 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

 

we have a dividend program approved by our board of directors pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock the declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and on the return achieved by our stockholders

 

if we issue additional shares of stock in the future it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 

 

we may issue additional shares of common stock in the future in order to raise additional capital to fund our global operations or in connection with an acquisition we also issue restricted stock units “rsus” to employees which convert into shares of common stock upon vesting any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate dilution to our stockholders in addition the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may result in additional regulatory requirements such as stockholder approval

 

general risk factors 

 

the effects of global pandemics such as covid19 are highly unpredictable and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we face various risks related to epidemics and pandemics including the global outbreak of covid19 first identified in december 2019 since the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak as a pandemic in march 2020 it has resulted in significant disruptions and uncertainties in the global economy and in the financial markets while the covid19 pandemic did not have a material and adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition the ongoing effect of the pandemic on our future operational and financial performance will depend on numerous evolving developments including the duration and magnitude of the pandemic and the introduction of new variants and the impact on our customers employees suppliers and other partners all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict at this time a prolonged outbreak could negatively affect our business including

 

  

  

 

  

  

  

  

we have worked and will continue to work with our stakeholders including customers suppliers and employees to address the continuing impact of this global pandemic we continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our business supply chain and customers and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the pandemic including limitations imposed by governmental authorities on our ability to return to normal operating practices these effects alone or taken together could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations or financial condition

 

our worldwide operations are subject to political economic and health risks and natural disasters which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 

 

our offices in california and washington the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer suppliers our ic testing and manufacturing facilities a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia particularly in china such concentration increases the risk that earthquakes or other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics and pandemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations for example the covid19 pandemic has resulted in disruptions in our business operations and global economic activities any of these events may cause disruptions and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations

 

in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruptions systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations

overview 

 

we are a global company that provides highperformance semiconductorbased power electronics solutions incorporated in 1997 our three core strengths include deep systemlevel knowledge strong semiconductor design expertise and innovative proprietary semiconductor process and system integration technologies these combined strengths enable us to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energyefficient costeffective easytouse solutions for systems found in computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer applications our mission is to reduce total energy and material consumption in our customers’ systems with green practical and compact solutions we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energyefficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families as well as in new innovative product categories

 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products we are not immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term

 

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ics this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths

 

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up typical lead times for orders are generally 16 to 26 weeks recently we have experienced high customer demand which has resulted in longer than usual lead times these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult

 

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia where our products are incorporated into enduser products our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia was 90 91 and 89 for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter products which serve the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity

 

impact of covid19 on our business 

 

the covid19 pandemic has had and continues to have a significant impact around the world while governmental measures such as travelrelated restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business restrictions and shutdowns have begun to lift in recent months the impact of the pandemic on the global economy continues to remain uncertain

 

our primary focus is to continue to execute our business plan and mitigate the effect of the covid19 pandemic on our financial position and operations while actively taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our employees our suppliers and our customers the pandemic did not materially and adversely impact our overall operating results or business operations for the year ended december 31 2021 some of the key developments and initiatives we have implemented include but are not limited to the following

 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

we have worked and are continuing to actively work with our stakeholders including customers suppliers and employees to address the impact of the pandemic we will continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our business supply chain and customers and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences however we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy the semiconductor industry and our business a prolonged economic slowdown as a result of the pandemic or otherwise could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition for 2022 and beyond

 

cybersecurity risk management 

 

we are committed to protecting our it assets including computers systems corporate networks and sensitive data from unauthorized access or attack we have established an internal global it policy handbook as well as it security management control procedures designed to

 

  

we require all new employees to attend an it security training orientation in addition on an asneeded basis our it team provides trainings and updates to employees related to our policies and procedures

 

our it steering committee which consists of our senior management and it team meets on a regular basis to review initiatives and projects to improve it security as well as resources and budgets for our cybersecurity compliance and education efforts we completed the iso 27001 certification a globally recognized information security standard in 2021

 

our audit committee of the board of directors which consists of three independent members is responsible for the oversight of our cybersecurity risk program on a regular basis the audit committee reviews reports and updates from our chief financial officer and it senior management about major risk exposures their potential impact on our business operations and management’s strategies to assess monitor and mitigate those risks the audit committee also provides updates of their oversight and findings to the board of directors 

 

we believe we have adequate resources and sufficient policies procedures and oversight in place to identify and manage our it security risks to our business operations to date we do not believe we have experienced any material information security breaches and have not incurred significant operating expenses related to information security breaches

 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation inventories income taxes and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control including demand for our products economic conditions and other current and future events such as the impact of the covid19 pandemic actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements 

as of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance related to the covid19 pandemic that would require management to update the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  as new events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available any changes to these estimates and assumptions will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

 

revenue recognition  

 

we account for price adjustment and stock rotation rights as variable consideration that reduces the transaction price and recognize that reduction in the same period the associated revenue is recognized four usbased distributors have price adjustment rights when they sell our products to their end customers at a price that is lower than the distribution price invoiced by us when we receive claims from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers at the lower price we issue the distributors credit memos for the price adjustments we estimate the price adjustments using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical claims at both the distributor and product level as well as an assessment of any known trends of product sales mix 

 

certain distributors have limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases in accordance with the contract terms we estimate the stock rotation returns using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical returns and the current level of inventory in the distribution channel 

 

overall our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration have been materially consistent with actual results however these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results

 

inventory valuation 

 

inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost determined on a firstin firstout basis and estimated net realizable value we write down excess and obsolete inventories based on their age and forecasted demand which includes estimates taking into consideration our revenue forecast outlook on market and economic conditions technology changes new product introductions and changes in strategic direction if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required conversely if actual demand or market conditions are more favorable inventories may be sold that were previously written down 

 

accounting for income taxes  

 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made 

 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had a valuation allowance of 195 million and 182 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be fully realized in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax assets valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made

 

 

contingencies 

 

we record a contingent liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable based on the facts and circumstances in each matter the determination of such liability requires significant judgment in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations

 

stockbased compensation 

 

for equity awards with performance conditions as well as awards containing both market and performance conditions we recognize compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance goals will be achieved management performs the probability assessment on a quarterly basis by reviewing external factors such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry revenue forecasts and internal factors such as our business and operational objectives and revenue forecasts changes in the probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catchup adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date if the projected achievement was revised upward or if the actual results were higher than the projected achievement additional compensation expense would be recorded for the awards due to the cumulative catchup adjustment which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations conversely if the projected achievement was revised downward or if the actual results were lower than the projected achievement previously accrued compensation expense would be reversed for the awards which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations as a result our stockbased compensation expense is subject to volatility and may fluctuate significantly each quarter due to changes in our probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions or actual results being different from projections made by management

results of operations 

 

the following table summarizes our results of operations

 

  

revenue 

 

the following table summarizes our revenue by end market

 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 was 12078 million an increase of 3633 million or 430 from 8445 million for the year ended december 31 2020 overall unit shipments increased by 31 and average sales prices increased by approximately 8 compared to the same period in 2020 the increase in average sales prices was primarily driven by favorable changes in product mix with more sales coming from products with higher unit prices 

 

 

for the year ended december 31 2021 revenue from the computing and storage market increased 1191 million or 470 from the same period in 2020 this increase was primarily driven by strong sales growth for enterprise notebooks cloud computing and storage applications revenue from the automotive market increased 954 million or 875 from the same period in 2020 this increase was primarily driven by sales growth for highly integrated applications supporting the digital cockpit advanced driver assistance systems and connectivity revenue from the industrial market increased 652 million or 545 from the same period in 2020 this increase was broadbased with each of our primary product lines enjoying better than doubledigit revenue growth revenue from the communications market increased 218 million or 153 from the same period in 2020 the increase was primarily due to higher sales of products for infrastructure and wireless applications revenue from the consumer market increased 619 million or 281 from the same period in 2020 this increase was primarily driven by increased sales for home appliances and smart tvs

 

cost of revenue and gross margin  

 

cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred to manufacture assemble and test our products as well as warranty costs inventoryrelated and other overhead costs and stockbased compensation expenses 

 

  

cost of revenue was 5223 million or 432 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 and 3785 million or 448 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 the 1438 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 31 increase in overall unit shipments and a 6 increase in the average direct cost of units shipped the increase in cost of revenue was also driven by an increase in manufacturing overhead costs warranty expenses and inventory writedowns which was partially offset by a onetime benefit of 40 million from a litigation settlement

 

gross margin was 568 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with 552 for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in gross margin was mainly driven by a favorable product mix and a onetime benefit of 40 million from a litigation settlement as a percentage of revenue which was partially offset by higher warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue

 

research and development  “ rd ”  

 

rd expenses primarily consist of salary and benefit expenses bonuses stockbased compensation and deferred compensation for design and product engineers expenses related to new product development and supplies and facility costs 

 

  

rd expenses were 1906 million or 158 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 and 1376 million or 163 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 the 530 million increase in rd expenses was primarily due to an increase of 247 million in cash compensation expenses which include salary benefits and bonuses an increase of 64 million in new product development expenses and an increase of 60 million in stockbased compensation expenses which were mainly associated with performancebased equity awards our rd headcount was 1087 employees as of december 31 2021 compared with 930 employees as of december 31 2020 

 

 

selling general and administrative  “ sga ”  

 

sga expenses primarily include salary and benefit expenses bonuses stockbased compensation and deferred compensation for sales marketing and administrative personnel sales commissions travel expenses facilities costs and professional service fees 

 

  

sga expenses were 2262 million or 187 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 and 1617 million or 191 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 the 645 million increase in sga expenses was primarily due to an increase of 310 million in stockbased compensation expenses which were mainly associated with performancebased equity awards 242 million in cash compensation expenses which include salary benefits and bonuses and an increase of 41 million in commission expenses driven by higher revenue our sga headcount was 688 employees as of december 31 2021 compared with 564 employees as of december 31 2020 

 

litigation expense net 

 

litig ation expense was 62 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with 78 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the expense for both periods was attributable to litigation activity related to ongoing patent infringement and other matters 

 

other income net 

 

other income net was 98 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared with 105 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 10 million in realized gains from sales of investments which was partially offset by an increase of 06 million in net interest income

 

income tax expense 

 

the income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2021 was 302 million or 111 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in bermuda and china taxed at lower statutory tax rates the decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” tax

 

the income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2020 was 50 million or 29 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in bermuda and china taxed at lower statutory tax rates and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation the decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the gilti tax

 

the increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to lower excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and lower tax credits from rd activities the increase was partially offset by higher foreign income from our subsidiaries in bermuda and china taxed at lower statutory tax rates

 

see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  

 

as of december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1893 million and shortterm investments of 5358 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of 3349 million and shortterm investments of 2602 million as of december 31 2020 as of december 31 2021 1268 million of cash and cash equivalents and 3202 million of shortterm investments were held by our international subsidiaries for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we repatriated 700 million and 300 million respectively of cash from our bermuda subsidiary to the us the proceeds will primarily be used to fund our ongoing business operations we may repatriate additional cash from our bermuda subsidiary to fund our expenditures in future periods we anticipate that earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested

 

summary of cash flows  

 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2021 the 522 million increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior period was primarily due to an increase of 776 million in net income and an increase of 379 million in stockbased compensation expense partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities

 

for the year ended december 31 2021 the 3397 million increase in cash used in investing activities compared to the prior period was primarily due to a 2438 million decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of investments a 599 million increase in purchases of shortterm investments and a 388 million increase in capital expenditures

 

for the year ended december 31 2021 the 186 million increase in cash used in financing activities compared to the prior period was primarily due to a 206 million increase in dividend and dividend equivalent payments

 

 

 

in the future in order to strengthen our financial position respond to adverse developments changes in our circumstance or unforeseen events or conditions or fund our growth we may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities issuing debt or convertible debt securities incurring indebtedness secured by our assets or selling certain product lines andor portions of our business there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all

 

from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning capital investments and potential acquisitions of product lines technologies businesses and companies and we continue to consider potential investments and acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities assumptions of debt andor payment of cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such investments or acquisitions through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution

although consequences of any economic uncertainty and macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future and cash requirements may fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that our balances of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 7251 million as of december 31 2021 along with cash generated by ongoing operations will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months and beyond

 

our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations

 

purchase obligations 

 

purchase obligations represent our obligations with our suppliers and other parties that require the purchases of goods or services which primarily consist of wafer and other inventory purchases assembly and other manufacturing services construction of manufacturing and rd facilities purchases of production and other equipment and license arrangements as of december 31 2021 our total obligations were 1986 million of which approximately 1887 million was shortterm

 

transition tax liability 

 

the transition tax liability represents the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax imposed on previously deferred foreign earnings under the 2017 tax act as permitted by the 2017 tax act we have elected to pay the tax liability in installments on an interestfree basis through 2025 as of december 31 2021 the remaining liability totaled 168 million of which 20 million was shortterm

 

operating leases 

 

operating lease obligations represent the undiscounted remaining lease payments primarily for our leased facilities and equipment as of december 31 2021 these obligations totaled 58 million of which 25 million was shortterm

 

dividends 

 

we currently have a dividend program approved by our board of directors pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock based on our historical practice stockholders of record as of the last business day of the quarter are entitled to receive the quarterly cash dividends when and if declared by the board of directors which are payable to the stockholders in the following month as of december 31 2021 accrued dividends totaled 277 million the declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of the stockholders

 

in addition in february 2022 our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from 060 per share to 075 per share

 

other longterm obligations 

 

other longterm obligations primarily include payments for deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents as of december 31 2021 these obligations totaled 640 million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by management and approved by the audit committee of the board of directors such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities based on our investment positions as of december 31 2021 the impact of changes in interest rates on our interest income was immaterial

 

investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale which are reported at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets when the fair value of an investment is below its amortized cost basis unrealized losses due to changes in interest rates ie noncredit loss factors are not recognized in our results of operations unless we have the intent to sell the securities or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis based on our investment positions as of december 31 2021 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a 39 million decline in the fair value of our investments any losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity

 

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

our sales outside the united states are primarily transacted in us dollars through our subsidiary in bermuda accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes the functional currency of our offshore operations is generally the local currency primarily including the renminbi the new taiwan dollar and the euro we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain transactions including intercompany transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency gains or losses from the remeasurement and settlement of the balances are reported in other income net on the consolidated statements of operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations for all periods presented

business 

tableend  

general 

 

monolithic power systems “mps” is a leading semiconductor company that designs develops and markets highperformance power solutions incorporated in 1997 our core strengths include deep systemlevel and applications knowledge strong analog design expertise and innovative proprietary process technologies these combined strengths enable us to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energyefficient costeffective easytouse solutions for systems found in computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer applications our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers’ systems with green practical and compact solutions we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energyefficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families as well as in new innovative product categories

 

our principal executive office is located in kirkland washington we have over 2200 employees worldwide with locations in asia primarily in china india japan korea singapore and taiwan europe primarily in france germany spain switzerland and the united kingdom and the united states

 

industry overview 

 

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or integrated circuits “ics” in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world to digital systems

 

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for high performance analog and mixedsignal ics high performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixedsignal ic markets from digital ic markets these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technologies importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer aboveaverage growth over the long term compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole

  

end markets and applications 

 

we design and develop our products for the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets with the computing and storage market representing the largest portion of our revenue in 2020 the following table is a summary of the various end market applications for our products and those markets’ contribution as a percentage of our total revenue 

 

  

 

product families 

 

our proprietary process technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller singlechip power management ics these technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of analog applications within the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets our product families are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions our key product families include the following

 

direct current “dc” to dc products dc to dc ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers and notebooks monitors infotainment applications and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc products are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current high switching speed and small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices the dc to dc product family accounted for 95 94 and 92 of our total revenue in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively   

 

lighting control products lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in computers and notebooks monitors car navigation systems and televisions backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps the lighting control product family accounted for 5 6 and 8 of our total revenue in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

 

in the future we plan to continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as expand our newer product families our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of china taiwan and other asian markets expand our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity

 

customers sales and marketing 

 

we sell our products through thirdparty distributors valueadded resellers and directly to original equipment manufacturers “oems” original design manufacturers “odms” electronic manufacturing service “ems” providers and other end customers our thirdparty distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributors to sell our products to end customers and other resellers including oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers 

 

sales to our largest distributor accounted for 24 of our total revenue in 2020 23 in 2019 and 22 in 2018 in addition one other distributor accounted for 11 of our total revenue in 2020 and 10 in 2018 no other distributors or end customers accounted for more than 10 of our fullyear total revenue in any of the periods presented

 

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor has the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 90 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements

 

we have sales offices located in china india japan korea singapore taiwan the united states and throughout europe our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems’ electronics containing our products

 

because our sales are primarily billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because a majority of our revenue is attributable to sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products in 2020 2019 and 2018 our revenue from sales to customers in asia was 91 89 and 88 respectively

 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped because orders in backlog are subject to cancellation or postponement and backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue

 

 

our manufacturing lead times are generally 16 to 26 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount take a significant writedown or dispose of it altogether all of which would negatively affect our profit margins in addition in response to market conditions we may slow the rate of manufacturing our products which could result in insufficient inventory levels if we underestimate the demand for our products

 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term

 

research and development 

 

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers primarily in china spain taiwan and the united states with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies

 

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technologies in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products in the area of process technologies we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technologies are key strategic components to our future growth 

 

patents and intellectual property matters 

 

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies

 

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of december 31 2020 we had 1327 patentsapplications issued or pending of which 475 patents have been issued in the united states our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2039 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers or could pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products are found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows

 

 

manufacturing 

 

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ics this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technologies and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their equipment in their facilities for use on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our ics

 

we currently contract with several suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china taiwan and korea once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort which is a testing process performed to identify nonfunctioning dies our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in china and malaysia the assembled ics are then sent either for final testing at our chengdu facility or to other turnkey providers who perform final testing based on our standards prior to shipping to our customers

 

we have a 60000 squarefoot manufacturing facility located in chengdu china which enables us to benefit from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs we have expanded our product testing capabilities in this facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations

 

competition 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing average selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and in some cases have a broader number of product offerings that may enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with several manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices infineon technologies maxim integrated products nxp semiconductors on semiconductor power integrations renesas electronics rohm semiconductor semtech and texas instruments

 

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however there is no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market in addition there has recently been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry if these or future acquisitions are successful competition may intensify and our competitors may have additional resources to compete against us

 

seasonality 

 

our revenue and operating results tend to vary seasonally historically our revenue has generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half although various factors such as market conditions and the timing of key product introductions could impact this trend

  

government regulations 

 

we are subject to international federal and local legislation regulations and other requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment the treatment transport and disposal of hazardous wastes recycling and product packaging worker health and safety and other activities affecting the environment our workforce and the management of our manufacturing operations we believe that our operations and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws

 

 

we are also subject to importexport controls tariffs and other traderelated regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business in recent years these controls tariffs regulations and restrictions have had and we believe may continue to have a material impact on our business including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components

 

government regulations can be complex and are subject to change in the future and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements our efforts to comply with these government regulations could have material impacts on our capital expenditures and operating expenses resource allocation competitive position or financial condition though the magnitude and duration of such impacts are uncertain and difficult to quantify refer to “item 1a risk factors” for further discussion of material risks related to government policies and regulations on environmental laws international trade policies and restrictions including tariffs on imports of foreign goods and regulations restricting the export of goods and services between the us and china

  

  human capital 

 

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have many years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business our future success depends in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike as of december 31 2020 we employed 2209 employees primarily located in asia europe and the united states compared with 2002 employees as of december 31 2019

 

competition for talent in the semiconductor industry is strong and compensation is critical to our recruiting and retention philosophy especially given our rapid growth and our need to attract talented employees with a broad range of skills our total compensation packages are competitive fair and structured to encourage employees to invest in our future our employee benefits programs include a combination of supplemental benefits including paid time off for holidays and vacations health insurance and other plan benefits

 

we are an equalopportunity employer and we make employment decisions based on merit and business needs we are committed to providing a healthy and safe environment for all our workers our worker health and safety plan is certified to iso45001 standards the world’s voluntary international standard for occupational health and safety we believe that certifying to these standards enables our company to provide safe and healthy workplaces by preventing workrelated injury and health issues

the following summary description sets forth an overview of the material risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities the summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full risk factor discussion immediately following this summary description we encourage you to   read the full risk factor discussion carefully

 

our revenue and expenses are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control as a result we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis our business results of operations and financial condition as well as your investment in our common stock could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following material risks 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

risks associated with global pandemics on our business 

  

the effects of global pandemics such as covid19 could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we face various risks related to epidemics and pandemics including the global outbreak of covid19 first identified in december 2019 in march 2020 the world health organization characterized the covid19 outbreak as a pandemic since then governments around the world have imposed various mandatory measures and the private sectors have taken actions in an effort to combat the spread of the disease such as travel restrictions quarantines and business shutdowns in addition the us government has declared a state of emergency or similar disaster declaration and many states including washington and california where we have substantial operations have enacted shelterinplace or similar restrictive orders these events have led to significant disruptions and uncertainties in the global economy and in the financial markets which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations uncertainties regarding the economic impact of the pandemic is likely to result in sustained market turmoil and could adversely impact the semiconductor industry which could in turn negatively and materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations

 

the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on numerous evolving developments including the duration and magnitude of the pandemic and the effects on our customers employees suppliers and other partners all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict at this time a sustained or prolonged outbreak could exacerbate the adverse impact on our business which may include

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

we are working with our stakeholders including customers suppliers and employees to address the impact of this global pandemic we continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our business supply chain and customers and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences should such disruption continue for an extended period of time or if and when the pandemic ends the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the pandemic including limitations imposed by governmental authorities on our ability to return to normal operating practices these effects alone or taken together could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations or financial condition

 

risks associated with our significant operations in asia in particular china 

  

our business has been and may be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions in particular changing economic conditions in china 

 

in recent years global credit and financial markets experienced disruptions and may experience disruptions in the future including diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability economic uncertainty affects businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish liquidity and capital availability

 

demand for our products is a function of the health of the economies in the united states europe china and the rest of asia we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic disruptions such as those resulting from the covid19 pandemic or subsequent economic recovery worldwide in our industry or in the different markets that we serve we also may not accurately assess the impact of changing market and economic conditions on our business and operations these and other economic factors have had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results

 

in particular since we have significant operations in china our business development plans results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by significant political social and economic developments in china a slowdown in economic growth in china could adversely impact our customers prospective customers suppliers distributors and partners in china which could have a material adverse effect on our results of the operations and financial condition there is no guarantee that economic downturns whether actual or perceived any further decrease in economic growth rates or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook in china will not occur or persist in the future that they will not be protracted or that governments will respond adequately to control and reverse such conditions any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

 

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct sales or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and valueadded reseller agreements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2020 91 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

  

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

 

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china and most of our manufacturing partners are located in china the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china additionally china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies

 

personal privacy cyber security and data protection are becoming increasingly significant issues in china to address these issues the standing committee of the national people’s congress promulgated the cyber security law of the people’s republic of china the “cyber security law” which took effect on june 1 2017 the cyber security law sets forth various requirements relating to the collection use storage disclosure and security of data among other things various chinese agencies are expected to issue additional regulations in the future to define these requirements more precisely these requirements may increase our costs of compliance we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of these regulatory requirements   any failure to comply with the cyber security law and the relevant regulations and policies could result in further cost and liability to us and could adversely affect our business and results of operations additionally increased costs to comply with and other burdens imposed by the cyber security law and relevant regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our suppliers vendors and other service providers as well as our customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations

 

any additional new regulations or the amendment or modification of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results

 

the chinese government and provincial and local governments also have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facilities in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to us and our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

 

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing and testing facilities in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

 

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china we face the following risks among others with respect to our operations in china

 

  

  

  

if we are unable to maintain our facilities in china at fully operational status with qualified workers appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected

 

we are subject to export laws trade policies and restrictions including international tariffs that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

as a global company headquartered in the united states we are subject to us laws and regulations that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially limited our operations or our sales but could materially limit them in the future which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations we maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities we must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition us laws and regulations and sanctions or threat of sanctions that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services to our customers may also encourage our customers to develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

since the beginning of 2018 there has been increasing rhetoric in some cases coupled with legislative or executive action from several us and foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials more specifically there have been several rounds of us tariffs on chinese goods taking effect in the past few years some of which prompted retaliatory chinese tariffs on us goods the institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the us and china specifically carries the risk of negatively affecting both countries’ overall economic condition if these tariffs continue or additional new tariffs are imposed in the future they could have a negative impact on us as we have significant operations in china and the us

 

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the renminbi may adversely affect results of operations 

 

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future if the value of the renminbi rises against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition our sales are primarily denominated in the us dollar if the value of the us dollar rises against other currencies it may adversely affect the demand for our products in international markets which could negatively impact our business and results of operations

 

 

we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the timing of payments for transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries which are reported in interest and other income in the statements of operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the amount of foreign currency exchange losses we record which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations

 

risks associated with product demand and sales 

  

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

 

in the past our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products we are subject to numerous risks and factors that could cause a decrease in our growth rates compared to past periods including increased competition loss of certain of our customers unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand a deterioration in market conditions endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and litigation a material decrease in our growth rates could adversely affect our stock price and results of operations   

 

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

 

we believe that the application of our products in the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected

 

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

 

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast all of which may be exacerbated by the adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

 

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above industry averages should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

 

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors

 

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets

 

 

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

we depend on a limited number of customers including distributors for a significant percentage of our revenue 

 

historically we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers including distributors for example sales to our largest distributor accounted for 24 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenue a decrease in demand or significant pricing pressure for our products from any of our major customers for any reason including due to competition market conditions catastrophic events or otherwise could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements valueadded resellers and direct customers and the loss of any one of these distributors valueadded resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

 

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and ems providers receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible sales to our largest distributor accounted for 24 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply commitments 

 

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an end customer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or an oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

 

our products must meet specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

 

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet ics as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is generally one to two years which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results

 

in addition product liability claims may be asserted by our customers with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage or that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage our insurance providers could deny or challenge these claims and as a result reimbursement to us is not guaranteed or could be delayed if coverage is denied we may not have sufficient resources to pay for these claims furthermore due to recent changes in the insurance industry we may experience a significant increase in premiums and therefore decide to selfinsure which may not meet the expectations or requirements of certain customers all of these factors could have a material and adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

 

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures may be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it generally takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons including

 

  

  

  

  

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

 

risks associated with supply and manufacturing 

 

our ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

 

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  for example we believe the strong increase in industrywide demand for electronic equipment for remote work arrangements as a result of the covid19 pandemic has resulted and will continue to result in capacity shortages of our suppliers as a result this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline we may also be required to increase the prices of our products in order to remain profitable which could result in a loss of customers in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations delays in increasing thirdparty manufacturing capacity may also limit our ability to meet customer demand

 

 

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our thirdparty suppliers’ manufacturing capacity 

 

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops and testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities such activities are subject to a number of risks including

 

  

  

  

  

  

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty suppliers’ capacity if our manufacturing costs increase we may be required to raise the prices for our products to remain profitable which could result in a loss of customers

  

we currently depend on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers are acquired become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

 

we have a supply arrangement with certain suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers are acquired or become insolvent or capacity constrained we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue

 

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management of the supplier relationships our relationships could also be negatively impacted by changes in control or changes in the management team of the suppliers in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

 

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

 

we do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as global economic crises and the covid19 pandemic may materially impact our assembly suppliers’ ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

 

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from thirdparty manufacturers in advance of selling our products we place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the timeframe that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in addition a perceived negative trend in market condition could lead us to decrease the manufacturing volume of our products to avoid excess inventory if we inaccurately assessed the market conditions for our products we would have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigation or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be written down or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

the price and availability of commodities eg gold copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

our products incorporate commodities such as gold copper and silicon an increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations

  

risks associated with industry dynamics and competition 

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall any significant or prolonged downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

  

in recent years there has been a trend toward semiconductor industry consolidation we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to improve the leverage of growing research and development costs strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry or become unable to continue operations unless they find an acquirer or consolidate with another company in addition companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that semiconductor industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

  

we may face competition from customers developing products internally 

  

our customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources some customers have traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of thirdparty sourcing for products as an alternative to inhouse development customers may in the future continue to use internally developed components they may also decide to develop or acquire components technologies or products that are similar to or that may be substituted for our products if our customers fail to accept our products as an alternative if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with many manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate 

 

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition

 

 

risks associated with information technology and cybersecurity 

  

implementation of an enterprise resource planning “erp” or other information technology systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations 

 

from time to time we may implement new erp software solutions or upgrade existing systems implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of system providers and internal business teams we may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes including system downtime causing interruptions in business operations in addition transitioning to these new systems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or any significant system failures could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources financial condition or results of operations 

 

system security risks data protection or privacy breaches cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations andor harm our reputation and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue increase our expenses negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price 

 

experienced hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution financial reporting or other critical functions

 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data on our internal systems network and servers such as proprietary business and financial information and confidential data pertaining to our customers suppliers and business partners the secure maintenance of sensitive information on our networks and the protection features of our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy we devote significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data however these security measures cannot provide absolute security although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and solutions any destructive or intrusive breach could compromise our networks creating system disruptions or slowdowns and the information stored on our networks could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen the increase in remote working arrangements during the covid19 pandemic has also heightened our potential exposure to cyber attacks which could put the sensitive proprietary and financial information we store on our internal systems at risk if any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data our relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially damaged our reputation could be materially harmed and we could be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible significant liability

 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and our remediation efforts may be expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation

 

effective may 25 2018 the european union  “ eu ” implemented the general data protection regulation  “ gdpr ” a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of current eu data protection law to noneuropean union entities that process or control the processing of the personal information of eu subjects the gdpr allows for the imposition of fines and corrective action on entities that improperly use or disclose the personal information of eu subjects including through a data security breach the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act of 2018  “ ccpa ”  effective on january 1 2020 which contains requirements similar to gdpr for the handling of personal information of california residents

 

our failure to fully comply with gdpr ccpa and other laws could lead to significant fines and require onerous corrective action in addition data security breaches experienced by us could result in the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property public disclosure of sensitive commercial data and the exposure of personally identifiable information including sensitive personal information of our employees customers suppliers and others

 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information was to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

risks associated with strategic investments and initiatives 

  

our success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

 

our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development we expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and introduce new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability if we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results also if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources we could see material adverse effects on our business financial condition and operating results

 

in addition if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development

  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire in addition acquisitions could result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders reduce our cash balances and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities which could adversely affect our business 

 

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities as a result of completing acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities such actions could impact our operating results and the price of our common stock 

 

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings

 

we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

   

risks associated with financial reporting 

  

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

 

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision including the effects of the us tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 “2017 tax act” and the enactment of other tax laws we engage thirdparty tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which if material would result in us having to restate our financial statements restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations damage our reputation andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or by changes in tax laws such as the 2017 tax act regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items in addition we are subject to potential future examinations of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and tax authorities in various jurisdictions where we have business operations we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

   

our international operations subject us to potentially significant tax consequences which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we conduct our international operations through whollyowned subsidiaries branches and representative offices and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions such corporate structures are subject to complex transfer pricing and other local regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions the relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions if such a disagreement were to occur and our positions were not sustained we could be required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties resulting in higher effective tax rates reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations additionally our future worldwide tax rate and financial position may be affected by changes in the relevant tax laws interpretation of such tax laws or the influence of certain tax policy efforts of the european union and the organization for economic cooperation and development

 

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting 

 

effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct our business and operating results could be harmed our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and could subject us to stockholder litigation in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

 

 

risks associated with regulatory compliance intellectual property protection and litigation 

  

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act the “ fcpa ”  our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which place us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by the us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

our business is subject to various governmental laws and regulations and compliance with these regulations may impact our revenue and cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations or obtain government licenses and approvals for our desired international trading activities or technology transfers we may be forced to recall products and cease their distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

 

our business is subject to various significant laws and other legal requirements imposed by the us and other countries we conduct business with including export control laws such as the export administration act the export administration regulations and other laws regulations and requirements governing international trade and technology transfer these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend sales to these customers which could negatively impact our results of operations we must conform the manufacture and distribution of our products to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in many countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products we could be required to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products are brought into compliance

 

environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations 

  

we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of certain products such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate including various european union member countries and countries in asia there can be no assurance that similar laws and regulations will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs possible delays in delivering products and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future products if the cost were to become prohibitive

 

if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

 

from time to time we are a party to various legal proceedings if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be significant we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and end users could decide not to use our products and our products and our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings

 

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publicly disclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

 

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in us incurring unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be materially impacted

 

 

future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses our financial condition could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time and effort to these legal proceedings which could divert management’s attention from focusing on our operations and adversely affect our business

 

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business 

  

risks associated with human capital management 

  

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could affect our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands of our business including design cycles our business could be harmed furthermore if we lose key personnel the search for a qualified replacement and the transition could interrupt our operations as the search could take us longer than expected and divert management resources and the newly hired employee could take longer than expected to integrate into the team

  

if we fail to retain key employees in our sales applications finance and legal staff or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

 

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal staff maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal control that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected

  

risks associated with ownership of our stock 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

 

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including

 

  

 

  

  

 

  

in addition the stock market often experiences substantial volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

  

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

 

short positions in our stock could have a substantial impact on the trading price of our stock 

 

historically there have been “short” positions in our common stock the anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of our stock by some institutions or individuals who engage in short sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline such stock price decreases could encourage further shortsales that could place additional downward pressure on our stock price this could lead to further increases in the existing short position in our common stock and cause volatility in our stock price the volatility of our stock may cause the value of a stockholder’s investment to decline rapidly additionally if our stock price declines it may be more difficult for us to raise capital and may have other adverse effects on our business

 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

  

we have a dividend program approved by our board of directors pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock the declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock

 

if we issue additional shares of stock in the future it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 

  

we may issue additional shares of common stock in the future in order to raise additional capital to fund our global operations or in connection with an acquisition we also issue restricted stock units “rsus” to employees which convert into shares of common stock upon vesting any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate dilution to our stockholders in addition the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may result in additional regulatory requirements such as stockholder approval

 

general risk factors 

 

our worldwide operations are subject to political economic and health risks and natural disasters which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 

 

our offices in california and washington the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer suppliers our ic testing and manufacturing facilities a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia particularly in china such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics and pandemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations for example the covid19 pandemic has resulted in disruptions in business operations and other global economic activities any of these events may cause disruptions and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations

 

 

in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruptions systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations

overview 

 

we are a leading semiconductor company that designs develops and markets highperformance power solutions incorporated in 1997 our core strengths include deep systemlevel and applications knowledge strong analog design expertise and innovative proprietary process technologies these combined strengths enable us to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energyefficient costeffective easytouse solutions for systems found in computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer applications our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers’ systems with green practical and compact solutions we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energyefficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families as well as in new innovative product categories

 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products we are not immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term

 

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ics this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths

 

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up typical lead times for orders are generally 16 to 26 weeks these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult

 

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia where our products are incorporated into enduser products our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia was 91 89 and 88 for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter products which serve the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity

  

impact of covid19 on our business 

 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak a pandemic which continues to spread rapidly in the us and globally governmental authorities have implemented numerous containment measures including travelrelated restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business restrictions and shutdowns these measures have significantly affected the global economy and are disrupting business operations worldwide for an unknown period of time until the disease is contained economic conditions remained uncertain as of the end of 2020

 

our primary focus is to continue to execute our business plan and mitigate the effect of the pandemic on our financial position and operations while actively taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our employees our suppliers and our customers the pandemic did not materially and adversely impact our overall operating results or business operations during 2020 some of the key developments and initiatives we implemented since march 2020 include but are not limited to the following

 

  

 

  

  

  

we are actively working with our stakeholders including customers suppliers and employees to address the impact of the pandemic we will continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our business supply chain and customers and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences however we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy the semiconductor industry and our business a prolonged economic slowdown as a result of the pandemic could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition for 2021 and beyond

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation inventories income taxes and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control including demand for our products economic conditions and other current and future events such as the impact of the covid19 pandemic actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and any such differences may   be material to our consolidated financial statements 

 

as of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements we are not   aware of any specific event or circumstance related to the pandemic that would require management to update the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  as new events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available any changes to these estimates and assumptions will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

 

 

revenue recognition   

 

we generate revenue primarily from product sales which include assembled and tested ics as well as dies in wafer form these product sales accounted for 97 99 and 98 of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018  respectively the remaining revenue primarily includes royalty revenue from licensing arrangements and revenue from wafer testing services performed for third   parties which have not   been significant in all periods presented

 

we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services

 

product sales consist of a single performance obligation that we satisfy at a point in time we recognize product revenue from distributors and direct end customers when the following events have occurred a we have transferred physical possession of the products b we have a present right to payment c the customer has legal title to the products and d the customer bears significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the contracts these criteria are generally met when the products are shipped from our facilities such as the “ex works” shipping term or delivered to the customers’ locations such as the “delivered duty paid” shipping term

 

under certain consignment agreements revenue is not   recognized when the products are shipped and delivered to be held at customers’ designated locations because we continue to control the products and retain ownership and the customers do not   have an unconditional obligation to pay we recognize revenue when the customers consume the products from the consigned inventory locations or in some cases after a 60day period from the delivery date has passed at which time control transfers to the customers and we invoice them for payment

 

we account for price adjustment and stock rotation rights as variable consideration that reduces the transaction price and recognize that reduction in the same period the associated revenue is recognized four usbased distributors have price adjustment rights when they sell our products to their end customers at a price that is lower than the distribution price invoiced by us when we receive claims from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers at the lower price we issue the distributors credit memos for the price adjustments we estimate the price adjustments using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical claims at both the distributor and product level as well as an assessment of any known trends of product sales mix other us distributors and nonus distributors which make up the majority of our total sales to distributors do not   have price adjustment rights we record a credit against accounts receivable for the estimated price adjustments with a corresponding reduction to revenue

 

certain distributors have limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases in accordance with the contract terms we estimate the stock rotation returns using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical returns and the current level of inventory in the distribution channel we record a liability for the stock rotation reserve with a corresponding reduction to revenue in addition we recognize an asset for product returns which represents the right to recover products from the customers related to stock rotations with a corresponding reduction to cost of revenue

   

we pay sales commissions based on the achievement of predetermined product sales targets we have elected the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less 

    

inventory valuation 

 

we value our inventories at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or their current estimated net realizable value we write down excess and obsolete inventories based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required conversely if actual demand or market conditions are more favorable inventories may be sold that were previously written down 

 

accounting for income taxes 

  

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized

 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments

 

 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had a valuation allowance of 182 million and 154 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be fully realized in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax assets valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made

 

contingencies 

 

we are a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business including potential litigation regarding our stockholders and our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and employment matters the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations

  

stockbased compensation 

  

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award   the fair value of rsus with service conditions is based on the grant date share price the fair value of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan “espp” and rsus with performance conditions is estimated using the blackscholes model the fair value of rsus with market conditions as well as rsus containing both market and performance conditions is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model 

 

compensation expense related to awards with service conditions is recorded on a straightline basis over the requisite service period compensation expense related to awards subject to market or performance conditions is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche for awards with performance conditions as well as awards containing both market and performance conditions we recognize compensation expense when the performance goals are achieved or when it becomes probable that the performance goals will be achieved management performs the probability assessment on a quarterly basis by reviewing external factors such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry revenue forecasts and internal factors such as our business and operational objectives and revenue forecasts changes in the probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catchup adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date if the projected achievement was revised upward or if the actual results were higher than the projected achievement additional compensation expense would be recorded for the awards due to the cumulative catchup adjustment which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations conversely if the projected achievement was revised downward or if the actual results were lower than the projected achievement previously accrued compensation expense would be reversed for the awards which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations as a result our stockbased compensation expense is subject to volatility and may fluctuate significantly each quarter due to changes in our probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions or actual results being different from projections made by management

 

we account for forfeitures of equity awards when they occur

revenue 

 

the following table summarizes our revenue by end market

 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 was 8445 million an increase of 2166 million or 345 from 6279 million for the year ended december 31 2019 this increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets overall unit shipments increased by 7 and average sales prices increased by approximately 24 compared to the same period in 2019 the increase in average sales prices was primarily driven by favorable changes in product mix with more sales coming from products with higher unit prices 

 

for the year ended december 31 2020 revenue from the communications market increased 575 million or 678 from the same period in 2019 this increase was primarily driven by increased infrastructure sales revenue from the consumer market increased 562 million or 342 from the same period in 2019 this increase was primarily driven by increased sales for gaming and mobile products revenue from the computing and storage market increased 640 million or 338 from the same period in 2019 this increase was primarily driven by strength in cloud computing and storage revenue from the automotive market increased 187 million or 207 from the same period in 2019 this increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment applications despite temporary production shutdowns by certain oems during the second quarter due to the covid19 pandemic revenue from the industrial market increased 202 million or 203 from the same period in 2019 this increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source products

 

 

 

cost of revenue and gross margin  

 

cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred to manufacture assemble and test our products as well as warranty costs inventoryrelated and other overhead costs and stockbased compensation expenses 

 

  

cost of revenue was 3785 million or 448 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 and 2816 million or 448 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 the 969 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 7 increase in overall unit shipments and a 22 increase in the average direct cost of units shipped the increase in cost of revenue was also driven by an increase in warranty expenses inventory writedowns and manufacturing overhead costs

 

gross margin was 552 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with 552 for the year ended december 31 2019 for the year ended december 31 2020 the impact of a more favorable product mix was primarily offset by higher warranty expenses and inventory writedowns as a percentage of revenue compared to the same period in 2019

 

research and development “rd” 

 

rd expenses primarily consist of salary and benefit expenses bonuses stockbased compensation and deferred compensation for design and product engineers expenses related to new product development and supplies and facility costs 

 

  

 

rd expenses were 1376 million or 163 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 and 1078 million or 172 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 the 298 million increase in rd expenses was primarily due to an increase of 223 million in compensation expenses which include salary benefits and bonuses an increase of 30 million in new product development expenses and an increase of 17 million in depreciation our rd headcount was 930 employees as of december 31 2020 compared with 839 employees as of december 31 2019   

 

selling general and administrative “sga” 

  

sga expenses primarily include salary and benefit expenses bonuses stockbased compensation and deferred compensation for sales marketing and administrative personnel sales commissions travel expenses facilities costs and professional service fees 

 

  

sga expenses were 1617 million or 191 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 and 1335 million or 213 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 the 282 million increase in sga expenses was primarily due to an increase of 154 million in compensation expenses which include salary benefits and bonuses an increase of 62 million in stockbased compensation expenses which were mainly associated with performancebased equity awards and an increase of 42 million in commission expenses driven by higher revenue our sga headcount was 564 employees as of december 31 2020 compared with 503 employees as of december 31 2019 

 

litigation expense 

 

litigation expense was 78 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with 25 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the increase was due to increased litigation activity related to ongoing patent infringement and other matters

 

other income net 

 

other income net was 105 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with other income net of 106 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease was primarily due to an increase of 23 million in amortization of the premium on availableforsale securities and an increase of 11 million in foreign currency exchange losses these unfavorable changes were partially offset by an increase of 20 million in interest income primarily as a result of higher investment balances and an increase of 08 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments

 

 

income tax expense 

 

the income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2020   was 50 million or 29 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in bermuda and china being taxed at lower statutory tax rates and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation the decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” tax

 

the income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2019 was 43 million or 38 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in bermuda and china being taxed at lower statutory tax rates the impact of certain tax credits and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation the decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the gilti tax

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  

as of december 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 3349 million and shortterm investments of 2602 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of 1730 million and shortterm investments of 2824 million as of december 31 2019 as of december 31 2020 2521 million of cash and cash equivalents and 1308 million of shortterm investments were held by our international subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2020 we repatriated 30 million of cash from our bermuda subsidiary to the us the proceeds will primarily be used to fund our ongoing business operations we may repatriate additional cash from our bermuda subsidiary to fund our expenditures in future periods we anticipate that earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested

 

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable inventories and other current assets reduced by accounts payable accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities as of december 31 2020 we had working capital of 6950 million compared with working capital of 5570 million as of december 31 2019 the 1380 million increase in working capital was due to a 1868 million increase in current assets which was partially offset by a 488 million increase in current liabilities the increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and inventories which was partially offset by a decrease in shortterm investments the increase in current liabilities was due to an increase in accounts payable accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities

 

 

summary of cash flows 

 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2020 net cash provided by operating activities was 2678 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation and a net increase of 30 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in accounts receivable was driven by increased sales during the three months ended december 31 2020 the increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in wafer and die inventories to meet current demand and future growth the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory purchases to meet future demand the increase in accrued compensation was primarily due to an increase in accrued bonuses the increase in other accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in the deferred compensation plan liabilities and an increase in warranty expenses 

 

for the year ended december 31 2019 net cash provided by operating activities was 2163 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation and a net increase of 178 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in other assets was primarily due to an increase in prepaid income taxes and an increase in certain tax withholding proceeds receivable related to rsus that vested at the end of the year the increase in other accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan the decrease in inventories was primarily driven by a decrease in wafer and die purchases 

 

for the year ended december 31 2020 net cash used in investing activities was 392 million primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of 556 million partially offset by net sales and maturities of shortterm investments of 221 million for the year ended december 31 2019 net cash used in investing activities was 1671 million primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of 958 million net purchases of shortterm investments of 768 million and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of 31 million these cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from sales of property and equipment of 93 million

 

for the year ended december 31 2019 we funded the purchases of properties in kirkland washington and livonia michigan for 574 million

 

for the year ended december 31 2020 net cash used in financing activities was 716 million primarily reflecting 888 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus which was partially offset by 226 million of cash proceeds from the vesting of rsus and the issuance of shares through our espp for the year ended december 31 2019 net cash used in financing activities was 481 million primarily reflecting 673 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus which was partially offset by 199 million of cash proceeds from the vesting of rsus and the issuance of shares through our espp 

 

in february 2021 our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividends from 050 per share to 060 per share

 

we anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments as well as payments for the onetime deemed repatriation transition tax and other expenditures will come from our domestic cash cash generated from ongoing us operations and cash repatriated from our bermuda subsidiary we also anticipate that earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested

 

 

although consequences of the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future and cash requirements may fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we currently believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and shortterm investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months 

 

in the future in order to strengthen our financial position respond to adverse developments such as the covid19 pandemic changes in our circumstance or unforeseen events or conditions or fund our growth we may need to discontinue paying dividends and dividend equivalents and may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities issuing debt or convertible debt securities incurring indebtedness secured by our assets or selling certain product lines andor portions of our business accordingly we cannot ensure that we will continue to pay dividends and dividend equivalents in the future and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all

 

from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning capital investments and potential acquisitions of product lines technologies businesses and companies and we continue to consider potential investments and acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities assumptions of debt andor payment of cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such investments or acquisitions through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by management and approved by the audit committee of the board of directors such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities based on our investment positions as of december 31 2020 a hypothetical 10 decline in interest rates would impact our results of operations by approximately 09 million in interest income

 

investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale which are reported at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets when the fair value of an investment is below its amortized cost basis unrealized losses due to changes in interest rates ie noncredit loss factors are not recognized in our results of operations unless we have the intent to sell the securities or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis based on our investment positions as of december 31 2020 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a 26 million decline in the fair value of our investments any losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity

 

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

our sales outside the united states are primarily transacted in us dollars through our subsidiary in bermuda accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes the functional currency of our offshore operations is generally the local currency primarily including the renminbi the new taiwan dollar and the euro in addition we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain intercompany transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency gains or losses from the settlement and remeasurement of the balances are reported in other income net on the consolidated statements of operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations in any of the periods presented

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

 

based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2020 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control—integrated framework   2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2020 management reviewed the results of its assessment with our audit committee

 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as stated in the firm’s attestation report which appears in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have implemented workfromhome arrangements in accordance with local shelterinplace orders and other governmental restrictions in the united states and certain international locations during the year ended december 31 2020 we have reviewed our financial reporting process and business continuity plans in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment operating procedures and data we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting continue to be effective 

 

limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures 

 

in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs

industry overview 

 

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or integrated circuits “ics” in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world to digital systems

 

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for high performance analog and mixedsignal ics high performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixedsignal ic markets from digital ic markets these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer aboveaverage growth over the long term compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole

  

end markets and applications 

 

we design and develop our products for the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets with the computing and storage market representing the largest portion of our revenue in 2019 the following table is a summary of the various end market applications for our products and those markets’ contribution as a percentage of our total revenue 

 

  

 

product families 

 

our proprietary process technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller singlechip power management ics these technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of analog applications within the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets our product families are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions our key product families include the following

 

direct current  “ dc ”  to dc products dc to dc ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers and monitors automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc products are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current high switching speed and small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices the dc to dc product family accounted for 94 92 and 92 of our total revenue in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively   

 

lighting control products lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers monitors car navigation systems and televisions backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps the lighting control product family accounted for 6 8 and 8 of our total revenue in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively

 

in the future we plan to continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as expand our newer product families our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of china taiwan and other asian markets expand our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity

 

customers sales and marketing 

 

we sell our products through thirdparty distributors valueadded resellers and directly to original equipment manufacturers “oems” original design manufacturers “odms” and electronic manufacturing service “ems” providers our thirdparty distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributors to sell our products to end customers and other resellers including oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers 

 

sales to our largest distributor accounted for 23 of our total revenue in 2019 22 in 2018 and 17 in 2017 in addition one other distributor accounted for 10 of our total revenue in 2018 and one other distributor accounted for 10 of our total revenue in 2017 no other distributors or end customers accounted for more than 10 of our fullyear total revenue in any of the periods presented

 

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor has the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 60 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements

 

we have sales offices located in china india japan korea singapore taiwan the united states and throughout europe our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems’ electronics containing our products

 

because our sales are primarily billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because a majority of our revenue is attributable to sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 our revenue from sales to customers in asia was 89 88 and 89 respectively

 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped because orders in backlog are subject to cancellation or postponement and backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue

 

 

our manufacturing lead times are generally 8 to 16 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount take a significant writedown or dispose of it altogether all of which would negatively affect our profit margins in addition in response to market conditions we may slow the rate of manufacturing our products which could result in insufficient inventory levels if we underestimate the demand for our products

 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term

 

research and development 

 

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers primarily in china spain taiwan and the united states with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies

 

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products in the area of process technology we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technology is a key strategic component to our future growth 

 

patents and intellectual property matters 

 

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies

 

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of december 31 2019 we had 1162 patentsapplications issued or pending of which 419 patents have been issued in the united states our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2039 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers or could pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products are found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows

   

 

manufacturing 

 

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ics this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technologies and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their equipment in their facilities for use on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our ics

 

we currently contract with six suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china and korea once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort which is a testing process performed to identify nonfunctioning dies our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in china and malaysia the assembled ics are then sent either for final testing at our chengdu facility or to other turnkey providers who perform final testing based on our standards prior to shipping to our customers

 

we have a 60000 squarefoot manufacturing facility located in chengdu china which enables us to benefit from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs we have expanded our product testing capabilities in this facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations

 

key personnel and employees 

 

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer does analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2019 we employed 2002 employees primarily located in asia europe and the united states compared with 1737 employees as of december 31 2018

 

competition 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing average selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and in some cases have a broader number of product offerings that may enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least ten manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices infineon technologies maxim integrated products nxp semiconductors on semiconductor power integrations renesas electronics rohm semiconductor semtech and texas instruments

 

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however there is no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market in addition there has recently been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry if these or future acquisitions are successful competition may intensify and our competitors may have additional resources to compete against us

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business involves numerous risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the sec in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements

 

 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

 

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including

 

  

  

  

 

  

  

in addition the stock market often experiences substantial volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

 

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year over year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

 

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including

 

  

  

 

  

  

  

  

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline and be volatile

 

our business has been and may be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions in particular changing economic conditions in china 

 

in recent years global credit and financial markets experienced disruptions and may experience disruptions in the future including diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability economic uncertainty affects businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish liquidity and capital availability

 

demand for our products is a function of the health of the economies in the united states europe china and the rest of asia we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic disruption or subsequent economic recovery worldwide in our industry or in the different markets that we serve we also may not accurately assess the impact of changing market and economic conditions on our business and operations these and other economic factors have had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results

 

in particular since we have significant operations in china our business development plans results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by significant political social and economic developments in china a slowdown in economic growth in china could adversely impact our customers prospective customers suppliers distributors and partners in china which could have a material adverse effect on our results of the operations and financial condition there is no guarantee that economic downturns whether actual or perceived any further decrease in economic growth rates or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook in china will not occur or persist in the future that they will not be protracted or that governments will respond adequately to control and reverse such conditions any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

recent changes in international trade policy and rising concern of international tariffs including tariffs applied to goods traded between the united states and china could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

since the beginning of 2018 there has been increasing rhetoric in some cases coupled with legislative or executive action from several us and foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials more specifically there have been several rounds of us tariffs on chinese goods taking effect in 2018 and 2019 some of which prompted retaliatory chinese tariffs on us goods the institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the us and china specifically carries the risk of negatively affecting china’s overall economic condition which could have a negative impact on us as we have significant operations in china furthermore imposition of tariffs could cause a decrease in the sales of our products to customers located in china or other customers selling to chinese end users which would directly impact our business financial condition and results of operations

  

we are subject to export restrictions and laws affecting trade and investments that could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

as a global company headquartered in the united states we are subject to us laws and regulations that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially limited our operations or our sales but could materially limit them in the future which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations we maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented exposing us to legal liabilities we must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted our operations in the recent past there is a significant risk that they could do so in the future which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition us laws and regulations and sanctions or threat of sanctions that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services to our customers may also encourage our customers to develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

moreover us government’s actions targeting exports of certain technologies to china are becoming more pervasive for example in may 2019 president trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic powers to implement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of information communications technology in transactions that imposed undue national security risks these actions could lead to additional restrictions on the export of products that include or enable certain technologies including products we provide to chinabased customers

 

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand the semiconductor industry is currently experiencing such a downturn these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall any significant or prolonged downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

 

our profitability is dependent on many factors including

 

  

  

 

  

  

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in our operations including any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability

 

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

 

in the past our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products we are subject to numerous risks and factors that could cause a decrease in our growth rates compared to past periods including increased competition loss of certain of our customers unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand a deterioration in market conditions endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and litigation a material decrease in our growth rates could adversely affect our stock price and results of operations   

 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

 

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above industry averages should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

  

in recent years there has been a trend toward semiconductor industry consolidation we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to improve the leverage of growing research and development costs strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry or become unable to continue operations unless they find an acquirer or consolidate with another company in addition companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that semiconductor industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

 

we believe that the application of our products in the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected

 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

 

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors

 

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets

 

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including

 

  

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

we may face competition from customers developing products internally 

  

our customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources some customers have traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of thirdparty sourcing for products as an alternative to inhouse development customers may in the future continue to use internally developed components they may also decide to develop or acquire components technologies or products that are similar to or that may be substituted for our products if our customers fail to accept our products as an alternative if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

 

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

 

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct sales or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and valueadded reseller agreements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2019 89 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including

 

  

  

  

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we depend on a limited number of customers including distributors for a significant percentage of our revenue 

 

historically we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers including distributors for example sales to our largest distributor accounted for 23 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenue a decrease in demand or significant pricing pressure for our products from any of our major customers for any reason including due to competition market conditions catastrophic events or otherwise could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act the “ fcpa ”  our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which place us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by the us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

   

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements valueadded resellers and direct customers and the loss of any one of these distributors valueadded resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

 

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and ems providers receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible sales to our largest distributor accounted for 23 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply commitments 

 

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an end customer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or an oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

 

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

 

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  as a result this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations delays in increasing thirdparty manufacturing capacity may also limit our ability to meet customer demand

 

 

we currently depend on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

 

we have a supply arrangement with certain suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue

 

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management of the supplier relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

 

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

 

we do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as global economic crises may materially impact our assembly suppliers’ ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our thirdparty suppliers’ manufacturing capacity 

 

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops and testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities such activities are subject to a number of risks including

 

  

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty suppliers’ capacity

 

 

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

 

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from thirdparty manufacturers in advance of selling our products we place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the timeframe that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in addition a perceived negative trend in market condition could lead us to decrease the manufacturing volume of our products to avoid excess inventory if we inaccurately assessed the market conditions for our products we would have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigation or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be written down or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

 

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision including the effects of the 2017 tax act and the enactment of other tax laws we engage thirdparty tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which if material would result in us having to restate our financial statements restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations damage our reputation andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or by changes in tax laws such as the 2017 tax act regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items such as vesting of restricted stock units “rsus” in addition we are subject to potential future examinations of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

   

our international operations subject us to potentially significant tax consequences which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we conduct our international operations through whollyowned subsidiaries branches and representative offices and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions such corporate structures are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions the relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions if such a disagreement were to occur and our positions were not sustained we could be required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties resulting in higher effective tax rates reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations additionally our future worldwide tax rate and financial position may be affected by changes in the relevant tax laws interpretation of such tax laws or the influence of certain tax policy efforts of the european union and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd

 

implementation of an enterprise resource planning “erp” or other information technology systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations 

 

from time to time we may implement new erp software solutions or upgrade existing systems implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of system providers and internal business teams we may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes including loss or corruption of financial business or customer data in addition transitioning to these new systems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or any significant system failures could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources financial condition or results of operations

 

 

system security risks data protection or privacy breaches cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations andor harm our reputation and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue increase our expenses negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price 

 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution financial reporting or other critical functions

 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data on our internal systems network and servers such as proprietary business and financial information and confidential data pertaining to our customers suppliers and business partners the secure maintenance of sensitive information on our networks and the protection features of our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy we devote significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data however these security measures cannot provide absolute security although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and solutions any destructive or intrusive breach could compromise our networks creating system disruptions or slowdowns and the information stored on our networks could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen if any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data our relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially damaged our reputation could be materially harmed and we could be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible significant liability

 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and our remediation efforts may be expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation

 

effective may 25 2018 the european union  “ eu ” implemented the general data protection regulation  “ gdpr ” a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of current eu data protection law to noneuropean union entities that process or control the processing of the personal information of eu subjects the gdpr allows for the imposition of fines and corrective action on entities that improperly use or disclose the personal information of eu subjects including through a data security breach the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act of 2018  “ ccpa ”  effective on january 1 2020 which contains requirements similar to gdpr for the handling of personal information of california residents commencing on january 1 2020

 

our failure to fully comply with gdpr ccpa and other laws could lead to significant fines and require onerous corrective action in addition data security breaches experienced by us could result in the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property public disclosure of sensitive commercial data and the exposure of personally identifiable information including sensitive personal information of our employees customers suppliers and others

 

unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf whether through breach of our systems breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party or through employee error theft or misuse or otherwise could harm our business if any such unauthorized use or disclosure of or access to such personal information was to occur our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to demands claims and litigation by private parties and investigations related actions and penalties by regulatory authorities in addition we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of personal information finally any perceived or actual unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of such information could harm our reputation substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers we could be prevented from selling many of our products or be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

 

from time to time we are a party to various legal proceedings if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be significant we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and end users could decide not to use our products and our products and our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings

 

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publicly disclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

 

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in us incurring unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be materially impacted

 

future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses our financial condition could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time and effort to these legal proceedings which could divert management’s attention from focusing on our operations and adversely affect our business

 

 

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business 

 

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting 

 

effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct our business and operating results could be harmed our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and could subject us to stockholder litigation in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

 

our products must meet specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

 

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet ics as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is generally one to two years which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results

 

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims

 

the price and availability of commodities eg gold copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

our products incorporate commodities such as gold copper and silicon an increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations

 

 

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the renminbi may adversely affect results of operations 

 

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future if the value of the renminbi rises against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition our sales are primarily denominated in the us dollar if the value of the us dollar rises against other currencies it may adversely affect the demand for our products in international markets which could negatively impact our business and results of operations

 

we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the timing of payments for transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries which are reported in interest and other income in the statements of operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the amount of foreign currency exchange losses we record which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations

 

our business is subject to various governmental laws and regulations and compliance with these regulations may impact our revenue and cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations or obtain government licenses and approvals for our desired international trading activities or technology transfers we may be forced to recall products and cease their distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

 

our business is subject to various significant laws and other legal requirements imposed by the us and other countries we conduct business with including export control laws such as the export administration act the export administration regulations “ear” and other laws regulations and requirements governing international trade and technology transfer these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend sales to these customers which could negatively impact our results of operations we must conform the manufacture and distribution of our products to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in many countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products we could be required to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products are brought into compliance

 

environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations 

  

we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of certain products such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate including various european union member countries and countries in asia there can be no assurance that similar laws and regulations will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs possible delays in delivering products and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future products if the cost were to become prohibitive

 

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

 

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china and most of our manufacturing partners are located in china the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china additionally china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies

 

personal privacy cyber security and data protection are becoming increasingly significant issues in china to address these issues the standing committee of the national people’s congress promulgated the cyber security law of the people’s republic of china the “cyber security law” which took effect on june 1 2017 the cyber security law sets forth various requirements relating to the collection use storage disclosure and security of data among other things various chinese agencies are expected to issue additional regulations in the future to define these requirements more precisely these requirements may increase our costs of compliance we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of these regulatory requirements   any failure to comply with the cyber security law and the relevant regulations and policies could result in further cost and liability to us and could adversely affect our business and results of operations additionally increased costs to comply with and other burdens imposed by the cyber security law and relevant regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our suppliers vendors and other service providers as well as our customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations

 

any additional new regulations or the amendment or modification of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results

 

 

the chinese government and provincial and local governments also have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facilities in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to us and our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing and testing facilities in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

 

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china we face the following risks among others with respect to our operations in china

 

  

if we are unable to maintain our facilities in china at fully operational status with qualified workers appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected

  

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and could do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profits 

 

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own wafer manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our profit margins

 

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

 

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures may be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it generally takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons including

 

  

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

 

 

our success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

 

our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development we expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and introduce new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability if we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results also if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources we could see material adverse effects on our business financial condition and operating results

 

in addition if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development

 

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could affect our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands of our business including design cycles our business could be harmed furthermore if we lose key personnel the search for a qualified replacement and the transition could interrupt our operations as the search could take us longer than expected and divert management resources and the newly hired employee could take longer than expected to integrate into the team

 

if we fail to retain key employees in our sales applications finance and legal staff or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

 

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal staff maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal control that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected

 

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

 

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships andor acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire in addition acquisitions could result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders reduce our cash balances and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities which could adversely affect our business we may also be the target of strategic transactions which could divert our management’s attention and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business 

 

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities as a result of completing acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities such actions could impact our operating results and the price of our common stock 

 

 

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings

 

we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with

 

  

in addition third parties may be interested in acquiring us we will consider and discuss such transactions as we deem appropriate such potential transactions may diver the attention of management and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in investigating and evaluating such transactions whether or not they are consummated

  

if we issue additional shares of stock in the future it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 

  

we may issue additional shares of common stock in the future in order to raise additional capital to fund our global operations or in connection with an acquisition we also issue rsus to employees which convert into shares of common stock upon vesting any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate dilution to our stockholders in addition the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may result in additional regulatory requirements such as stockholder approval

 

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with many manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate 

 

 

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition

 

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

 

short positions in our stock could have a substantial impact on the trading price of our stock 

 

historically there have been “short” positions in our common stock the anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of our stock by some institutions or individuals who engage in short sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline such stock price decreases could encourage further shortsales that could place additional downward pressure on our stock price this could lead to further increases in the existing short position in our common stock and cause volatility in our stock price the volatility of our stock may cause the value of a stockholder’s investment to decline rapidly additionally if our stock price declines it may be more difficult for us to raise capital and may have other adverse effects on our business

  

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

  

we have a dividend program approved by our board of directors pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock the declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock

  

our worldwide operations are subject to political economic and health risks and natural disasters which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 

 

our office in california the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer suppliers our ic testing and manufacturing facilities a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia particularly in china such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations for example the covid19 outbreak first identified in china in december 2019 has resulted in significant disruptions in business operations and other economic activities in certain parts of the country the world health organization has declared the growing disease to be a global health emergency and the us government has issued travel restrictions to and from china any of these events may disrupt our ability to staff our business adequately could generally disrupt our operations and specifically any prolonged health threat from covid19 globally could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and results of operations

 

in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruptions systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k

 

overview 

 

we are a leading semiconductor company that designs develops and markets highperformance power solutions incorporated in 1997 mps’s core strengths include deep systemlevel and applications knowledge strong analog design expertise and an innovative proprietary process technology these combined strengths enable mps to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energyefficient costeffective easytouse solutions for systems found in computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer applications our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers’ systems with green practical and compact solutions we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energyefficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families as well as in new innovative product categories

 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products we are not immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term

 

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ics this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths

 

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up typical lead times for orders are generally 8 to 16 weeks these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult

 

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia where our products are incorporated into enduser products our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia was 89 88 and 89 for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter products which serve the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation inventories income taxes and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

 

revenue recognition 

 

we generate revenue primarily from product sales which include assembled and tested integrated circuits as well as dies in wafer form these product sales were 99 98 and 98 of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the remaining revenue primarily includes royalty revenue from licensing arrangements and revenue from wafer testing services performed for third parties which have not been significant in all periods presented

 

 

we recognize revenue from product sales when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services

 

product sales consist of a single performance obligation that we satisfy at a point in time we recognize product revenue from distributors and direct end customers when the following events have occurred a we have transferred physical possession of the products b we have a present right to payment c the customer has legal title to the products and d the customer bears significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the contracts these criteria are generally met when the products are shipped from our facilities such as the “ex works” shipping term or delivered to the customers’ locations such as the “delivered duty paid” shipping term

 

under certain consignment agreements revenue is not recognized when the products are shipped and delivered to be held at customers’ designated locations because we continue to control the products and retain ownership and the customers do not have an unconditional obligation to pay we recognize revenue when the customers consume the products from the consigned inventory locations or in some cases after a 60day period from the delivery date has passed at which time control transfers to the customers and we invoice them for payment

 

we account for price adjustment and stock rotation rights as variable consideration that reduces the transaction price and recognize that reduction in the same period the associated revenue is recognized three usbased distributors have price adjustment rights when they sell our products to their end customers at a price that is lower than the distribution price invoiced by us when we receive claims from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers at the lower price we issue the distributors credit memos for the price adjustments we estimate the price adjustments using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical claims at both the distributor and product level as well as an assessment of any known trends of product sales mix other us distributors and nonus distributors which make up the majority of our total sales to distributors do not have price adjustment rights we record a credit against accounts receivable for the estimated price adjustments with a corresponding reduction to revenue

 

certain distributors have limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases in accordance with the contract terms we estimate the stock rotation returns using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical returns and the current level of inventory in the distribution channel we record a liability for the stock rotation reserve with a corresponding reduction to revenue in addition we recognize an asset for product returns which represents the right to recover products from the customers related to stock rotations with a corresponding reduction to cost of revenue

   

we pay sales commissions based on the achievement of predetermined product sales targets we have elected the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less 

    

inventory valuation 

 

we value our inventories at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or their current estimated net realizable value we write down excess and obsolete inventories based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required conversely if actual demand or market conditions are more favorable inventories may be sold that were previously written down 

 

 

accounting for income taxes 

  

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized

 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments

 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we had a valuation allowance of 154 million and 130 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be fully realized in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax assets valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made

 

contingencies 

 

we are a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business including potential litigation regarding our stockholders and our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and employment matters the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award   the fair value of rsus with service conditions or performance conditions is based on the grant date share price the fair value of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan “espp” and rsus with a purchase price feature is estimated using the blackscholes model the fair value of rsus with market conditions as well as rsus containing both market and performance conditions is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model 

 

compensation expense related to awards with service conditions is recorded on a straightline basis over the requisite service period compensation expense related to awards subject to market or performance conditions is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche for awards with only market conditions compensation expense is not reversed if the market conditions are not satisfied for awards with performance conditions as well as awards containing both market and performance conditions we recognize compensation expense when the performance goals are achieved or when it becomes probable that the performance goals will be achieved management performs the probability assessment on a quarterly basis by reviewing external factors such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry revenue forecasts and internal factors such as our business and operational objectives and revenue forecasts changes in the probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catchup adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date if the projected achievement was revised upward or if the actual results were higher than the projected achievement additional compensation expense would be recorded for the awards due to the cumulative catchup adjustment which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations conversely if the projected achievement was revised downward or if the actual results were lower than the projected achievement previously accrued compensation expense would be reversed for the awards which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations as a result our stockbased compensation expense is subject to volatility and may fluctuate significantly each quarter due to changes in our probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions or actual results being different from projections made by management

 

we account for forfeitures of equity awards when they occur

litigation expense 

 

litigation expense was 25 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with 19 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff

 

litigation expense was 19 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared with 12 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff

 

interest and other income net 

 

interest and other income net was 106 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with 50 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase of 48 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments an increase of 10 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields and a decrease of 06 million in amortization of premium on availableforsale securities these favorable changes were partially offset by an increase of 13 million in foreign currency exchange losses

income tax provision 

 

the income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2019 was 43 million or 38 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in bermuda and china being taxed at lower statutory tax rates the impact of certain tax credits and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation the decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” tax

 

the income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2018 was 132 million or 112 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in bermuda and china being taxed at lower statutory tax rates the decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the gilti tax

 

the income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2017 was 177 million or 214 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in bermuda and china being taxed at lower rates and the release of the us valuation allowance the decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially impacted by the effects of the 2017 tax act including the remeasurement of deferred taxes and the onetime deemed repatriation transition tax

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  

as of december 31 2019 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1730 million and shortterm investments of 2824 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of 1727 million and shortterm investments of 2046 million as of december 31 2018 as of december 31 2019 995 million of cash and cash equivalents and 1867 million of shortterm investments were held by our international subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2019 we repatriated 75 million of cash from our bermuda subsidiary to the us the proceeds were primarily used to fund real estate purchases and cash dividend payments we may repatriate additional cash from our bermuda subsidiary to fund our expenditures in future periods we anticipate that earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested

 

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable inventories and other current assets reduced by accounts payable accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities as of december 31 2019 we had working capital of 5570 million compared with working capital of 5004 million as of december 31 2018 the 566 million increase in working capital was due to a 744 million increase in current assets which was partially offset by a 178 million increase in current liabilities the increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in shortterm investments and other current assets which was partially offset by a decrease in inventories the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities

 

summary of cash flows 

 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2019 net cash provided by operating activities was 2163 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation and a net increase of 178 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in other assets was primarily due to an increase in prepaid income taxes and an increase in certain tax withholding proceeds receivable related to rsus that vested at the end of the year the increase in other accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan the decrease in inventories was primarily driven by a decrease in wafer and die purchases 

 

 

for the year ended december 31 2018 net cash provided by operating activities was 1415 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation and a net decrease of 375 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by increased sales the increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan

 

for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash provided by operating activities was 1338 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and deferred taxes and a net increase of 157 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in deferred taxes was primarily due to the release of the us valuation allowance partially offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax balance in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the 2017 tax act the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by higher sales the increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan and warranty expenses the increase in income tax liabilities was primarily driven by the onetime deemed repatriation transition tax liability recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 

 

for the year ended december 31 2019 net cash used in investing activities was 1671 million primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of 958 million net purchases of shortterm investments of 768 million and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of 31 million these cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from sales of property and equipment of 93 million for the year ended december 31 2018 net cash used in investing activities was 147 million primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of 225 million and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of 41 million which was partially offset by net sales of investments of 119 million for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash used in investing activities was 1341 million primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of 658 million net purchases of shortterm investments of 630 million and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of 53 million

 

for the year ended december 31 2019 we funded the purchases of properties in kirkland washington and livonia michigan for 574 million we did not purchase any significant properties for the year ended december 31 2018 for the year ended december 31 2017 we funded the purchases of land in kirkland washington office space in shanghai and hangzhou china and land and office space in taipei taiwan for 538 million

 

for the year ended december 31 2019 net cash used in financing activities was 481 million primarily reflecting 673 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus which was partially offset by 199 million of cash proceeds from the vesting of rsus and the issuance of shares through our espp for the year ended december 31 2018 net cash used in financing activities was 346 million primarily reflecting 475 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus which was partially offset by 136 million of cash proceeds from the vesting of rsus and the issuance of shares through our espp for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash used in financing activities was 313 million primarily reflecting 339 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus which was partially offset by 29 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and the issuance of shares through our espp

 

in february 2020 our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividends from 040 per share to 050 per share

 

we anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments as well as payments for the onetime deemed repatriation transition tax and other expenditures will come from our domestic cash cash generated from ongoing us operations and cash repatriated from our bermuda subsidiary earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested

 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and shortterm investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months 

 

in the future in order to strengthen our financial position respond to changes in our circumstance or unforeseen events or conditions or fund our growth we may need to discontinue paying dividends and dividend equivalents and may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities issuing debt or convertible debt securities incurring indebtedness secured by our assets or selling certain product lines andor portions of our business accordingly we cannot ensure that we will continue to pay dividends and dividend equivalents in the future and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all

 

from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines technologies businesses and companies and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities assumptions of debt andor payment of cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisitions through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by management and approved by our board of directors such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities based on our investment positions as of december 31 2019 a 10 decline in interest rates would impact our results of operations by approximately 07 million in interest income

 

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale which are reported at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders’ equity when the fair value of an investment is below its amortized cost basis no realized losses are recognized in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates ie noncredit loss factors unless we have the intent to sell the securities or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis

 

 

longterm investments 

 

as of december 31 2019 our holdings in auctionrate securities had a face value of 34 million and a fair value of 31 million the decline in the fair value could impact our operating results by 02 million if we have the intent to sell the securities it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or the decline in value is related to credit loss factors an additional 10 decline in the fair value could further impact our operating results by 03 million to date we have redeemed 400 million or 92 of the original portfolio in these securities at par without any realized losses

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

our sales outside the united states are primarily transacted in us dollars through our subsidiary in bermuda accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes the functional currency of the company’s offshore operations is generally the local currency primarily including the renminbi the new taiwan dollar and the euro in addition we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain intercompany transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency gains or losses from the settlement and remeasurement of the balances are reported in interest and other income net fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations in any of the periods presented

 item 9a controls and procedures 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

 

based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2019 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control—integrated framework   2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2019 management reviewed the results of its assessment with our audit committee

 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as stated in the firm’s attestation report which appears in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

effective january 1 2019 we adopted asu no 201602 leases topic 842  we have implemented additional business processes and control activities primarily related to the analysis of lease contracts recognition of the rou assets and lease liabilities and presentation and disclosure in order to monitor and maintain appropriate controls over financial reporting there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2019 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 

limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures 

 

in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs

industry overview 

 

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or integrated circuits “ics” in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world to digital systems

 

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for high performance analog and mixedsignal ics high performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixedsignal ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market from digital ic markets these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer aboveaverage growth over the long term compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole

  

end markets and applications 

 

we currently target our products in the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets with the consumer market representing the largest portion of our revenue the following is a summary of the various applications of our products in each end market and such markets contribution as a percentage of our total revenue 

 

  

 

product families 

 

our proprietary process technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller singlechip power management ics these technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of analog applications within the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets our product families are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions our key product families include the following

 

direct current dc to dc products dc to dc ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers and monitors automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc products are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current high switching speed and small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices the dc to dc product family accounted for 92 92 and 90 of our total revenue in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively   

 

lighting control products lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers monitors car navigation systems and televisions backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps the lighting control product family accounted for 8 8 and 10 of our total revenue in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

 

in the future we plan to continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as expand our newer product families our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of china taiwan and other asian markets expand our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity

 

customers sales and marketing 

 

we sell our products through thirdparty distributors valueadded resellers and directly to original equipment manufacturers “oems” original design manufacturers “odms” and electronic manufacturing service “ems” providers our thirdparty distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors sell our products to end customers which include oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers 

 

sales to our largest distributor accounted for 22 of our total revenue in 2018 17 in 2017 and 22 in 2016 in addition one other distributor accounted for 10 of our total revenue in 2018 and one other distributor accounted for 10 of our total revenue in 2017 no other distributors or end customers accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in any of the periods presented

 

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor has the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 60 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements

 

we have sales offices located in china india japan korea singapore taiwan the united states and europe our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems’ electronics containing our products

 

because our sales are primarily billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because a majority of our revenue is attributable to sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 our revenue from sales to customers in asia was 88 89 and 91 respectively

 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped because orders in backlog are subject to cancellation or postponement and backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues

 

 

our manufacturing lead times are generally 8 to 16 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount take a significant writedown or dispose of it altogether all of which would negatively affect our profit margins

 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term

 

research and development 

 

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in china spain and the united states with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies

 

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products in the area of process technology we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technology is a key strategic component to our future growth 

 

patents and intellectual property matters 

 

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies

 

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of december 31 2018 we had 1133 patentsapplications issued or pending of which 402 patents have been issued in the united states our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2038 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers or could pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products are found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows

  

 

manufacturing 

 

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ics this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technologies and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our ics

 

we currently contract with four suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china and korea once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort which is a testing process performed to identify nonfunctioning dies our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in china and malaysia the assembled ics are then sent either for final testing at our chengdu facility or to other turnkey providers who perform final testing based on our standards prior to shipping to our customers

 

we have a 60000 squarefoot manufacturing facility located in chengdu china the facility has been fully operational since 2006 and we have benefitted from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs we have expanded our product testing capabilities in this facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations

 

key personnel and employees 

 

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2018 we employed 1737 employees primarily located in asia europe and the united states compared with 1534 employees as of december 31 2017

 

competition 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and in some cases have a broader product offerings that may enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least ten manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices infineon technologies maxim integrated products nxp semiconductors on semiconductor power integrations renesas electronics rohm semiconductor semtech and texas instruments

 

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however there is no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market in addition there has recently been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry if these or future acquisitions are successful competition may intensify and our competitors may have additional resources to compete against us

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business involves numerous risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements

   

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

 

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including

 

  

 

  

  

 

in addition the stock market often experiences substantial volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

 

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year over year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

 

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including

 

  

  

 

  

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline and be volatile

 

our business has been and may be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions in particular changing economic conditions in china 

 

in recent years global credit and financial markets experienced disruptions and may experience disruptions in the future including diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability economic uncertainty affects businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish liquidity and capital availability

 

demand for our products is a function of the health of the economies in the united states europe china and the rest of asia we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic disruption or subsequent economic recovery worldwide in the united states in our industry or in the different markets that we serve these and other economic factors have had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results

 

in particular since we have significant operations in china our business development plans results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by significant political social and economic developments in china a slowdown in economic growth in china could adversely impact our customers prospective customers suppliers distributors and partners in china which could have a material adverse effect on our results of the operations and financial condition there is no guarantee that economic downturns whether actual or perceived any further decrease in economic growth rates or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook in china will not occur or persist in the future that they will not be protracted or that governments will respond adequately to control and reverse such conditions any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall any significant or prolonged downturns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows

  

rising concern of international tariffs including tariffs applied to goods traded between the united states and china could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

since the beginning of 2018 there has been increasing rhetoric in some cases coupled with legislative or executive action from several us and foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials more specifically there have been three rounds of us tariffs on chinese goods taking effect in july august and september 2018 some of which prompted retaliatory chinese tariffs on us goods the institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the us and china specifically carries the risk of negatively affecting china’s overall economic condition which could have a negative impact on us as we have significant operations in china furthermore imposition of tariffs could cause a decrease in the sales of our products to customers located in china or other customers selling to chinese end users which would directly impact our business and operating results

 

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

 

our profitability is dependent on many factors including

 

  

 

  

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in our operations including any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability

 

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

 

in the past our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products we are subject to numerous risks and factors that could cause a decrease in our growth rates compared to past periods including increased competition loss of certain of our customers unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand a deterioration in market conditions endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and litigation a material decrease in our growth rates could adversely affect our stock price and results of operations   

 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

 

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above industry averages should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

  

in recent years there has been a trend toward semiconductor industry consolidation we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to improve the leverage of growing research and development costs strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry or become unable to continue operations unless they find an acquirer or consolidate with another company in addition companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that semiconductor industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

 

 

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

 

we believe that the application of our products in the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected

 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

 

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors

 

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets

 

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including

 

  

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

 

we may face competition from customers developing products internally 

  

our customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources some customers have traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of thirdparty sourcing for products as an alternative to inhouse development customers may in the future continue to use internally developed components they also may decide to develop or acquire components technologies or products that are similar to or that may be substituted for our products if our customers fail to accept our products as an alternative if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

 

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

 

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct sales or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and valueadded reseller agreements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2018 88 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including

 

  

  

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and financial condition

 

we depend on a limited number of customers including distributors for a significant percentage of our revenue 

 

historically we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers including distributors for example sales to our largest distributor accounted for 22 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenue a decrease in demand or significant pricing pressure for our products from any of our major customers for any reason including due to competition market conditions catastrophic events or otherwise could have a materially adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations

 

 

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which place us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by the us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

   

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements valueadded resellers and direct customers and the loss of any one of these distributors valueadded resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

 

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and ems providers receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible sales to our largest distributor accounted for 22 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply commitments 

 

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an end customer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or an oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

 

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

 

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  as a result this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations delays in increasing thirdparty manufacturing capacity may also limit our ability to meet customer demand

 

 

we currently depend on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable andor fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

 

we have a supply arrangement with certain suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue

 

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management of the supplier relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

 

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows

 

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

 

we do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as global economic crises may materially impact our assembly suppliers’ ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our thirdparty suppliers’ manufacturing capacity 

 

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops and testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities such activities are subject to a number of risks including

 

  

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty suppliers’ capacity

 

 

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

 

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from thirdparty manufacturers in advance of selling our products we place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the timeframe that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigation or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be written down or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position

 

the 2017 tax act will continue to have significant effects on our income tax expense which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

in december 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted and includes a broad range of tax reforms including changes to the corporate tax rate business deductions and international tax provisions many of these provisions significantly differ from prior us tax law resulting in material tax accounting implications for us some of the significant new requirements include but are not limited to a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings a remeasurement of our deferred taxes due to the change in the corporate tax rate taxation of certain global intangible lowtaxed income under the international tax provisions and limitations on the deductibility of performancebased compensation for officers any increase in our income tax expense as a result of the 2017 tax act could have a material negative impact on our results of operations in addition the deemed repatriation transition tax liability which is payable in installments over eight years will adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition in future periods any changes to our corporate tax planning and strategies may not result in a favorable impact on our income tax expense in future periods

 

the calculation of the tax impact under the 2017 tax act is complex it requires the collection and analysis of extensive information the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment in determining our tax provision as we continue to evaluate our existing processes and controls necessary to address the financial reporting effects of the 2017 tax act we also expect further guidance may be forthcoming from the financial accounting standards board “fasb” and the sec as well as regulations interpretations and rulings from federal and state tax agencies if we fail to correctly interpret the tax law or implement effective internal controls on gathering analyzing and reviewing data used in our calculations our income tax provision could be misstated which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

  

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

 

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision including the effects of the 2017 tax act we engage thirdparty tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which if material would result in us having to restate our financial statements restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations damage our reputation andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or by changes in tax laws such as the 2017 tax act regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items such as vesting of restricted stock units in addition we are subject to potential future examinations of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

   

implementation of an enterprise resource planning “erp” or other information technology systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations 

 

from time to time we may implement new erp software solutions or upgrade existing systems implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of system providers and internal business teams we may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes including loss or corruption of financial business or customer data in addition transitioning to these new systems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or any significant system failures could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources financial condition or results of operations

 

 

system security risks data protection or privacy breaches cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations andor harm our reputation and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue increase our expenses negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price 

 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution financial reporting or other critical functions

 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data on our internal systems network and servers such as proprietary business and financial information and confidential data pertaining to our customers suppliers and business partners the secure maintenance of sensitive information on our networks and the protection features of our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy we devote significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data however these security measures cannot provide absolute security although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and solutions any destructive or intrusive breach could compromise our networks creating system disruptions or slowdowns and the information stored on our networks could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen if any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data our relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially damaged our reputation could be materially harmed and we could be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible significant liability

 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and our remediation efforts may be expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation

 

if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

 

from time to time we are a party to various legal proceedings if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be significant we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products and our products and our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings

 

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publicly disclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

 

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in us incurring unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be materially impacted

 

future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses our financial condition could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time and effort to these legal proceedings which could divert management’s attention from focusing on our operations and adversely affect our business

 

 

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business 

 

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities has suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

 

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities became illiquid in 2008 since 2008 we have redeemed 92 of the original portfolio of our auctionrate securities at par and continue to hold 36 million in principal amount as of december 31 2018 the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 28 years we have historically recorded temporary and otherthantemporary impairment charges on these investments the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the quality of underlying collateral estimated time for liquidity including potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty and market conditions among others should there be further deterioration in the market for auctionrate securities the value of our portfolio may decline which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our results of operations if management determines the decline in value to be otherthantemporary if the accounting rules for these securities change there may be an adverse impact on our earnings 

 

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting 

 

effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct our business and operating results could be harmed our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and could subject us to stockholder litigation in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

 

our products must meet specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

 

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet ics as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is generally one to two years which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results

 

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims

 

the price and availability of commodities eg gold copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

our products incorporate commodities such as gold copper and silicon an increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations

 

 

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the renminbi may adversely affect results of operations 

 

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future if the value of the renminbi rises against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition our sales are primarily denominated in the us dollar if the value of the us dollar rises against other currencies it may adversely affect the demand for our products in international markets which could negatively impact our business and results of operations

 

we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the timing of payments for transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries which are reported in interest and other income in the statements of operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the amount of foreign currency exchange losses we record which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations

 

our business is subject to various governmental laws and regulations and compliance with these regulations may impact our revenue and cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations or obtain government licenses and approvals for our desired international trading activities or technology transfers we may be forced to recall products and cease their distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

 

our business is subject to various significant laws and other legal requirements imposed by the us and other countries we conduct business with including export control laws such as the export administration act the export administration regulations ear and other laws regulations and requirements governing international trade and technology transfer these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend sales to these customers which could negatively impact our results of operations we must conform the manufacture and distribution of our products to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in many countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products we could be required to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products are brought into compliance

 

environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations 

  

we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of certain products such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate including various european union member countries and countries in asia there can be no assurance that similar laws and regulations will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs possible delays in delivering products and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future products if the cost were to become prohibitive

 

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

 

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china and most of our manufacturing partners are located in china the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china additionally china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies

 

personal privacy cyber security and data protection are becoming increasingly significant issues in china to address these issues the standing committee of the national people’s congress promulgated the cyber security law of the people’s republic of china the “cyber security law” which took effect on june 1 2017 the cyber security law sets forth various requirements relating to the collection use storage disclosure and security of data among other things various chinese agencies are expected to issue additional regulations in the future to define these requirements more precisely these requirements may increase our costs of compliance we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of these regulatory requirements   any failure to comply with the cyber security law and the relevant regulations and policies could result in further cost and liability to us and could adversely affect our business and results of operations additionally increased costs to comply with and other burdens imposed by the cyber security law and relevant regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our suppliers vendors and other service providers as well as our customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations

 

 

any additional new regulations or the amendment or modification of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results

 

the chinese government and provincial and local governments also have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facilities in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to us and our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing and testing facilities in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

 

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china we face the following risks among others with respect to our operations in china

 

  

if we are unable to maintain our facilities in china at fully operational status with qualified workers appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected

  

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and could do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profits 

 

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own wafer manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our profit margins

 

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

 

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures may be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it generally takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons including

 

  

 

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

 

our success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

 

our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development we expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and introduce new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability if we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results also if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources we could see material adverse effects on our business financial condition and operating results

 

in addition if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development

 

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could affect our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands of our business including design cycles our business could be harmed furthermore if we lose key personnel the search for a qualified replacement and the transition could interrupt our operations as the search could take us longer than expected and divert management resources and the newly hired employee could take longer than expected to integrate into the team

 

if we fail to retain key employees in our sales applications finance and legal staff or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

 

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal staff maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal control that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected

 

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

 

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships andor acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed

 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire in addition acquisitions could result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders reduce our cash balances and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities which could adversely affect our business we may also be the target of strategic transactions which could divert our management’s attention and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business 

 

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities as a result of completing acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership or incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities such actions could impact our operating results and the price of our common stock 

 

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings

 

we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with

 

  

in addition third parties may be interested in acquiring us we will consider and discuss such transactions as we deem appropriate such potential transactions may diver the attention of management and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in investigating and evaluating such transactions whether or not they are consummated

  

if we issue additional shares of stock in the future it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 

  

we may issue additional shares of common stock in the future in order to raise additional capital to fund our global operations or in connection with an acquisition we also issue restricted stock units to employees which convert into shares of common stock upon vesting any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate dilution to our stockholders in addition the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may result in additional regulatory requirements such as stockholder approval

 

 

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with many manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate 

 

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition

 

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

  

in june 2014 the board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock the declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

 

our office in california the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer suppliers our ic testing and manufacturing facilities a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia particularly in china such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k

 

overview 

 

we are a leading semiconductor company that designs develops and markets highperformance power solutions incorporated in 1997 mps’s core strengths include deep systemlevel and applications knowledge strong analog design expertise and an innovative proprietary process technology these combined strengths enable mps to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energy efficient costeffective easytouse solutions for systems found in computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer applications our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers systems with green practical and compact solutions we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families as well as in new innovative product categories

 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products we are not immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term

 

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ics this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths

 

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult

 

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia where our products are incorporated into enduser products for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 our revenue from sales to customers in asia was 88 89 and 91 respectively we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter products which serve the computing and storage automotive industrial communications and consumer markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation inventories income taxes valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

 

revenue recognition 

 

we generate revenue primarily from product sales which include assembled and tested integrated circuits as well as dies in wafer form these product sales were 98 98 and 99 of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the remaining revenue primarily includes royalty revenue from licensing arrangements and revenue from wafer testing services performed for third parties which have not been significant in all periods presented 

 

 

we recognize revenue from product sales when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services

 

product sales consist of a single performance obligation that we satisfy at a point in time we recognize product revenue from distributors and direct end customers when the following events have occurred a we have transferred physical possession of the products b we have a present right to payment c the customer has legal title to the products and d the customer bears significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the contracts these criteria are generally met when the products are shipped from our facilities such as the “ex works” shipping term or delivered to the customers’ locations such as the “delivered duty paid” shipping term

 

under certain consignment agreements revenue is not recognized when the products are shipped and delivered to be held at customers’ designated locations because we continue to control the products and retain ownership and the customers do not have an unconditional obligation to pay we recognize revenue when the customers pull the products from the locations or in some cases after a 60day period from the delivery date has passed at which time control transfers to the customers and we invoice them for payment

 

we account for price adjustment and stock rotation rights as variable consideration that reduces the transaction price and recognize that reduction in the same period the associated revenue is recognized three usbased distributors have price adjustment rights when they sell our products to their end customers at a price that is lower than the distribution price invoiced by us when we receive claims from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers at the lower price we issue the distributors credit memos for the price adjustments we estimate the price adjustments based on an analysis of historical claims at both the distributor and product level as well as an assessment of any known trends of product sales mix other us distributors and nonus distributors which make up the majority of our total sales to distributors do not have price adjustment rights

 

in addition certain distributors have limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases in accordance with the contract terms we estimate the stock rotation returns based on an analysis of historical returns and the current level of inventory in the distribution channel we recognize an asset for product returns which represents the right to recover products from the customers related to stock rotations with a corresponding reduction to cost of revenue

  we pay sales commissions based on the achievement of predetermined product sales targets as we recognize product sales at a point in time sales commissions are expensed as incurred

   

inventory valuation 

 

we value our inventories at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or their current estimated net realizable value we write down excess and obsolete inventories based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required conversely if actual demand or market conditions are more favorable inventories may be sold that were previously reserved 

 

valuation of goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

we evaluate intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist we perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist impairment of intangible assets is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the assets and their carrying value impairment for goodwill occurs if the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill is less than its carrying value and is recognized based on the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill the assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and revenue forecasts if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future including macroeconomic and market conditions we may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets

  

accounting for income taxes 

  

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized

 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure

 

 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted which significantly changed us corporate income tax law the 2017 tax act made the following material changes 1 reduction of the corporate income tax rate effective january 1 2018 2 replacement of the worldwide tax system with a territorial tax regime with a onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings 3 amendment on the deductibility of executive performancebased compensation and 4 creation of new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings income tax effects resulting from changes in tax laws are accounted for in the period in which the law is enacted as permitted by staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” issued by the sec on december 22 2017 we recorded provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates for the year ended december 31 2017 with a oneyear measurement period to complete the analysis any subsequent adjustments to these provisional amounts would be recorded to the income tax provision in the period when the analysis was complete in december 2018 we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 tax act including the calculation of the deemed repatriation transition tax see the “income tax provision” for further discussion

 

as of december 31 2018 and 2017 we had a valuation allowance of 130 million and 126 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the fourth quarter of 2017 management assessed the realizability of the deferred tax assets and concluded that a full valuation allowance would no longer be needed on the federal deferred tax assets due principally to the enactment of the 2017 tax act as a result we released 216 million of valuation allowance which was recorded as a benefit in the income tax provision in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize other deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax assets valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made

 

contingencies 

 

we are a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business including potential litigation regarding our shareholders and our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and employment matters the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations

  

stockbased compensation 

  

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award   the fair value of restricted stock units “rsus” with service conditions or performance conditions is based on the grant date share price the fair value of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan and rsus with a purchase price feature is estimated using the blackscholes model the fair value of rsus with market conditions as well as rsus containing both market and performance conditions is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model 

 

compensation expense related to awards with service conditions is recorded on a straightline basis over the requisite service period compensation expense related to awards subject to market or performance conditions is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche for awards with only market conditions compensation expense is not reversed if the market conditions are not satisfied for awards with performance conditions as well as awards containing both market and performance conditions we recognize compensation expense when the performance goals are achieved or when it becomes probable that the performance goals will be achieved management performs the probability assessment on a quarterly basis by reviewing external factors such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry revenue forecasts and internal factors such as our business and operational objectives and revenue forecasts changes in the probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catchup adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date if the projected achievement was revised upward or if the actual results were higher than the projected achievement additional compensation expense would be recorded for the awards due to the cumulative catchup adjustment which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations conversely if the projected achievement was revised downward or if the actual results were lower than the projected achievement previously accrued compensation expense would be reversed for the awards which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations as a result our stockbased compensation expense is subject to volatility and may fluctuate significantly each quarter due to changes in our probability assessment or actual results being different from projections made by management

 

 

we account for forfeitures of equity awards when they occur

litigation expense benefit net 

 

litigation expense was 19 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared with 12 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily due to increased expenses on an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff

 

litigation expense was 12 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared with a litigation benefit net of 02 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase in litigation expense was primarily due to an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff in addition we did not recognize any litigation benefit for the year ended december 31 2017 compared with 07 million of benefit recognized in connection with two litigation settlements for the year ended december 31 2016

 

interest and other income net 

 

interest and other income net was 50 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared with 55 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the decrease was primarily due to an increase of 36 million in expenses related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments this decrease was partially offset by an increase of 15 million in foreign currency exchange gain an increase of 10 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields and a decrease of 06 million in amortization of premium on availableforsale securities

income tax provision 

 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2018 was 132 million or 112 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in bermuda and china was taxed at lower rates in addition the effective tax rate was impacted by the inclusion of the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provisions as a result of the 2017 tax act

 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2017 was 177 million or 214 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in bermuda and china was taxed at lower rates and because of the stockbased compensation in addition the effective tax rate was impacted by the effects of the 2017 tax act including the remeasurement of deferred taxes and the onetime deemed repatriation transition tax and the release of the us valuation allowance 

 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2016 was 45 million or 79 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in bermuda and china was taxed at lower rates in addition the effective tax rate was impacted by changes in valuation allowance and the stockbased compensation

 

2017 tax act  

 

under accounting standards codification “asc” no 740 income taxes  the effects of a new legislation are recognized upon enactment accordingly we were required to recognize the tax effects of the 2017 tax act beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017

 

on december 22 2017 the sec issued sab 118 which addressed the application of asc no 740 in situations when a registrant did not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 tax act in accordance with sab 118 for matters that have not been completed we would recognize provisional amounts to the extent that they were reasonably estimable any subsequent adjustments to the provisional amounts would be recorded to the income tax provision in the period when the analysis was complete we were permitted to finalize the analysis within a oneyear measurement period

 

as of december 31 2017 we had not completed the accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 tax act and recorded certain provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates in december 2018 we finalized the analysis of the 2017 tax act and recorded certain adjustments to the provisional amounts as discussed further below

 

 

we expect further guidance may be forthcoming from the fasb and the sec as well as regulations interpretations and rulings from federal and state tax agencies which could result in additional impact and adjustments to our income tax provisions in future periods 

 

corporate tax rate and remeasurement of deferred taxes 

 

the 2017 tax act reduces the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 because asc no 740 requires the effect of a change in tax laws to be recognized as of the date of enactment we remeasured our deferred tax balance as of december 22 2017 and recorded a provisional amount of 98 million to the income tax provision as a result of the remeasurement for the year ended december 31 2017 in december 2018 we finalized the analysis and did not make any adjustment to the provisional amount recorded for the year ended december 31 2017

  

dee med repatriation transition tax 

 

the 2017 tax act mandates a onetime deemed repatriation transition tax of post1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits “ep” on which us income taxes were previously deferred for the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded a provisional amount of 419 million related to the transition tax expense after the utilization of rd tax credits of 180 million the provisional transition tax liability was 239 million in december 2018 we finalized the analysis of the transition tax and recorded an increase of 13 million to the transition tax expense and a net increase of 07 million to the transition tax liability

 

as permitted by the 2017 tax act we have elected to pay the transition tax liability of 246 million in installments on an interestfree basis over eight years through 2025 for the year ended december 31 2018 we paid 26 million of the transition tax as of december 31 2018 13 million of the remaining transition tax was recorded in current accrued liabilities and 207 million was recorded in longterm income tax liabilities

 

undistr ibuted earnings of subsidiaries 

 

we previously considered the earnings in our nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly recorded no deferred income taxes prior to the transition tax we had an excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries including undistributed foreign earnings of 3902 million while the transition tax resulted in the reduction of the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries and subjected 1232 million of undistributed foreign earnings to tax an actual repatriation from our nonus subsidiaries could be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state taxes

 

we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and have determined that we plan to repatriate cash from our bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund our future us based expenditures and dividends for the other foreign subsidiaries we expect to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings to fund foreign operations and their research and development as of december 31 2018 we recorded deferred taxes liabilities of 11 million related to california state taxes which were netted against deferred tax assets

 

gilti 

  

the 2017 tax act subjects a us parent shareholder to taxation of its gilti effective january 1 2018 the gilti inclusions impact companies that have foreign earnings generated without a large aggregate foreign fixed asset base and whose earnings are being taxed at a low tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 we included 811 million related to the gilti provisions as additional subpart f income which was accounted for as a period cost

 

ex ecutive compensation deduction 

 

the 2017 tax act retains the 1 million limitation on deductible compensation to covered employees which include the chief executive officer and four other highest paid officers under irc section 162m however it eliminates the exception for performancebased cash or stock compensation and expands the definition of covered employees to include the chief financial officer accordingly beginning january 1 2018 the deductible compensation to covered employees is generally subject to the 1 million limitation

  

 

release of valuation allowance 

  

management periodically evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence the realizability of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax attributes to fully utilize these assets we maintained a full valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets as of the third quarter of 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we assessed the realizability of the deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets would be realizable due principally to the enactment of the 2017 tax act in accordance with asc no 740 management considered all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was needed our conclusion was primarily driven by the following positive evidence

 

    

as a result we released 216 million of valuation allowance on federal deferred tax assets which was recorded as a benefit in the income tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2017 we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in california primarily due to a low apportionment factor and the amount of rd tax credits generated is greater than the amount utilized

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  

as of december 31 2018 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1727 million and shortterm investments of 2046 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of 828 million and shortterm investments of 2163 million as of december 31 2017 as of december 31 2018 1438 million of cash and cash equivalents and 1010 million of shortterm investments were held by our international subsidiaries as a result of the enactment of the 2017 tax act we currently plan to repatriate cash from our bermuda subsidiary to fund our future expenditures in the us earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested see the income tax provision section for further discussion

 

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable inventories and other current assets reduced by accounts payable accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities as of december 31 2018 we had working capital of 5004 million compared with working capital of 3833 million as of december 31 2017 the 1171 million increase in working capital was due to a 1316 million increase in current assets which was partially offset by a 145 million increase in current liabilities the increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and inventories the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities

 

summary of cash flows 

 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities

 

  

 

for the year ended december 31 2018 net cash provided by operating activities was 1415 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation and a net decrease of 375 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by increased sales the increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan

 

for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash provided by operating activities was 1338 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and deferred taxes and a net increase of 157 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in deferred taxes was primarily due to the release of the us valuation allowance partially offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax balance in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the 2017 tax act the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by higher sales the increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan and warranty expenses the increase in income tax liabilities was primarily driven by the onetime deemed repatriation transition tax liability recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 

 

for the year ended december 31 2016 net cash provided by operating activities was 1078 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation and a net decrease of 29 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in other assets was primarily due to a prepaid wafer purchase agreement we funded during the year the increase in inventories was primarily driven by increased purchases to meet current demand and future growth the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan 

 

for the year ended december 31 2018 net cash used in investing activities was 147 million primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of 225 million and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of 41 million which was partially offset by net sales of investments of 119 million for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash used in investing activities was 1341 million primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of 658 million net purchases of shortterm investments of 630 million and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of 53 million for the year ended december 31 2016 net cash used in investing activities was 557 million primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of 371 million net purchases of investments of 136 million and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of 50 million 

 

we did not purchase any significant properties for the year ended december 31 2018 for the year ended december 31 2017 we funded the purchases of land in kirkland washington office space in shanghai and hangzhou china and land and office space in taipei taiwan for 538 million for the year ended december 31 2016 we funded the purchases of a previously leased manufacturing facility in chengdu china office space in shenzhen china and land and office space in taipei taiwan for 175 million

 

for the year ended december 31 2018 net cash used in financing activities was 346 million primarily reflecting 475 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus which was partially offset by 136 million of cash proceeds from vesting of rsus and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash used in financing activities was 313 million primarily reflecting 339 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus which was partially offset by 29 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december 31 2016 net cash used in financing activities was 281 million primarily reflecting 331 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus which was partially offset by 38 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan 

 

we have a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock in addition outstanding rsu awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents which entitle employees who hold rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock the dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying rsus vest dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying rsus are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement and the awards do not vest for the year ended december 31 2018 we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling 475 million for the year ended december 31 2017 we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling 339 million for the year ended december 31 2016 we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling 331 million 

 

in february 2019 our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividends from 030 per share to 040 per share effective for the dividends declared in the first quarter of 2019

 

we anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments as well as payments for the onetime deemed repatriation transition tax and other expenditures will come from our current domestic cash cash generated from ongoing us operations and cash to be repatriated from our bermuda subsidiary earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested

 

 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and shortterm investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months 

 

in the future in order to strengthen our financial position respond to changes in our circumstance or unforeseen events or conditions or fund our growth we may need to discontinue paying dividends and dividend equivalents and may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities issuing debt or convertible debt securities incurring indebtedness secured by our assets or selling certain product lines andor portions of our business accordingly we cannot ensure that we will continue to pay dividends and dividend equivalents in the future and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all

 

from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines technologies businesses and companies and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities assumptions of debt andor payment of cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisitions through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 

 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2018

 

  

 

  

     

in february 2019 we entered into an agreement to purchase an office building and land located in kirkland washington for 530 million in cash we expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2019

 

off balance sheet arrangements 

 

as of december 31 2018 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of the securities and exchange commission’s regulation sk

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by management and approved by our board of directors such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities based on our investment positions as of december 31 2018 and 2017 a 10 decline in interest rates would impact our results of operations by approximately 06 million and 05 million in interest income respectively

 

 

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale no realized gains or losses are recognized in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired availableforsale investments are reported at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders’ equity

 

longterm investments 

 

as of december 31 2018 and 2017 our holdings in auctionrate securities had a face value of 36 million and 56 million and a fair value of 32 million and 53 million respectively as of december 31 2018 and 2017 a 10 decline in the fair value could impact our results of operations by approximately 04 million and 05 million respectively if we determined the decline in value to be otherthantemporary to date we have redeemed 92 of the original portfolio in these securities or 397 million at par without any realized losses

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

our sales outside the united states are primarily transacted in us dollars through our subsidiary in bermuda accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes the functional currency of the company’s offshore operations is generally the local currency primarily including the renminbi the new taiwan dollar and the euro in addition we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain intercompany transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency gains or losses from the settlement and remeasurement of the balances are reported in interest and other income net fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations in any of the periods presented

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

 

based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2018 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control—integrated framework   2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2018 management reviewed the results of its assessment with our audit committee

 

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  we have implemented additional business processes and control activities primarily related to variable consideration estimates and presentation and disclosure in order to monitor and maintain appropriate controls over financial reporting there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2018 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   

 

limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures 

 

in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs

industry overview 

 

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or integrated circuits “ics” in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world to digital systems

 

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for high performance analog and mixedsignal ics high performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixedsignal ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market from digital ic markets these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer aboveaverage growth over the long term compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole 

  

end markets and applications 

 

we currently target our products in the consumer computing and storage industrial automotive and communications markets with the consumer market representing the largest portion of our revenue the following is a brief summary of the various applications of our products in each end market and such markets contribution as a percentage of our total revenue   

 

   

 

product families 

 

our proprietary process technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller singlechip power management ics these technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of analog applications within the consumer computing and storage industrial automotive and communications markets our product families are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions our key product families include the following 

 

direct current dc to dc products   dc to dc ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers and monitors automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc products are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current high switching speed and small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices the dc to dc product family accounted for 92 90 and 90 of our total revenue in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively   

    

lighting control products lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers monitors car navigation systems and televisions backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps in addition to alternating currentdirect current or acdc offline solutions for lighting illumination applications we also offer acdc power conversion solutions for a diverse number of end products that plug into a wall outlet the lighting control product family accounted for 8 10 and 10 of our total revenue in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

 

in the future we plan to continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as expand our newer product families our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of china taiwan and other asian markets expand our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity

 

customers sales and marketing 

 

we sell our products through thirdparty distributors valueadded resellers and directly to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms and electronic manufacturing service ems providers our thirdparty distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors sell our products to end customers which include oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers 

 

sales to our largest distrib utor accounted for 17 of our total revenue in 2017 22 in 2016 and 24 in 2015 in addition one other distributor accounted for 10 of our total revenue in 2017 no other distributors or end customers accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in any of the periods presented 

 

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor has the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

    

we have sales offices located in china india japan korea singapore taiwan the united states and europe our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems’ electronics containing our products 

 

because our sales are primarily billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because a majority of our revenue is attributable to sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 our revenue from sales to customers in asia was 89 91 and 91 respectively 

 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped because orders in backlog are subject to cancellation or postponement and backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues 

 

 

our manufacturing lead times are generally 8 to 16 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount take a significant writedown or dispose of it altogether all of which would negatively affect our profit margins

 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term

 

research and development 

 

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in the united states and china with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies

 

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers ’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products in the area of process technology we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technology is a key strategic component to our future growth 

 

our research and development expenses totaled 824 million 736 million and 658 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

  

patents and intellectual property matters 

 

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies

 

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of december 31 2017 we had 1145 patentsapplications issued or pending of which 360 patents have been issued in the united states our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2037 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products  could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers or could pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products are found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

manufacturing 

 

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ics this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technologies and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our ics

 

we currently contract with four suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china and korea once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort which is a testing process performed to identify nonfunctioning dies our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in china and malaysia the assembled ics are then sent either for final testing at our chengdu facility or to other turnkey providers who perform final testing based on our standards prior to shipping to our customers

 

in september 2004 we entered into a lease arrangement for a 60000 squarefoot manufacturing facility located in chengdu china in september 2015 we exercised our option to purchase the facility and the transaction was completed in january 2016 the facility has been fully operational since 2006 and we have benefitted from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs compared to our operations prior to the use of the facility we have expanded our product testing capabilities in this facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations in addition we constructed a 150000 squarefoot research and development facility in chengdu china which was put into operation in october 2010

 

key personnel and employees 

 

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2017 we employed 1534 employees primarily located in china india japan korea singapore taiwan the united states and europe compared with 1417 employees as of december 31 2016 

 

competition 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and in some cases have a broader product offerings that may enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices infineon technologies intersil acquired by renesas electronics in 2017 linear technology acquired by analog devices in 2017 maxim integrated products nxp semiconductors pending acquisition by qualcomm on semiconductor power integrations rohm semiconductor semtech and texas instruments 

 

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however there is no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market in addition there has recently been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry if these or future acquisitions are successful competition may intensify and our competitors may have additional resources to compete against us

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business involves numerous risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements 

    

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

    

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including

 

  

  

  

  

     

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

     

  

  

  

  

  

 

     

  

  

  

  

  

in addition the stock market often experiences substantial volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

 

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year over year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

 

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

     

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline and be volatile

 

our business has been and may be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions 

 

in recent years global credit and financial markets experienced disruptions and may experience disruptions in the future including diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability economic uncertainty affects businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish liquidity and capital availability demand for our products is a function of the health of the economies in the united states europe china and the rest of the world we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic disruption or subsequent economic recovery worldwide in the united states in our industry or in the different markets that we serve these and other economic factors have had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results

  

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

 

our profitability is dependent on many factors including

 

  

  

     

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in our operations including any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability

    

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

 

in the past our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products we are subject to numerous risks and factors that could cause a decrease in our growth rates compared to past periods including increased competition loss of certain of our customers unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and litigation a material decrease in our growth rates could adversely affect our stock price and results of operations

 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

  

in june 2014 the board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock the declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions statutory requirements of delaware law compliance with the terms of future indebtedness and credit facilities and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

 

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above industry averages should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected   

    

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows

 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

  

in recent years there has been a trend toward semiconductor industry consolidation we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to improve the leverage of growing research and development costs strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry or become unable to continue operations unless they find an acquirer or consolidate with another company in addition companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that semiconductor industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

 

 

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

 

we believe that the application of our products in the consumer computing and storage industrial automotive and communications markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

    

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

 

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors

 

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets

 

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

 

we may face competition from customers developing products internally 

  

our customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources some customers have traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of thirdparty sourcing for products as an alternative to inhouse development customers may in the future continue to use internally developed components they also may decide to develop or acquire components technologies or products that are similar to or that may be substituted for our products if our customers fail to accept our products as an alternative if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

 

 

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

 

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct sales or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and valueadded reseller agreements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2017 89 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and financial condition

    

we depend on a limited number of customers including distributors for a significant percentage of our revenue 

 

historically we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers including distributors for example sales to our largest distrib utor accounted for 17 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2017 we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenue a decrease in demand or significant pricing pressure for our products from any of our major customers for any reason including due to competition market conditions catastrophic events or otherwise could have a materially adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 

 

 

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which places us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by the us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

    

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements valueadded resellers and direct customers and the loss of any one of these distributors valueadded resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

 

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers “emss” receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible sales to our largest distrib utor accounted for 17 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2017 significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply commitments 

    

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer ’s or an oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

 

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers ’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

 

our ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

 

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  as a result this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations delays in increasing thirdparty manufacturing capacity may also limit our ability to meet customer demand 

 

 

we currently depend on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable andor fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

 

we have a supply arrangement with certain suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue

 

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers ’ continued cooperation and our management of the supplier relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

 

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows

    

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

 

we do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as global economic crises may materially impact our assembly suppliers’ ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our thirdparty suppliers ’ manufacturing capacity 

 

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops and testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities such activities are subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty suppliers ’ capacity 

    

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

 

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from thirdparty manufacturers in advance of selling our products we place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the timeframe that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigation or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be written down or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position

    

 

the 2017 tax act is expected to have significant effects on our income tax expense which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

in december 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted and includes a broad range of tax reforms including changes to corporate tax rates business deductions and international tax provisions many of these provisions significantly differ from prior us tax law resulting in material tax accounting implications for us some of the significant new requirements include but are not limited to a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings a remeasur ement of our deferred taxes due to the change in the corporate tax rate taxation of certain global intangible lowtaxed income under the international tax provisions and limitations on the deductibility of performancebased compensation for officers some of these provisions such as the deemed repatriation transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets had immediate accounting implications which resulted in a significant increase in our tax expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 as we continue to evaluate the potential implications of the 2017 tax act on our financial statements any increase in our income tax expense in future periods could have a material negative impact on our results of operations in addition the deemed repatriation transition tax liability which will be payable over eight years will adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition in future periods any changes to our corporate tax planning and strategies as a result of the 2017 tax act may not result in a favorable impact on our income tax expense in future periods 

 

the calculation of the tax impact and exposures under the 2017 tax act is complex it requires the collection of information not regularly produced by us the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment in determining our tax provision as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the 2017 tax act and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position furthermore we will need to evaluate whether changes to our existing processes and controls are necessary to address the financial reporting effects if we fail to correctly interpret the tax law or implement effective internal controls on gathering analyzing and reviewing data used in our calculations our income tax provision could be misstated which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

 

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision including the effects of the 2017 tax act we engage thirdparty tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which if material would result in us having to restate our financial statements restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations damage our reputation andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws such as the 2017 tax act regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items such as future exercises or dispositions of stock options and restricted stock releases in addition we are subject to potential future examinations of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities for example our us federal income tax returns for the years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2007 were examined by the irs we reached a resolution with the irs in april 2015 and recorded a onetime net charge of 27 million to our income tax provision in the second quarter of 2015 we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

implementation of an enterprise resource planning “erp” or other information technology systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations 

 

from time to time we may implement new erp software solutions or upgrade existing systems implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of system providers and internal business teams we may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes including loss or corruption of financial business or customer data in addition transitioning to these new systems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or significant system failures could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources financial condition or results of operations

 

 

system security risks data protection or privacy breaches cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations andor harm our reputation and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue increase our expenses negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price 

 

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions

 

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data on our internal systems network and servers such as proprietary business and financial information and confidential data pertaining to our customers suppliers and business partners the secure maintenance of sensitive information on our networks and the protection features of our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy we devote significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data however these security measures cannot provide absolute security although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and solutions any destructive or intrusive breach could compromise our networks creating system disruptions or slowdowns and the information stored on our networks could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen if any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data our relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially damaged our reputation could be materially harmed and we could be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible significant liability 

 

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and our remediation efforts may be expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation

 

if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys ’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

 

from time to time we are a party to various legal proceedings if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be significant we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products and our products and our customers ’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

 

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publicly disclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

 

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in us incurring unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be materially impacted

 

 

future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses our financial condition could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could divert management ’s attention from focusing on our operations and adversely affect our business 

    

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees ’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business 

 

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities has suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

 

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities became illiquid in 2008 since 2008 we have redeemed 87 of the original portfolio of our auctionrate securities at par and continue to hold 56 million in principal amount as of december 31 2017 it is unclear as to when the remaining balance of our auctionrate securities will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 30 years we have historically recorded temporary and otherthantemporary impairment charges on these investments the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the quality of underlying collateral estimated time for liquidity including potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty and market conditions among others should there be further deterioration in the market for auctionrate securities the value of our portfolio may decline which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our earnings if the accounting rules for these securities change there may be an adverse impact on our earnings 

    

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting 

 

effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct our business and operating results could be harmed our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and could subject us to stockholder litigation in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

 

our products must meet specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

 

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet ics as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is generally one to two years which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

 

 

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims

    

the price and availability of commodities eg gold copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

our products incorporate commodities such as gold copper and silicon an increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations

    

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the renminbi may adversely affect results of operations 

 

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future if the value of the renminbi rises against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition our sales are primarily denominated in the us dollar if the value of the us dollar rises against other currencies it may adversely affect the demand for our products in international markets which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

 

we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the timing of payments for transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries which are reported in interest and other income in the statements of operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the amount of foreign currency exchange losses we record which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations

    

our business is subject to various governmental laws and regulations and compliance with these regulations may impact our revenue and cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

 

our business is subject to various significant laws and other legal requirements imposed by the us and other countries we conduct business with including export control laws such as the us export administration regulations these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend sales to these customers which could negatively impact our results of operations we must conform the manufacture and distribution of our products to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in many countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products we could be required to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products are brought into compliance 

 

environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations 

  

we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of certain products such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate including various european union member countries and countries in asia there can be no assurance that similar laws and regulations will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs possible delays in delivering products and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future product replacements if the cost were to become prohibitive

 

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

 

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china and most of our manufacturing partners are located in china the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china additionally china ’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies 

 

 

personal privacy cyber security and data protection are becoming increasingly significant issues in china to address these issues the standing committee of the national people ’s congress promulgated the cyber security law of the people’s republic of china the “cyber security law” which took effect on june 1 2017 the cyber security law sets forth various requirements relating to the collection use storage disclosure and security of data among other things various chinese agencies are expected to issue additional regulations in the future to define these requirements more precisely these requirements may increase our costs of compliance we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of these regulatory requirements   any failure to comply with the cyber security law and the relevant regulations and policies could result in further cost and liability to us and could adversely affect our business and results of operations additionally increased costs to comply with and other burdens imposed by the cyber security law and relevant regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our suppliers vendors and other service providers as well as our customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

any additional new regulations or the amendment or modification of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results

    

the chinese government and provincial and local governments also have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facilities in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results   

 

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing and testing facilities in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

 

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china that began operations in 2006 we face the following risks among others with respect to our operations in china

 

  

  

     

if we are unable to maintain our facilities in china at fully operational status with qualified workers appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected

  

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and could do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profits 

 

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own wafer manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our profit margins

 

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

 

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures may be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it generally takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons including

 

  

 

  

  

  

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses   

 

our success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

 

our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development we expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and introduce new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability if we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results also if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources we could see material adverse effects on our business financial condition and operating results

    

in addition if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development

 

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could affect our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands of our business including design cycles our business could be harmed furthermore if we lose key personnel the search for a qualified replacement and the transition could interrupt our operations as the search could take us longer than expected and divert management resources and the newly hired employee could take longer than expected to integrate into the team 

 

if we fail to retain key employees in our sales applications finance and legal staff or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

 

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal staff maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal control that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

 

 

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

 

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships andor acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed

    

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire in addition acquisitions could result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders reduce our cash balances and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities which could adversely affect our business we may also be the target of strategic transactions which could divert our management’s attention and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business 

 

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities as a result of completing acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders ’ percentage ownership incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities or incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangibles such actions could impact our operating results and the price of our common stock 

 

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings 

    

we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with

 

  

     

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

in addition third parties may be interested in acquiring us we will consider and discuss such transactions as we deem appropriate such potential transactions may diver the attention of management and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in investigating and evaluating such transactions whether or not they are consummated

  

if we issue additional shares of stock in the future it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 

  

we may issue additional shares of common stock in the future in order to raise additional capital to fund our global operations or in connection with an acquisition we also issue restricted stock units to employees which convert into shares of common stock upon vesting any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate dilution of our stockholders in addition the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may result in additional regulatory requirements such as stockholder approval

    

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with many manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate   

 

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition

 

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline

 

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

 

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer suppliers our ic testing and manufacturing facilities a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia particularly in china such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

holders of our common stock 

 

as of february 21 2018 there were nine registered holders of record of our common stock a substantially greater number of holders of our common stock are “street name” or beneficial holders whose shares are held by banks brokers and other financial institutions 

 

dividend policy 

 

in june 2014 our board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock based on our historical practice stockholders of record as of the last business day of the quarter are entitled to receive the quarterly cash dividends when and if declared by our board of directors which are payable to the stockholders in the following month our board of directors declared the following cash dividends 

 

  

in february 2018 our board of direct ors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividends from 020 per share to 030 per share effective for the first quarter of 2018 

 

the declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions statutory requirements of delaware law compliance with the terms of future indebtedness and credit facilities and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of the stockholders

 

 

we anticipate that cash used for future dividend payments will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing us operations in addition we currently plan to repatriate cash from our bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund future dividends and continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from other foreign subsidiaries see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8 for further discussion

for the three months and year ended december 31 2017 we did not repurchase any shares under the program the program expired on december 31 2017 with a remaining unused balance of 50 million

 

 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k 

 

overview 

 

we are a leading semiconductor company that designs develops and markets highperformance power solutions founded in 1997 mps’s core strengths include deep systemlevel and applications knowledge strong analog design expertise and an innovative proprietary process technology these combined strengths enable mps to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energy efficient costeffective easytouse solutions for systems found in consumer computing and storage industrial automotive and communications applications our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers systems with green practical and compact solutions we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families as well as in new innovative product categories 

 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products we are not immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term

 

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits “ics” this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths

 

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult

    

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia where our products are incorporated into enduser products for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 our revenue from sales to customers in asia was 89 91 and 91 respectively we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter products which serve the consumer computing and storage industrial automotive and communications markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation inventories income taxes valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates 

 

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

 

revenue recognition   

 

our revenue consists primarily of product sales of assembled and tested integrated circuits and dies in wafer form to the consumer computing and storage industrial automotive and communications markets the remaining revenue has not been significant historically and primarily includes royalties from licensing arrangements and revenue from wafer testing services for third parties 

 

 

w e recognize revenue based on the following four criteria 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 is based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fees charged for products delivered and the collectability of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in us generally recognizing revenue upon shipment or delivery when title and risk of loss have transferred to customers including to most of the distributors original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers 

 

for each of the years ended december 31 201 7 2016 and 2015 88 of our sales respectively were made through distribution arrangements with third parties we generally recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery of products to the distributors based on the following considerations 

 

  

certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a perdistributor basis and information related to products in the distribution channel this reserve is recorded at the time of sale as of december 31 2017 and 2016 our reserve for stock rotation rights was 26 million and 19 million respectively 

 

if we enter into arrangements with distributors that have price adjustment or other rights that are not fixed or determinable we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributors have sold the products to end customers at which time the price is no longer subject to adjustment and is fixed three of our usbased distributors have such price adjustment rights and accordingly we defer revenue recognition on these shipments until the products are sold to the end customers by the distributors as of december 31 2017 and 2016 our deferred revenue balance before the price adjustments from these distributors was 19 million and 37 million and the deferred costs were 02 million and 03 million respectively 

 

on january 1  2018 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606   the primary effects of the new standard for us related to the timing of revenue recognition with the three usbased distributors with price adjustment rights see “recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of december 31 2017” in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

inventory valuation 

 

we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or it s current estimated net realizable value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required conversely if market conditions are more favorable inventory may be sold that was previously reserved 

    

valuation of goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

we evaluate intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist we perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist impairment of intangible assets is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the assets and their carrying value impairment for goodwill occurs if the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill is less than its carrying value and is recognized based on the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit ’s goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill the assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and revenue forecasts if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future including macroeconomic and market conditions we may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

 

accounting for income taxes   

  

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized

 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure

 

on december 22 2017 the tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” was enacted which significantly changed us corporate income tax law the 2017 tax act made the following material changes  1 reduction of the corporate income tax rate effective january 1 2018 2 replacement of the worldwide tax system with a territorial tax regime with a onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings 3 amendment on the deductibility of executive performancebased compensation and 4 creation of new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings 

 

as of december 31 2017 and 2016  we had a valuation allowance of 126 million and 274 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the fourth quarter of 2017 management assessed the realizability of the deferred tax assets and concluded that a full valuation allowance would no longer be needed on the federal deferred tax assets due principally to the enactment of the 2017 tax act as a result we released 216 million of valuation allowance which was recorded as a benefit in the income tax provision in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize other deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made 

 

income tax effects resulting from changes in tax laws are accounted for in the period in which the law is enacted as of december 31 2017 we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 tax act including the calculation of the deemed repatriation transition tax and the remeasurement of the deferred taxes as permitted by staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” issued by the securities and exchange commission on december 22 2017 we recorded provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates for the year ended december 31 2017 these provisional amounts are subject to revisions possibly materially as we perform further analysis of the 2017 tax act collect and prepare necessary financial data continue to assess our tax positions and interpret any additional guidance issued by the us treasury department internal revenue service “irs” financial accounting standards board “fasb” and other standardsetting and regulatory bodies any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to the income tax provision in the period when the analysis is complete we expect to complete the analysis within the oneyear measurement period ending december 21 2018 pursuant to sab 118

we are a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business including potential litigation regarding our shareholders and our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and employment matters the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations 

  

 

stockbased compensation 

  

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award   the fair value of restricted stock units “rsus” with service conditions or performance conditions is based on the grant date share price the fair value of rsus with only market conditions as well as rsus containing both market and performance conditions is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model the fair value of stock options shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan and rsus with a purchase price feature is estimated using the blackscholes model 

 

compensation expense related to awards with service conditions is recorded on a straightline basis over the requisite service period compensation expense related to awards subject to market or performance conditions is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche for awards with only market conditions compensation expense is not reversed if the market conditions are not satisfied for awards with only performance conditions as well as awards containing both market and performance conditions we recognize compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance criteria will be achieved management performs the probability assessment on a quarterly basis by reviewing external factors such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry forecasts and internal factors such as our business and operational objectives and revenue forecasts changes in the probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catchup adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date if the projected achievement was revised upward or if the actual results were higher than the projected achievement additional compensation expense would be recorded for the awards due to the cumulative catchup adjustment which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations conversely if the projected achievement was revised downward or if the actual results were lower than the projected achievement previously accrued compensation expense would be reversed for the awards which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations as a result our stockbased compensation expense is subject to volatility and may fluctuate significantly each quarter due to changes in our probability assessment or actual results being different from projections made by management

litigation expense was 12 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared with a litigation benefit net of 02 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase in litigation expense was primarily due to an ongoing litigation in addition we recognized 07 million of benefit in connection with two litigation settlements for the year ended december 31 2016

int erest and other income  net 

 

interest and other income net was 55 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared with 28 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to an increase of 29 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and higher yields and an increase of 13 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments partially offset by an increase of 10 million in amortization of premium on availableforsale investments and an increase of 06 million in foreign currency exchange loss

income tax provision 

 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2017 was 177 million or 214 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in bermuda and china was taxed at lower rates and because of the stockbased compensation deductions in addition the effective tax rate was impacted by the effects of the 2017 tax act and the release of the us valuation allowance as discussed in details below 

 

 

2017 us tax reform  

 

under accounting standards codification “asc” 740 income taxes  the effects of a new legislation are recognized upon enactment accordingly we were required to recognize the tax effects of the 2017 tax act beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 

 

on december 22 2017 the securities and exchange commission issued sab 118 which addresses the application of asc 740 in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 tax act in accordance with sab 118 for matters that have not been completed we would recognize provisional amounts to the extent that they are reasonably estimable if a reasonable estimate cannot be determined we would not be required to report provisional amounts and would continue to apply asc 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the 2017 tax act 

 

as o f december 31 2017 we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 tax act and recorded certain provisional amounts as discussed below based on reasonable estimates for the year ended december 31 2017 the provisional amounts are subject to revisions possibly materially as we perform further analysis of the 2017 tax act collect and prepare necessary financial data continue to assess our tax positions and interpret any additional guidance issued by the us treasury department irs fasb and other standardsetting and regulatory bodies any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to the income tax provision in the period when the analysis is complete we expect to complete the analysis within the oneyear measurement period ending december 21 2018 pursuant to sab 118 

 

corporate tax rate and re me asurement of deferred taxes 

 

the 2017 tax act reduces the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 because asc 740 requires the effect o f a change in tax laws to be recognized as of the date of enactment we remeasured our deferred tax balance as of december 22 2017 and recorded a provisional amount of 98 million to the income tax provision as a result of the remeasurement for the year ended december 31 2017 

 

deemed repatriation transition tax 

 

t he 2017 tax act mandates a onetime deemed repatriation transition tax of post1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits “ep” on which us income taxes were previously deferred the rate applied varies depending on whether the ep is held in liquid or nonliquid assets a proportional deduction on the deemed repatriation results in a transition tax of 155 for cash and liquid assets and 8 for nonliquid assets the transition tax is assessed regardless of whether we repatriate the earnings the transition tax is determined on the greater of ep as of two measurement dates november 2 2017 or december 31 2017 the amount of cash and liquid assets is determined based on the greater of the amounts calculated using two alternative measurement periods 

 

for the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded a provisional amount of 419 million related to the transition tax expense after the utilization of rd tax credits of 180 million the transition tax payable is 239 million as permitted by the 2017 tax act we have elected to pay the transition tax in installments over eight years as a result 19 million was recorded in current accrued liabilities and 220 million was recorded in longterm income tax liabilities as of december 31 2017 

  

undistributed earnings of subsidiaries 

 

we previously considered the earnings in our nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly recorded no deferred income ta xes prior to the transition tax we had an excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries including undistributed foreign earnings of 3902 million while the transition tax resulted in the reduction of the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries and subjected a provisional amount of 1197 million of undistributed foreign earnings to tax an actual repatriation from our nonus subsidiaries could be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and us state taxes 

 

we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and have determined that we plan to repatriate cash from our bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund our future us based expenditures and dividends for the other foreign subsidiaries we expect to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings to fund foreign operations and their research and development for those undistributed foreign earnings from which we were not able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation we have not recorded any deferred taxes or accrued for any withholding taxes or state taxes as of december 31 2017 we will record the tax effects of any change in our prior assertion with respect to those undistributed foreign earnings in the period that we are first able to make a reasonable estimate no later than the end of the measurement period under sab 118  

 

global in tangible lowtaxed income 

  

the 2017 tax act subjects a us parent shareholder to taxation of its global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” effective january 1 2018 the gilti inclusions will impact companies that have foreign earnings generated without a large aggregate foreign fixed asset base and whose earnings are being taxed at a low tax rate gilti is calculated based on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations the income inclusion under gilti is eligible for a deduction that is intended to lower the effective tax rate to 105 for taxable years 2018 to 2025 and rise to 13125 for taxable years after 2025 the enactment of the gilti tax will result in additional subpart f income recognition for us in 2018 and onwards 

 

 

executive compensation deductions 

 

the 2017 tax act retains the 1 million limitation on deductible compensation to covered employees which include the chief executive officer and four other highest paid officers under irc section 162m however it eliminates the exception for performancebased cash or stock compensation and expands the definition of covered employees to include the chief financial officer accordi ngly beginning january 1 2018 the deductible compensation to covered employees will generally be subject to the 1 million limitation 

  

release of valuation allowance  

  

management periodically evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence the realizability of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax attributes to fully utilize these assets we maintained a full valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets as of the third quarter of 2017   in the fourth quarter of 2017 we assessed the realizability of the deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets would be realizable  due principally to the enactment of the 2017 tax act in accordance with asc 740 management considered all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of that evidence a valuation allowance for deferred tax asset was needed our conclusion was primarily driven by the following positive evidence 

 

    

as a result w e released 216 million of valuation allowance on federal deferred tax assets which was recorded as a benefit in the income tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2017 we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in california primarily due to a low apportionment factor and the amount of rd tax credits generated is greater than the amount utilized 

 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2016 was 45 million or 79 of pretax income the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in bermuda and china was taxed at lower rates in addition the effective tax rate was impacted by changes in valuation allowance and the stockbased compensation deductions 

 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2015 was 73 million or 172 of pretax income we recorded a onetime net charge of 27 million to the income tax provision related to the resolution of the income tax audits in the second quarter of 2015 in addition to the impact of this charge the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in bermuda and china was taxed at lower rates and from the release of an income tax reserve where the statute of limitations expired in addition the effective tax rate was impacted by changes in valuation allowance 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  

 

as of december 31 2017 we had cas h and cash equivalents of 828 million and shortterm investments of 2163 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of 1127 million and shortterm investments of 1555 million as of december 31 2016 as of december 31 2017 664 million of cash and cash equivalents and 1131 million of shortterm investments were held by our international subsidiaries after the enactment of the 2017 tax act we currently plan to repatriate cash from our bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund our future expenditures in the us and continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from other foreign subsidiaries see the income tax provision section for further discussion 

    

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable inventories and other current assets reduced by accounts payable accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities as of december 31 2017 we had working capital of 3833 million compared with working capital of 3301 million as of december 31 2016 the 532 million increase in working capital was due to a 662 million increase in current assets partially offset by a 130 million increase in current liabilities the increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in shortterm investments accounts receivable inventories and prepaid expenses partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities 

 

summary of cash flows   

 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash provided by operating activities was 1338 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization  stockbased compensation and deferred taxes and a net increase of 157 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in deferred taxes was primarily due to the release of the us valuation allowance partially offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax balance as a result of the 2017 tax act in the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by higher sales the increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan and warranty expenses the increase in income tax liabilities was primarily driven by the onetime deemed repatriation transition tax liability recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 

 

for the year ended december 31 2016 net cash provided b y operating activities was 1078 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation and a net decrease of 29 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in other assets was primarily due to a prepaid wafer purchase agreement we funded during the year the increase in inventories was primarily driven by increased purchases to meet current demand and future growth the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan 

    

for the year ended december 31 2015 net cash provided by operating activities was 697 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation a change in fair value of contingent consideration and a net decrease of 126 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by increased sales the increase in inventori es was primarily driven by increased purchases to meet current demand and future growth the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan

for the year ended december 31 2017 we funded the purchases of land in kirkland washington office space in shanghai and hangzhou china and land and office space in taipei taiwan for 538 million for the year ended december 31 2016 we funded the purchases of a previously leased manufacturing facility in chengdu china office space in shenzhen china and land and office space in taipei taiwan for 175 million for the year ended december 31 2015 we spent 54 million to purchase office space in shanghai china 

 

for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash used in financing activities was 313 million primarily reflecting 339 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus partially offset by 29 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december 31 2016 net cash used in financing activities was 281 million primarily reflecting 331 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus partially offset by 38 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december 31 2015 net cash used in financing activities was 467 million primarily reflecting 323 million used in repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and 300 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus partially offset by 100 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan 

 

in july 2013 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million in the aggregate of our common stock the program expired on december 31 2015 in february 2016 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to 50 million in the aggregate of our common stock the program expired on december 31 2017 for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we did not repurchase any shares for the year ended december 31 2015 we repurchased a total of 06 million shares for 323 million at an average price of 5005 per share 

 

in june 2014 our board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock in addition outstanding rsu awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents which entitle employees who hold rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock the dividend equival ents are accumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying rsus vest dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying rsus are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement and the awards do not vest for the year ended december 31 2017 we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling 339 million for the year ended december 31 2016 we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling 331 million for the year ended december 31 2015 we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling 300 million 

 

in february 2018 our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividends from 020 per share to 030 per share effective for the first quarter of 2018 

    

we anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments as well as payments for the onetime deemed repatriation transition tax will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing us operations as a result of the 2017 tax act we also plan to repatriate cash from our bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund these and other future expenditures in the us and continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from other foreign subsidiaries see the income tax provision section for further discussion 

 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and shortterm investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months 

 

in the future in order to strengthen our financial position respond to changes in our circumstance or unforeseen events or conditions or fund our growth we may need to discontinue paying dividends and dividend equivalents and may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities issuing debt or convertible debt securities incurring indebtedness secured by our assets or selling certain product lines andor portions of our business accordingly we cannot ensure that we will continue to pay dividends and dividend equivalents in the future and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines technologies businesses and companies and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities assumptions of debt andor payment of cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisitions through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 

 

 

contractual obligations   

 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2017

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by management and approved by our board of directors such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities a 10 decline in interest rates would impact our results of operations by approximately 05 million in interest income

    

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale for availableforsale investments no gains or losses are recognized in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired availableforsale investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders ’ equity 

 

longterm investments 

 

as of december 31 2017  our holdings in auctionrate securities which have a fair value of 53 million have failed to reset as a result of current market conditions a 10 decline in the fair value could impact our results of operations by approximately 05 million if we determined the decline in value to be otherthantemporary 

 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

our sales outside the united states are primarily transacted in us dollars through our subsidiary in bermuda accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes the functional currency of the company ’s offshore operations is generally the local currency primarily including the renminbi the new taiwan dollar and the euro in addition we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain intercompany transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency gains or losses from the settlement and remeasurement of the balances are reported in interest and other income fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations in any of the periods presented

industry overview 

  

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or integrated circuits “ics” in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for high performance analog and mixedsignal ics high performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish analog and mixedsignal ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market from digital ic markets these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have however targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer aboveaverage growth over the long term compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole 

  

market segments and applications 

  

we currently target our products at the communications computing and storage consumer and industrial markets with the consumer market representing the largest portion of our revenue the following is a brief summary of the various applications in each market segment and each market segment’s contribution as a percentage of our total revenue 

  

   

 

 

  

product families 

  

our proprietary process technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller singlechip power management ics these technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of analog applications within the consumer industrial computing and storage and communications markets o ur product families are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions our key product families include the following 

  

direct current dc to dc products   dc to dc ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers and monitors automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc products are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current high switching speed and small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices the dc to dc product family accounted for approximately 90 of our total revenue in 2016 2015 and 2014   

  

lighting control products lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers monitors car navigation systems and televisions backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps in addition to acdc offline solutions for lighting illumination applications we also offer acdc power conversion solutions for a diverse number of end products that plug into a wall outlet the lighting control product family accounted for approximately 10 of our total revenue in 2016 2015 and 2014 

  

in the future we will continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as expand our newer product families our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of china taiwan and other asian markets expand our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

customers sales and marketing 

  

we sell our products through third party distributors valueadded resellers and directly to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms and electronic manufacturing service ems providers our third party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors distribute our products to end customers which include oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers 

  

sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 22 of revenue in 2016 24 of revenue in 2015 and 26 of revenue in 2014 no other distributors or end customers accounted for more than 10 of revenue in any of the periods presented 

  

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor has the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

  

 

 

  

we have sales offices located in china japan korea taiwan and the united states and have marketing representatives in india singapore and europe our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems’ electronics containing our products 

  

because our sales are primarily billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because a majority of our revenue is attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 91 of our revenue was from customers in asia 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped our manufacturing lead times are generally 8 to 16 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount take a significant writedown or dispose of it altogether all of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in the united states and china with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products in the area of process technology we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technology is a key strategic component to our future growth 

  

our research and development expenses totaled 736 million 658 million and 586 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of december 31 2016 we had 1123 patentsapplications issued or pending of which 319 patents have been issued in the united states our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2036 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business 

  

 

 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights for a more complete description of our legal matters please read note 14 to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ics this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies who utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technologies and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our ics 

  

we currently contract with four suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china and korea once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in china and malaysia the assembled ics are then sent either for final testing at our chengdu facility or to other turnkey providers who perform final testing based on our standards prior to shipping to our customers 

  

in september 2004 we entered into a lease arrangement for a 60000 squarefoot manufacturing facility located in chengdu china in september 2015 we exercised our option to purchase the facility and the transaction was completed in january 2016 the facility has been fully operational since 2006 and we have benefitted from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs compared to our operations prior to the use of the facility we have expanded our product testing capabilities in this facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations in addition we constructed a 150000 squarefoot research and development facility in chengdu china which was put into operation in october 2010 

  

key personnel and employees 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2016 we employed 1417 employees primarily located in china india japan korea singapore taiwan the united states and europe compared with 1260 employees as of december 31 2015 

  

 

 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices infineon technologies intersil recently acquired by renesas electronics linear technology pending acquisition by analog devices maxim integrated products nxp semiconductors pending acquisition by qualcomm on semiconductor power integrations rohm semiconductor semtech and texas instruments 

  

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however there is no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market in addition there has recently been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry if these or future acquisitions are successful competition may intensify and our competitors may have additional resources to compete against us

our business has been and may continue to be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions and uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy makes it more likely that our actual results will differ materially from expectations 

  

in recent years global credit and financial markets have experienced disruptions and may continue to experience disruptions in the future including diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and continued uncertainty about economic stability these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the continued or further tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish liquidity and capital availability demand for our products is a function of the health of the economies in the united states europe china and the rest of the world we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic disruption or subsequent economic recovery worldwide in the united states in our industry or in the different markets that we serve these and other economic factors have had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

  

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

  

our profitability is dependent on many factors including 

  

   

  

 

 

  

   

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in our operations including any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability 

  

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

  

in the past our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products due to various factors including increased competition loss of certain of our customers unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and ongoing litigation we may not experience growth rates comparable to past periods which could materially and adversely affect our stock price and results of operations 

  

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

  

in june 2014 the board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock we anticipate the cash used for future dividends will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing us operations if cash held by our international subsidiaries is needed for the payment of dividends we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions statutory requirements of delaware law compliance with the terms of future indebtedness and credit facilities and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

  

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above industry averages should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

 

 

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

  

in recent years there has been a trend toward semiconductor industry consolidation we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to improve the leverage of growing research and development costs strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry or become unable to continue operations unless they find an acquirer or consolidate with another company in addition companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that semiconductor industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

  

we believe that the application of our products in the communications computing and storage consumer and industrial markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

  

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors 

  

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets 

  

 

 

  

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

  

   

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we may face competition from customers developing products internally 

  

our customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources some customers have traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of thirdparty sourcing for products as an alternative to inhouse development customers may in the future continue to use internally developed components they also may decide to develop or acquire components technologies or products that are similar to or that may be substituted for our products if our customers fail to accept our products as an alternative if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

  

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct sales or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and valueadded reseller agreements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2016 91 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including 

  

   

 

 

  

   

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and financial condition 

  

we depend on a limited number of customers including distributors for a significant percentage of our revenue 

  

historically we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers including distributors for example sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 22 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2016 we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenue a decrease in demand or significant pricing pressure for our products from any of our major customers for any reason including due to competitions market conditions catastrophic events or otherwise could have a materially adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 

  

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which places us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by the us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 

 

  

new regulations related to “conflict minerals” may force us to incur additional expenses may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers 

  

in august 2012 under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act the sec adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals known as conflict minerals in their products whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties these requirements require companies to conduct diligence disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries we have undertaken the necessary diligence to determine whether such minerals are used in the manufacture of our products however the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be used in the manufacture of our products in addition regardless of our findings we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products since our supply chain is complex we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation in such event we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free 

  

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements valueadded resellers and direct customers and the loss of any one of these distributors valueadded resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

  

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers “emss” receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 22 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2016 significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply commitments 

  

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or an oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

  

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

  

 

 

  

our ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

  

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  as a result this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations delays in increasing thirdparty manufacturing capacity may also limit our ability to meet customer demand 

  

we currently depend on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable andor fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

  

we have a supply arrangement with certain suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management of the supplier relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

  

we do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as global economic crises may materially impact our assembly suppliers’ ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our thirdparty suppliers’ manufacturing capacity 

  

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops and testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities such activities are subject to a number of risks including 

  

   

   

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty suppliers’ capacity 

  

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

  

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from thirdparty manufacturers in advance of selling our products we place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the timeframe that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigation or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be disposed of or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items such as future exercises or dispositions of stock options and restricted stock releases in addition we are subject to potential future examinations of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities for example our us federal income tax returns for the years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2007 were examined by the irs we reached a resolution on the audits in april 2015 and recorded a onetime net charge of 27 million to our income tax provision in the second quarter of 2015 in addition our us federal income tax return for the year ended december 31 2014 was under examination by the irs no adjustments were made by the irs upon conclusion of the examination we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

  

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision we have hired thirdparty tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our independent tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which if material would result in us having to restate our financial statements restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

  

 

 

  

system security risks data protection or privacy breaches cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations andor harm our reputation and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue increase our expenses negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price 

  

experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions 

  

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data on our internal systems network and servers such as proprietary business and financial information and confidential data pertaining to our customers suppliers and business partners the secure maintenance of sensitive information on our networks and the protection features of our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy we devote significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data however these security measures cannot provide absolute security although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and solutions any destructive or intrusive breach could compromise our networks creating system disruptions or slowdowns and the information stored on our networks could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen if any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data our relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially damaged our reputation could be materially harmed and we could be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible significant liability 

  

portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 

  

if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

  

from time to time we are a party to various legal proceedings if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be significant we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products and our products and our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

  

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publicly disclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

  

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in us incurring unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be materially impacted 

  

 

 

  

future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses our financial condition could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could divert management’s attention from focusing on our operations and adversely affect our business 

  

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities has suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days became illiquid in 2008 we experienced our first failed auction in midfebruary 2008 since 2008 we have redeemed 87 of the original portfolio at par at december 31 2016 56 million of our auctionrate securities have failed to reset through successful auctions and it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 31 years 

  

we have historically recorded temporary and otherthantemporary impairment charges on these investments the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the quality of underlying collateral estimated time for liquidity including potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty and market conditions among others 

  

should there be further deterioration in the market for auctionrate securities the value of our portfolio may decline which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our earnings if the accounting rules for these securities change there may be an adverse impact on our earnings 

  

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting 

  

effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct our business and operating results could be harmed our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and could subject us to stockholder litigation in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

  

 

 

  

our products must meet specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

  

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is generally one to two years which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

  

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

  

the price and availability of commodities eg gold copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our products incorporate commodities such as gold copper and silicon an increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the renminbi may adversely affect results of operations 

  

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future if the value of the renminbi rises against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition our sales are primarily denominated in the us dollar if the value of the us dollar rises against other currencies it may adversely affect the demand for our products in international markets which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the timing of payments for transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries which are reported in interest and other income in the statements of operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the amount of foreign currency exchange losses we record which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

  

 

 

  

our business is subject to various governmental laws and regulations and compliance with these regulations may impact our revenue and cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations we may be forced to recall products and cease their distribution and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

our business is subject to various significant laws and other legal requirements imposed by the us and other countries we conduct business with including export control laws such as the us export administration regulations these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend sales to these customers which could negatively impact our results of operations for example on march 8 2016 the us department of commerce added zte corporation one of our customers to its entity list and placed certain export restrictions on zte and its suppliers these restrictions are temporarily lifted until march 29 2017 we must conform the manufacture and distribution of our products to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in many countries as these requirements change if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products we could be required to pay civil penalties face criminal prosecution and in some cases be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products are brought into compliance 

  

environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations 

  

we are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of certain products such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate including various european union member countries and countries in asia there can be no assurance that similar laws and regulations will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs possible delays in delivering products and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future product replacements if the cost were to become prohibitive 

  

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

  

most of our manufacturing partners are located in china in addition we have established manufacturing and testing facilities in china the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facilities in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing and testing facilities in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

  

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china that began operations in 2006 we face the following risks among others with respect to our operations in china 

  

   

 

 

  

if we are unable to maintain our facilities in china at fully operational status with qualified workers appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profits 

  

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own wafer manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our profit margins 

  

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

  

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures may be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it generally takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons including 

  

   

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

  

our success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

  

our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development we expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and introduce new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability if we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results also if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources we could see material adverse effects on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

 

 

  

in addition if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 

  

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could affect our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands of our business including design cycles our business could be harmed furthermore if we lose key personnel the search for a qualified replacement and the transition could interrupt our operations as the search could take us longer than expected and divert management resources and the newly hired employee could take longer than expected to integrate into the team 

  

if we fail to retain key employees in our sales applications finance and legal staff or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

  

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal staff maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal control that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

  

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

  

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships andor acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

 

 

  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire in addition acquisitions could result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders reduce our cash balances and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities which could adversely affect our business 

  

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities for example we completed our acquisition of sensima technology sa “sensima” in july 2014 to further our diversification strategy and create new opportunities with key customers as a result of completing acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities or incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangibles such actions could impact our operating results and the price of our common stock 

  

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings 

  

we cannot guarantee that the sensima acquisition or any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with 

  

   

   

if we issue additional shares of stock in the future it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 

  

we may issue additional shares of common stock in the future in order to raise additional capital to fund our global operations or in connection with an acquisition we also issue restricted stock units to employees which convert into shares of common stock upon vesting any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate dilution of our stockholders in addition the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may result in additional regulatory requirements such as stockholder approval 

  

 

 

  

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with many manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate 

  

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

  

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

  

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer suppliers our ic testing and manufacturing facilities a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia particularly in china such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k 

  

overview 

  

we are a leading company that designs develops and markets highperformance power solutions founded in 1997 mps’s core strengths include deep systemlevel and applications knowledge strong analog design expertise and an innovative proprietary process technology these combined strengths enable mps to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energy efficient costeffective easytouse solutions for systems found in industrial applications telecommunication infrastructures cloud computing automotive and consumer applications our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers systems with green practical and compact solutions we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families as well as in new innovative product categories 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products we are not immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits “ics” this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths 

  

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult 

  

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia where the products we produce are incorporated into enduser products for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 91 of our revenue was from customers in asia we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter products which serves the consumer industrial computing and storage and communications markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

in july 2014 we completed the acquisition of sensima technology sa “sensima” a company located in switzerland that develops magnetic sensors for angle measurements as well as threedimensional magnetic field sensing sensima became a subsidiary of mps and changed its name to mps tech switzerland sarl the acquisition creates new opportunities with customers by offering enhanced solutions in power management for key industries such as automotive industrial and cloud computing the purchase consideration consisted of an upfront cash payment of 117 million and additional consideration that was contingent upon sensima achieving a new product introduction and certain revenue and direct margin goals in 2016 with a fair value of 25 million at the date of acquisition in addition key employees received 17 million of timebased restricted stock units and up to 80 million of performancebased restricted stock units in connection with the transaction these equity awards are considered arrangements for postacquisition services and the related compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance goals will be met the results of operations of sensima have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date on december 31 2016 management concluded that no contingent consideration was earned as the actual product revenue in 2016 did not meet the minimum target 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation inventories income taxes valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates 

  

 

 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fees charged for products delivered and the collectability of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in us generally recognizing revenue upon shipment when title and risk of loss have transferred to customers including to most of the distributors original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers 

  

for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 approximately 88 88 and 89 of our sales respectively were made through distribution arrangements with third parties we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the distributors based on the following considerations 

  

   

certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per distributor basis and information related to products in the distribution channel this reserve is recorded at the time of sale as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the reserve for stock rotation rights was 19 million and 24 million respectively 

  

if we enter into arrangements with distributors that have price adjustment or other rights that are not fixed or determinable we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributors have sold the products to end customers at which time the price is no longer subject to adjustment and is fixed and the products are no longer subject to return except pursuant to warranty terms a small number of our us distributors has such rights and accordingly we defer revenue recognition on these shipments until the products are sold to the end customers by the distributors the deferred revenue balance before the final price and other adjustments from these distributors as of december 31 2016 and 2015 was 37 million and 28 million respectively the deferred costs as of december 31 2016 and 2015 were 03 million and 02 million respectively 

  

inventory valuation 

  

we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required conversely if market conditions are more favorable inventory may be sold that was previously reserved 

    

valuation of goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

we evaluate intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist we perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist impairment of intangible assets is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the assets and their carrying value impairment for goodwill occurs if the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill is less than its carrying value and is recognized based on the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill the assumptions and estimates used to determine future value of goodwill and intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and revenue forecasts if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future including macroeconomic and market conditions we may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

 

 

  

accounting for income taxes   

  

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure 

  

as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we had a valuation allowance of 274 million and 186 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets in the us will not be realized should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

  

as a result of the cost sharing arrangements with our international subsidiaries cost share arrangements relatively small changes in costs that are not subject to sharing under the cost share arrangements can significantly impact the overall profitability of the us entity because of the us entity’s inconsistent earnings history and uncertainty of future earnings we have determined that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax benefits will not be realized 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business including potential litigation regarding our shareholders and our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and employment matters the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award   the fair value of restricted stock units with service conditions or performance conditions is based on the grant date share price the fair value of restricted stock units with market conditions as well as restricted stock units with both market conditions and performance conditions is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model the fair value of options shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock units with a purchase price feature is estimated using the blackscholes model 

  

 

 

  

we recognize compensation expense equal to the grantdate fair value for all sharebased payment awards that are expected to vest this expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the entire awards unless the awards are subject to market conditions or performance conditions in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche for awards with only market conditions compensation expense is not reversed if the market conditions are not satisfied for awards with performance conditions as well as awards with both market conditions and performance conditions we recognize compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance criteria set by the board of directors will be achieved this assessment is performed on a quarterly basis and requires significant assumptions and estimates made by management related to the projected achievement of the performance goals which can be affected by external factors such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry forecasts and internal factors such as our business and operations strategy product roadmaps and revenue forecasts changes in the probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catchup adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date if the projected achievement was revised upward or if the actual achievement was higher than the projected achievement additional compensation expense may be recorded for the performancebased awards due to the cumulative catchup adjustment which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations conversely if the projected achievement was revised downward or if the actual achievement was lower than the projected achievement previously accrued compensation expense would be reversed for the performancebased awards which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations as a result our stockbased compensation expense is subject to volatility and may fluctuate significantly each quarter due to changes in our probability assessment or actual results being different from projections made by management

the following table summarizes our results of operations 

  

  

 

 

  

revenue 

  

the following table summarizes our revenue by market segments 

  

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2016 was 3887 million an increase of 556 million or 167 from 3331 million for the year ended december 31 2015 this increase was driven by higher sales in the computing and storage industrial and consumer segments as overall unit shipments increased 19 due to higher market demand with current customers and design wins with new customers partially offset by a 2 decrease in average sales prices 

  

revenue from the consumer segment for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 86 million or 60 from the same period in 2015 this increase was primarily driven by higher demand in battery management systems home appliances and other high value consumer products revenue from the industrial segment for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 233 million or 351 from the same period in 2015 this increase was primarily driven by higher sales in automotive applications security products smart meters and power sources revenue from the computing and storage segment for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 240 million or 424 from the same period in 2015 this increase was primarily driven by strength in the highperformance notebook server and solidstate drive storage markets revenue from the communications segment for the year ended december 31 2016 was essentially flat compared to the same period in 2015 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 was 3331 million an increase of 506 million or 179 from 2825 million for the year ended december 31 2014 this increase was driven by higher sales in all market segments as overall unit shipments increased 17 due to higher market demand with current customers and design wins with new customers coupled with an increase of 1 in average sales prices 

  

revenue from the consumer segment for the year ended december 31 2015 increased 224 million or 182 from the same period in 2014 this increase was primarily driven by higher demand in gaming battery management systems home appliances and other high value consumer products revenue from the industrial segment for the year ended december 31 2015 increased 173 million or 353 from the same period in 2014 this increase was primarily driven by higher sales in automotive applications and other industrial equipment revenue from the computing and storage segment for the year ended december 31 2015 increased 104 million or 226 from the same period in 2014 this increase was primarily driven by strength in the server and highperformance notebook markets revenue from the communications segment for the year ended december 31 2015 was essentially flat compared to the same period in 2014 

  

cost of revenue and gross margin   

  

cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred to manufacture assemble and test our products as well as warranty costs inventoryrelated and other overhead costs and stockbased compensation expenses in addition cost of revenue includes amortization for acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

 

 

 

cost of revenue was 1778 million or 457 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2016 and 1529 million or 459 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 the 249 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 19 increase in overall unit shipments which was partially offset by a 2 decrease in the average direct cost of units shipped the increase in cost of revenue was also driven by an increase of 10 million in warranty expenses and inventory writedowns gross margin was 543 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared with 541 for the year ended december 31 2015 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower direct and overhead costs as a percentage of revenue partially offset by the impact of certain manufacturing cost variances 

  

 

 

  

cost of revenue was 1529 million or 459 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 and 1299 million or 460 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 the 230 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 17 increase in overall unit shipments coupled with a 4 increase in the average direct cost of units shipped the increase in cost of revenue was also driven by an additional 11 million of amortization for intangible assets gross margin was 541 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared with 540 for the year ended december 31 2014 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower direct and overhead costs as a percentage of revenue partially offset by increased sales of lower margin products and higher amortization for intangible assets compared to the same period in 2014 

  

research and development

summary of cash flows 

  

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities 

  

   

 

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2016 net cash provided by operating activities was 1078 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation and a net decrease of 29 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in other assets was primarily due to a prepaid wafer purchase agreement we funded during the year the increase in inventories was primarily driven by increased purchases to meet current demand and future growth the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan

for the year ended december 31 2016 net cash used in financing activities was 281 million primarily reflecting 331 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus partially offset by 38 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december 31 2015 net cash used in financing activities was 467 million primarily reflecting 323 million used in repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and 300 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus partially offset by 100 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december 31 2014 net cash used in financing activities was 392 million primarily reflecting 412 million used in repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and 117 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus partially offset by 140 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan 

  

in july 2013 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to 100 million in the aggregate of our common stock the program expired on december 31 2015 in february 2016 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to 50 million in the aggregate of our common stock through december 31 2016 the program was extended by the board of directors to december 31 2017 for the year ended december 31 2016 we did not repurchase any shares for the year ended december 31 2015 we repurchased a total of 06 million shares for 323 million at an average price of 5005 per share for the year ended december 31 2014 we repurchased a total of 11 million shares for 412 million at an average price of 3919 per share 

  

in june 2014 our board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock in addition outstanding rsu awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents which entitle employees who hold rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock the dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying rsus vest dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying rsus are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement and the awards do not vest for the year ended december 31 2016 we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling 331 million for the year ended december 31 2015 we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling 300 million for the year ended december 31 2014 we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling 117 million 

  

 

 

  

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and shortterm investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months 

  

we anticipate the cash used for future dividends dividend equivalents and the stock repurchase program will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing us operations if cash held by our international subsidiaries is needed for these payments we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds in the future in order to strengthen our financial position respond to changes in our circumstance or unforeseen events or conditions or fund our growth we may need to discontinue paying dividends and dividend equivalents or repurchasing shares and may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities issuing debt or convertible debt securities incurring indebtedness secured by our assets or selling certain product lines andor portions of our business accordingly we cannot ensure that we will continue to pay dividends and dividend equivalents or repurchase shares in the future and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines technologies businesses and companies and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities assumptions of debt andor payment of cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisitions through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by management and approved by our board of directors such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities fluctuations in interest rates of 10 would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

    

 

 

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale for availableforsale investments no gains or losses are recognized in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired availableforsale investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

longterm investments 

  

as of december 31 2016 our holdings in auctionrate securities which have a fair value of 54 million have failed to reset as a result of current market conditions a 10 decline in the fair value could impact our results of operations by approximately 05 million if we determine the decline in value to be otherthantemporary 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our sales outside the united states are primarily transacted in us dollars through our subsidiary in bermuda accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes the functional currency of the company’s offshore operations is generally the local currency including the renminbi the new taiwan dollar and the euro in addition we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain intercompany transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency gains or losses from the settlement and remeasurement of the balances are reported in interest and other income to date fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations

industry overview 

  

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or as ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for ‘high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics ‘high performance’ products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish analog and mixedsignal ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market from digital ic markets these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have however targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

acquisition 

  

in july 2014 we completed the acquisition of sensima technology sa “sensima” a company based in switzerland that develops magnetic sensors for angle measurement as well as threedimensional magnetic field sensing sensima became a subsidiary of mps and changed its name to mps tech switzerland sarl sensima’s products are based on hall devices that are directly integrated with the signal treatment and instantaneously detect and deliver the angle value in digital format sensima’s angle sensors are used in rotary encoders electronically commutated motors and a broad range of products by combining sensima’s real time precision magnetic angle sensing with our motor control technologies we are creating new opportunities with customers by offering enhanced solutions such as our integrated emotion solutions in power management for a wide array of end products such as cars robots and security cameras in automotive industrial and cloud computing industries 

  

for a detailed discussion of the terms of the acquisition please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

  products and applications 

  

we currently have two primary product families that address multiple applications within the communications storage and computing consumer and industrial markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

 

direct current dc to dc products dc to dc ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers and monitors automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc products are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current high switching speed and small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices the dc to dc product family accounted for 90 90 and 89 of our total revenue in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively   

    

 

 

    

lighting control products and acdc offline solutions lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers lcd monitors car navigation systems and lcd televisions backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode wled lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfl in addition to acdc offline solutions for lighting illumination applications we also offer acdc power conversion solutions for a diverse number of end products that plug into a wall outlet the lighting control product family accounted for 10 10 and 11 of our total revenue in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

we currently target our products at the communications storage and computing consumer and industrial markets with the consumer market representing the largest portion of our revenue the following is a summary of our products for various applications 

  

  

we derive a majority of our revenue from our dc to dc ic product family sold to these market segments in the future we will continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families such as high current high voltage small form factor switching voltage regulators as well as expand our newer product families in battery chargers voltage references and low dropout regulators our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of china taiwan and other asian markets expand our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

for a detailed discussion of our revenue by product family please refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

customers sales and marketing 

  

we sell our products through third party distributors valueadded resellers and directly to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms and electronic manufacturing service ems providers our third party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors may distribute our products to end customers which include oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers 

  

sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 24 of revenue in 2015 26 of revenue in 2014 and 32 of revenue in 2013 in addition one other distributor accounted for 10 of revenue in 2013 no other customers accounted for more than 10 of revenue in any of the periods presented 

  

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor shall have the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

  

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china korea and japan and have marketing representatives in europe and singapore our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems’ electronics containing our products 

  

 

 

    

because our sales are primarily billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are generally not subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because a majority of our revenue is attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 approximately 91 91 and 90 of our revenue was from customers in asia respectively 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped our manufacturing lead times are generally 8 to 16 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount take a significant writedown or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in the united states and china with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products in the area of process technology we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technology is a key strategic component to our future growth 

  

our research and development expenses totaled 658 million 586 million and 497 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 1142 patentsapplications issued or pending of which 244 patents have been issued in the united states our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2035 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights for a more complete description of our legal matters please read note 13 to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

 

    

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies who utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our integrated circuits 

  

we currently contract with three suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in china and malaysia the assembled ics are then sent for final testing at our chengdu facility and other turnkey providers prior to shipping to our customers 

  

in september 2004 we entered into a lease arrangement for a 60000 squarefoot manufacturing facility located in chengdu china in september 2015 we exercised our option to acquire the facility and expect to close the transaction in the first half of 2016 the facility has been fully operational since 2006 and we have benefitted from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs we have expanded our product testing capabilities in our china facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations 

  

in addition we constructed a 150000 squarefoot research and development facility in chengdu china which was put into operation in october 2010 

  

key personnel and employees 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2015 we employed 1260 employees located in china europe japan korea singapore taiwan and the united states compared with 1178 employees as of december 31 2014 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices fairchild semiconductor intersil corporation linear technology maxim integrated products microchip technology microsemi corporation o2 micro international on semiconductor power integrations inc richtek technology corporation rohm co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments inc 

  

 

 

    

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business involves risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

     

 

 

    

   

in addition the stock market often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

  

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

  

   

 

 

  

   

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

  

our business has been and may continue to be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions and uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy makes it more likely that our actual results will differ materially from expectations 

  

in recent years global credit and financial markets experienced disruptions and may continue to experience disruptions in the future including diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and continued uncertainty about economic stability these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the continued or further tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish liquidity and capital availability demand for our products is a function of the health of the economies in the united states europe china and the rest of the world we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic disruption or subsequent economic recovery worldwide in the united states in our industry or in the different markets that we serve these and other economic factors have had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

  

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

  

our profitability is dependent on many factors including 

  

     

 

 

  

  

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in our operations including any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability 

  

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

  

in the past our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products due to various factors including increased competition loss of certain of our customers unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and ongoing litigation we may not experience growth rates comparable to past periods which could materially and adversely affect our stock price and results of operations 

  

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

  

in june 2014 the board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock we anticipate the cash used for future dividends will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing us operations if cash held by our international subsidiaries is needed for the payment of dividends we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions statutory requirements of delaware law compliance with the terms of future indebtedness and credit facilities and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

  

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above industry averages should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

 

    

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

  

we believe that the application of our products in the storage and computer consumer electronics communications and industrial markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

  

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors 

  

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets 

  

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

  

   

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

  

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct sales or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and valueadded reseller agreements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 91 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including 

  

   

   

   

     

 

 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and financial condition 

  

we depend on a limited number of customers including distributors for a significant percentage of our revenue 

  

historically we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers including distributors for example sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 24 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenue a decrease in demand for our products from any of our major customers for any reason including due to market conditions catastrophic events or otherwise could have a materially adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 

  

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which places us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements valueadded resellers and direct customers and the loss of any one of these distributors valueadded resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

  

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers “emss” receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 24 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply commitments 

  

 

 

  

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or an oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

  

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

  

our ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

  

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  as a result this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations delays in increasing thirdparty manufacturing capacity may also limit our ability to meet customer demand 

  

we currently depend on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable andor fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

  

we have a supply arrangement with certain suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management of relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

  

we do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as global economic crises may materially impact our assembly suppliers’ ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

 

    

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our thirdparty suppliers’ manufacturing capacity 

  

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops and testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities such activities are subject to a number of risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty suppliers’ capacity 

  

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

  

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from third party manufacturers in advance of selling our product we place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the timeframe that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigation or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be disposed of or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items such as future exercises or dispositions of stock options and restricted stock releases in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities for example our us federal income tax returns for the years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2007 were examined by the irs we reached a resolution on the audits in april 2015 and recorded a onetime net charge of 27 million to our income tax provision in the second quarter of 2015 we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

  

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision we have hired independent tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our independent tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which if material would result in us having to restate our financial statements restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

  

 

 

    

if we experience security breaches of our information technology systems that materially damage sensitive information on our networks our business partner and customer relationships may be harmed and our business and operating results may be adversely impacted 

  

in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data on our internal systems network and servers such as proprietary business and financial information and confidential data pertaining to our customers suppliers and business partners the secure maintenance of sensitive information on our networks and the protection features of our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy we devote significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data however these security measures cannot provide absolute security although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and solutions any destructive or intrusive breach could compromise our networks creating system disruptions or slowdowns and the information stored on our networks could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen if any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data our relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially damaged our reputation could be materially harmed and we could be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible significant liability 

  

if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

  

from time to time we are party to various legal proceedings if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be significant we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products and our products and our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

  

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publicly disclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

  

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in us incurring unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be materially impacted 

  

future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses our financial condition could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could divert management’s attention from focusing on our operations and adversely affect our business 

  

we will continue to vigorously defend and enforce our intellectual property rights around the world especially as it relates to patent litigation 

  

from time to time we are faced with having to defend our intellectual property rights throughout the world should we become engaged in such proceedings it could divert management’s attention from focusing on and implementing our business strategy further should we not be successful in any of our intellectual property enforcement actions our revenue may be affected and our business could be harmed 

  

 

 

    

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies would materially harm our business 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities has suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days became illiquid in 2008 we experienced our first failed auction in midfebruary 2008 since 2008 we have redeemed 87 of the original portfolio at par at december 31 2015 56 million of our auctionrate securities have failed to reset through successful auctions and it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 32 years 

  

we recorded temporary and otherthantemporary impairment charges on these investments the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the quality of underlying collateral estimated time for liquidity including potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty and market conditions among others 

  

should there be further deterioration in the market for auctionrate securities the value of our portfolio may decline which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our earnings if the accounting rules for these securities change there may be an adverse impact on our earnings 

  

 

 

    

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting 

  

effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct our business and operating results could be harmed our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and could subject us to stockholder litigation in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

  

our products must meet specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

  

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is generally one to two years which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

  

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

  

the price and availability of commodities eg gold copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our products incorporate commodities such as gold copper and silicon an increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the renminbi may adversely affect results of operations 

  

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future if the value of the renminbi rises against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition our sales are primarily denominated in the us dollar if the value of the us dollar rises against other currencies it may adversely affect the demand for our products in international markets which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the timing of payments for transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries which are reported in interest and other income in the statements of operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the amount of foreign currency exchange losses we record which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

  

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

  

most of our manufacturing partners are located in china in addition we have established manufacturing and testing facilities in china the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from timetotime to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

 

 

    

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facilities in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing and testing facilities in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

  

we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china that began operations in 2006 we face the following risks among others with respect to our operations in china 

  

   

   

   

if we are unable to maintain our facilities in china at fully operational status with qualified workers appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profits 

  

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own wafer manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our profit margins 

  

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

  

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures may be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it generally takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

  

 

 

    

our success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

  

our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development we expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and come to market with new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability if we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results also if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources we could see material adverse effects on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

in addition if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 

  

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could affect our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands of our business including design cycles our business could be harmed furthermore if we experience loss of a member of key personnel the search for a qualified replacement and the transition could cause interruptions to our operations as it could take us take longer than expected on the search and divert management resources or the newly hired member could take longer than expected to integrate into the team 

  

if we fail to retain key employees in our sales applications finance and legal staff or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

  

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal staff maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal control that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

  

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

  

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships andor acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

 

 

    

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire in addition acquisitions could result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders reduce our cash balances and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities which could adversely affect our business 

  

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities for example we completed our acquisition of sensima technology sa in july 2014 to further our diversification strategy and create new opportunities with key customers as a result of completing acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities and incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangibles such actions could impact our operating results and the price of our common stock for example as part of the contingent consideration arrangement that was part of our acquisition of sensima we may have to pay up to an additional 89 million to former sensima shareholders if sensima achieves a new product introduction as well as certain product revenue and direct margin targets in 2016 the fair value of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date of 25 million was recorded in other longterm liabilities in our financial statements and is remeasured at the end of each reporting period during the fourth quarter of 2015 we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration was 0 and released the liability of 25 million as we currently do not expect the milestones will be achieved we will continue to assess the probability of former sensmia shareholders earning the contingent consideration in 2016 and may record additional adjustment to the fair value 

  

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings 

  

we cannot guarantee that the sensima acquisition or any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with many manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate 

  

 

 

    

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

  

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

  

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer suppliers our ic testing and manufacturing facilities a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia particularly in china such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k 

  

overview 

  

we are a leading company in high performance power solutions founded in 1997 we design and provide small highly energy efficient easytouse power solutions for systems found in industrial applications telecommunication infrastructures cloud computing automotive and consumer applications our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers systems with green practical compact solutions we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families as well as in new innovative product categories 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance 

  

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits “ics” this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths 

  

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult 

  

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia where the products we produce are incorporated into enduser products our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia was 91 91 and 90 for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which serves the communications storage and computing consumer and industrial markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

in july 2014 we completed the acquisition of sensima technology sa “sensima” a company located in switzerland that develops magnetic sensors for angle measurements as well as threedimensional magnetic field sensing sensima became a subsidiary of mps and changed its name to mps tech switzerland sarl the acquisition creates new opportunities with customers by offering enhanced solutions in power management for key industries such as automotive industrial and cloud computing the purchase consideration consisted of an upfront cash payment of 117 million and additional consideration that is contingent upon sensima achieving a new product introduction and certain revenue and direct margin goals in 2016 with a fair value of 25 million at the date of acquisition in addition key employees received 17 million of timebased restricted stock units and up to 80 million of performancebased restricted stock units in connection with the transaction these equity awards are considered arrangements for postacquisition services and the related compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance goals will be met the results of operations of sensima have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation inventories income taxes valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates 

  

 

 

    

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fees charged for products delivered and the collectability of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in us generally recognizing revenue upon shipment when title and risk of loss have transferred to customers including distributors original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers 

  

our revenue consists primarily of sales of assembled and tested finished goods we also sell die in wafer form to our customers and valueadded resellers and we receive royalty revenue from third parties and valueadded resellers 

  

for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 approximately 96 92 and 91 of our distributor sales respectively including sales to our valueadded resellers were made through distribution arrangements with third parties these arrangements generally do not include any special payment terms our normal payment terms are 3045 days for our distributors price protection or exchange rights returns are limited to our standard product warranty certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases 

  

for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 approximately 4 8 and 9 of our distributor sales respectively were made through small distributors primarily based on purchase orders these distributors typically have no stock rotation rights 

  

we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the distributors based on the following considerations 

  

   

we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per distributor basis where available and information related to products in the distribution channel this reserve is recorded at the time of sale historically these returns were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

  

if we enter into arrangements that have rights of return that are not estimable we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributors have sold the products to end customers four of our distributors have distribution agreements where revenue is recognized upon sale by these distributors to their end customers because these distributors have certain rights of return which management believes are not estimable the deferred revenue balance from these distributors as of december 31 2015 and 2014 was 28 million and 20 million respectively the deferred costs as of december 31 2015 and 2014 were 02 million

we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required conversely if market conditions are more favorable inventory may be sold that was previously reserved 

  

 

 

      

valuation of goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

we evaluate intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist we perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist impairment of intangible assets is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the assets and their carrying value impairment for goodwill occurs if the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill is less than its carrying value and is recognized based on the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill the assumptions and estimates used to determine future value of goodwill and intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and revenue forecasts if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future including macroeconomic and market conditions we may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

accounting for income taxes   

  

we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure 

  

as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had a valuation allowance of 186 million and 191 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets in the us will not be realized should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

  

as a result of the cost sharing arrangements with our international subsidiaries cost share arrangements relatively small changes in costs that are not subject to sharing under the cost share arrangements can significantly impact the overall profitability of the us entity because of the us entity’s inconsistent earnings history and uncertainty of future earnings we have determined that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax benefits will not be realized 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business including litigation regarding our shareholders and our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and employment matters the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations 

  

 

 

    

stockbased compensation 

 

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award   the fair value of restricted stock units with service conditions or performance conditions is based on the grant date share price the fair value of restricted stock units with market conditions as well as restricted stock units with both market conditions and performance conditions is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model the fair value of options and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the blackscholes model 

  

we recognize compensation expense equal to the grantdate fair value for all sharebased payment awards that are expected to vest this expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the entire awards unless the awards are subject to market conditions or performance conditions in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche for awards with performance conditions as well as awards with both market conditions and performance conditions we recognize compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance criteria set by the board of directors will be achieved this assessment is performed on a quarterly basis and requires significant assumptions and estimates made by management related to the projected achievement of the performance goals which can be affected by external factors such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry forecasts and internal factors such as our business and operations strategy product roadmaps and revenue forecasts changes in the probability assessment of achieving the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catchup adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date if the actual performance targets achieved differ significantly from those projected by management additional compensation expense may be recorded for the performancebased awards due to the cumulative catchup adjustment which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations furthermore the amount of compensation expense that we recognize is based on an expected forfeiture rate if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stockbased compensation costs and the actual forfeitures which become known over time we may change the forfeiture rate which could have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers   which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers the standard’s core principle is that an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in july 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of the effective date the standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 the standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption we are evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows and disclosures 

  

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  which requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities including related valuation allowance be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheets we have elected to early adopt the standard as of december 31 2015 on a retrospective basis as of december 31 2014 we reclassified 02 million of current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheet the adoption did not affect our operating results comprehensive income or cash flows for the periods presented

revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 was 3331 million an increase of 506 million or 179 from 2825 million for the year ended december 31 2014 this increase was due to higher sales of both dc to dc and lighting control products as unit shipments increased 17 due to higher market demand with current customers and additional design wins with new customers coupled with an increase of 1 in average sales prices revenue from our dc to dc products was 2997 million for the year ended december 31 2015 an increase of 466 million or 184 from the same period in 2014 this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our dc to dc converters and battery chargers which were offset in part by lower sales of our minimonsters products revenue from our lighting control products was 333 million for the year ended december 31 2015 an increase of 39 million or 132 compared with the same period in 2014 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 was 2825 million an increase of 444 million or 187 from 2381 million for the year ended december 31 2013 this increase was due to higher sales of both dc to dc and lighting control products as unit shipments increased 37 due to higher market demand with current customers and additional design wins with new customers which were offset in part by a 13 decrease in average sales prices revenue from our dc to dc products was 2531 million for the year ended december 31 2014 an increase of 417 million or 198 from the same period in 2013 this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our dc to dc converters offset in part by lower sales of our minimonsters products revenue from our lighting control products was 295 million for the year ended december 31 2014 an increase of 27 million or 101 compared with the same period in 2013

gross margin was 541 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared with 540 for the year ended december 31 2014 for the year ended december 31 2015 gross margin was favorably impacted by lower labor and overhead costs as a percentage of revenue partially offset by increased sales of lower margin products and higher amortization of intangible assets compared to the same period in 2014 

  

cost of revenue was 1299 million or 460 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 1102 million or 463 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 the 197 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 37 increase in unit shipments which was partially offset by a 14 decrease in the average direct cost of units shipped the increase in cost of revenue was also driven by an increase of 08 million in the provision for inventory reserve and additional amortization of intangible assets of 07 million 

  

 

 

    

gross margin was 540 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 537 for the year ended december 31 2013 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor and overhead costs as a percentage of revenue compared to the same period in 2013 this increase was partially offset by an increase in the provision for inventory reserve and higher amortization of intangible assets

our acquisition of senisma in july 2014 included a contingent consideration arrangement which requires us to pay up to 89 million to certain former sensima shareholders if sensima achieves a new product introduction as well as certain product revenue and direct margin targets in 2016 the fair value of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date was 25 million which was estimated based on a probabilityweighted analysis of possible future revenue outcomes as part of the quarterly assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015 management reviewed the sales forecast for the products and concluded that the projected product revenue in 2016 will not likely meet the minimum target required to earn the contingent consideration primarily because the product adoption process by customers will take longer than we had originally anticipated accordingly the fair value of the contingent consideration was deemed to be 0 as of december 31 2015 and we recorded the release of the liability of 25 million as a credit to sga expenses we will continue to assess the probability of former sensima shareholders earning the contingent consideration in 2016 and may record additional adjustment to the fair value

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and shortterm investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months we anticipate the cash used for future dividends dividend equivalents and the stock repurchase program will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing us operations if cash held by our international subsidiaries is needed for these payments we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 

  

in the future in order to strengthen our financial position respond to unforeseen circumstances or fund our growth in future financial periods we may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities issuing debt or convertible debt securities incurring indebtedness secured by our assets or selling certain product lines andor portions of our business there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines technologies businesses and companies and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities assumptions of debt andor payment of cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisitions through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2015   

 

  

       

off balance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2015 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of the securities and exchange commission’s regulation sk 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities fluctuations in interest rates of 10 would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

 

 

    

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale for availableforsale investments no gains or losses are recognized by us in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired availableforsale investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

longterm investments 

  

as of december 31 2015 all of our holdings in auctionrate securities which have a face value of 56 million have failed to reset as a result of current market conditions should these auctions continue to fail and if the credit rating for these securities decline a 10 decline in the fair value could impact our results of operations by approximately 05 million if we determine the decline in value to be otherthantemporary 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our sales outside the united states are primarily transacted in us dollars accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes the functional currency of the company’s offshore operations is the local currency primarily the renminbi the new taiwan dollar and the euro in addition we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the timing of payments for transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries which are reported in interest and other income to date fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control—integrated framework   2013   issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2015 management reviewed the results of its assessment with our audit committee 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2015 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures 

  

in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs

monolithic power systems inc 

san jose california 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of monolithic power systems inc and subsidiaries the company as of december 31 2015 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 based on the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

industry overview 

  

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or as ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for ‘high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics ‘high performance’ products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish analog and mixedsignal ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market from digital ic markets these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have however targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

acquisition 

  

in july 2014 we completed the acquisition of sensima technology sa “sensima” a company based in switzerland that develops magnetic sensors for angle measurement as well as threedimensional magnetic field sensing sensima’s products are based on hall devices that are directly integrated with the signal treatment and instantaneously detect and deliver the angle value in digital format their angle sensors are used in rotary encoders electronically commutated motors and a broad range of products by combining sensima’s real time precision magnetic angle sensing with our technologies we expect to create new opportunities with customers by offering enhanced solutions in power management for key industries such as automotive industrial and cloud computing 

  

for a detailed discussion of the terms of the acquisition please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

  products and applications 

  

we currently have two primary product families that address multiple applications within the storage and computing consumer electronics communications and industrialautomotive markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

  

direct current dc to dc products dc to dc ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers set top boxes tvs and monitors automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc products are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current high switching speed and small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices the dc to dc product family accounted for 90 89 and 88 of our total revenue in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively     

  

 

 

  

  lighting control products and acdc offline solutions lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers lcd monitors car navigation systems and lcd televisions backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode wled lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfl wled lighting control ics stepup or stepdown a dc voltage or convert from an ac line voltage supplied by the utility company also called acdc offline and provide efficient precision power and protection to a led string or to multiple led strings the ccfl ics function by converting lowvoltage direct current dc or battery voltage to highvoltage alternating current ac we believe our ccfl ics were the first to utilize a full bridge resonant topology that allows for high efficiency extended lifetimes for ccfls and lower signal interference with adjacent components the full bridge topology is now the industry standard for these products the lighting control product family accounted for 10 11 and 12 of our total revenue in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

in addition to acdc offline solutions for lighting illumination applications we also offer acdc power conversion solutions for a diverse number of end products that plug into a wall outlet 

  

we currently target our products at the consumer electronics communications storage and computing and industrial markets with the consumer electronics market representing the largest portion of our revenue 

  

the following is a brief summary of our product family for various applications for each of these applications we are currently shipping products or have design wins which are decisions by original equipment manufacturers oems or original design manufacturers odms to use our ics 

  

   

we derive a majority of our revenue from our dc to dc ic product family sold to the consumer electronics communications storage and computing and industrial markets in the future we will continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families such as high current high voltage small form factor switching voltage regulators as well as expand our newer product families in battery chargers voltage references and low dropout regulators our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of china taiwan and other asian markets expand our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

for a detailed discussion of our revenue by product family please refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

 

 

  

customers sales and marketing 

  

we sell our products through third party distributors valueadded resellers and directly to oems odms and electronic manufacturing service ems providers our third party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors may distribute our products to end customers which include oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers 

  

sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 26 of revenue in 2014 32 of revenue in 2013 and 32 of revenue in 2012 in addition one other distributor accounted for 10 of revenue in 2013 no other customers accounted for more than 10 of revenue in any periods presented 

  

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor shall have the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

  

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china korea and japan and have marketing representatives in europe and singapore our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems’ electronics containing our products 

  

because our sales are billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are not directly subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because a majority of our revenue is attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 approximately 91 90 and 89 of our revenue was from customers in asia respectively 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped our manufacturing lead times are generally 4 to 12 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount take a significant writedown or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in the united states and china with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products in the area of process technology we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technology is a key strategic component to our future growth 

  

our research and development expenses totaled 586 million 497 million and 488 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

  

 

 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 1172 patentsapplications issued or pending of which 223 patents have been issued in the united states our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2034 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights for a more complete description of our legal matters please read note 13 to our consolidated financial statements patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies who utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technology on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our integrated circuits 

  

we currently contract with three suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in china and malaysia the assembled ics are then sent for final testing primarily at our chengdu facility prior to shipping to our customers 

  

in september 2004 we entered into a lease arrangement for our manufacturing facility located in chengdu china we have the option to acquire the facility for approximately 16 million which consists of total construction costs minus total rent paid by us during the lease term this option became exercisable in march 2011 we may exercise our purchase option and enter into a purchase agreement for this facility in the future the facility has been fully operational since 2006 and we have benefitted from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs we have expanded our product testing capabilities in our china facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations 

  

in addition we constructed a 150000 squarefoot research and development facility in chengdu china which was put into operation in october 2010 

  

key personnel and employees 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would materially harm our business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2014 we employed 1178 employees located in the united states taiwan china japan korea europe and singapore 

  

  

 

 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices fairchild semiconductor international rectifier intersil corporation linear technology maxim integrated products micrel inc microchip technology microsemi corporation o2 micro international on semiconductor power integrations inc richtek technology corporation rohm co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated 

  

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business involves risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

 

 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the stock market often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

  

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

 

 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and results of operations and may cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

  

our business has been and may continue to be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions and uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy makes it more likely that our actual results will differ materially from expectations 

  

in recent years global credit and financial markets experienced disruptions and may continue to experience disruptions in the future including diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and continued uncertainty about economic stability these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the continued or further tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish liquidity and capital availability demand for consumer electronics is a function of the health of the economies in the united states europe china and the rest of the world we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic disruption or subsequent economic recovery worldwide in the united states in our industry or in the consumer electronics market these and other economic factors have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

  

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

  

our profitability is dependent on many factors including 

  

   

  

 

 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in our operations including any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability 

  

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

  

in the past our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products due to various factors including increased competition loss of certain of our customers unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and ongoing litigation we may not experience growth rates comparable to past periods which could materially and adversely affect our stock price and results of operations 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

  

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above industry averages should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

  

we believe that the application of our products in the storage and computer consumer electronics communications and industrial markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

  

  

 

 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

  

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors 

  

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets 

  

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

  

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct sales or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and valueadded reseller agreements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 91 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

 

 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and financial condition 

  

we depend on a limited number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue 

  

historically we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers for example sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 26 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenue a decrease in demand for our products from any of our major customers for any reason including due to market conditions catastrophic events or otherwise could have a materially adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 

  

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which places us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements valueadded resellers and direct customers and the loss of any one of these distributors valueadded resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

  

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and emss receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 26 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply commitments 

  

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

 

 

  

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

  

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

  

our ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

  

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  as a result this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

  

we currently depend on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable andor fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

  

we have a supply arrangement with certain suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management of relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

  

we do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as the recent global economic crisis may materially impact our assembly suppliers’ ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

  

 

 

  

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our thirdparty suppliers’ manufacturing capacity 

  

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops and testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities such activities are subject to a number of risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty suppliers’ capacity 

  

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

  

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from third party manufacturers in advance of selling our product we place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the timeframe that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigations or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be disposed of or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position 

  

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs and foreign tax authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities our us federal income tax returns for the years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2007 are under examination by the irs in april 2011 we received from the irs a notice of proposed adjustment or nopa relating to a costsharing agreement entered into by us and our international subsidiaries on january 1 2004 in the nopa the irs objected to our allocation of certain litigation expenses between us and our international subsidiaries and the amount of buyin payments made by our international subsidiaries to us in connection with the costsharing agreement and proposed to increase our us taxable income according to a few alternative methodologies in february 2012 we received a revised nopa from the irs revised nopa in this revised nopa the irs raised the same issues as in the nopa issued in april 2011 but under a different methodology under the revised nopa the largest potential federal income tax payment if the irs were to prevail on all matters in dispute is 105 million plus interest and penalties if any we responded to the irs revised nopa in may 2012 in june 2013 the irs responded and continued to disagree with our rebuttal we met with the irs office of appeals in 2014 had additional discussions again in 2015 and both parties have been in continuous discussions for a resolution of the matter however there is no guarantee these discussions will be conclusive meanwhile we agreed to grant the irs an extension of the statute of limitations for taxable years 2005 through 2007 to september 30 2015 

  

the irs also audited the research and development credits carried forward into year 2005 and the credits generated in the years 2005 through 2007 we received a nopa from the irs in february 2011 proposing to reduce the research and development credits generated in years 2005 through 2007 and the carryforwards which would then reduce the value of such credits carried forward to subsequent tax years 

  

  

 

 

  

we have reviewed and responded to the above proposed adjustments we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes based on the technical merits of our tax return filing positions and the interactions to date with the irs we believe that it is more likely than not that the resolution of these audits will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items such as future exercises or dispositions of stock options and restricted stock releases in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

  

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision we have hired independent tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our independent tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which would result in us having to restate our financial statements restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

  

if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

  

from time to time we are party to various legal proceedings if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be significant we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products and our products and our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

  

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publiclydisclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

  

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in our incurrence of unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be impacted 

  

future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses our financial condition could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed in addition our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could divert management’s attention from focusing on our operations and adversely affect our business 

  

  

 

 

  

we will continue to vigorously defend and enforce our intellectual property rights around the world especially as it relates to patent litigation 

  

from time to time we are faced with having to defend our intellectual property rights throughout the world should we become engaged in such proceedings it could divert management’s attention from focusing on and implementing our business strategy further should we not be successful in any of our intellectual property enforcement actions our revenue may be affected and our business could be harmed 

  

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies would materially harm our business 

  

the downgrade of the credit rating for us longterm sovereign debt and that of certain eurozone countries could affect global and domestic financial markets which may affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

  

although a downgrade of longterm sovereign credit ratings is not unprecedented a downgrade of the us credit rating is and the potential impact is uncertain management will continue to monitor the situation and there could be future changes in capital requirements or a rebalancing of investment portfolios in response to management’s assessment of the related risk weightings at this time however us treasuries continue to trade in active markets and the yield curve on us treasuries remains an appropriate basis for determining riskfree rates 

  

should there be a deterioration of the global and financial markets as a result of the downgraded credit rating for us longterm sovereign debt and that of certain eurozone countries our business financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities has suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days became illiquid in 2008 we experienced our first failed auction in midfebruary 2008 since 2008 we have redeemed 87 of the original portfolio at par at december 31 2014 56 million of our auctionrate security investments have failed to reset through successful auctions and it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 33 years 

  

we recorded temporary and otherthantemporary impairment charges on these investments the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the quality of underlying collateral estimated time for liquidity including potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty and market conditions among others 

  

should there be further deterioration in the market for auctionrate securities the value of our portfolio may decline which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our earnings if the accounting rules for these securities change there may be an adverse impact on our earnings 

  

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting 

  

effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct our business and operating results could be harmed our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and could subject us to stockholder litigation in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

  

  

 

 

  

our products must meet specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

  

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is generally one to two years which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

  

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

  

the price and availability of commodities eg gold copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our products incorporate commodities such as gold copper and silicon an increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the renminbi may adversely affect results of operations 

  

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future if the value of the renminbi rises against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition because we collect payments from all customers in us dollars fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could have an adverse impact on our customers’ business which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the timing of payments between the us and our foreign subsidiaries which are reported in interest and other income fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could increase the amount of foreign currency exchange losses we record which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

  

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

  

most of our manufacturing partners are located in china in addition we have established a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facility in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

  

 

 

  

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our testing facility in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

  

we have a testing facility in china that began operations in 2006 we face the following risks among others with respect to our testing facility in china 

  

   

   

   

if we are unable to maintain our testing facility in china at fully operational status with qualified workers appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profits 

  

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our profit margins 

  

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

  

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures must be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

  

  

 

 

  

our success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

  

our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development we expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and come to market with new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability if we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results also if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources we could see material adverse effects on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

in addition if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 

  

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands of our business including design cycles our business could be harmed 

  

if we fail to retain key employees in sales applications finance and legal or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

  

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal staff maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal control that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

  

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

  

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships andor acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire in addition acquisitions could result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders reduce our cash balances and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities which could adversely affect our business 

  

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities for example we completed our acquisition of sensima technology sa in july 2014 to further our diversification strategy and create new opportunities with key customers as a result of completing acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities and incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles such actions could impact our operating results and the price of our common stock 

  

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings 

  

  

 

 

  

we cannot guarantee that the sensima acquisition or any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate 

  

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

  

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

  

 

 

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

  

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer suppliers our ic testing facility a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts 

  

in june 2014 the board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock we anticipate the cash used for future dividends will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing us operations if cash held by our international subsidiaries is needed for the payment of dividends we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 

  

the declaration of cash dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors any future decision to declare and pay a cash dividend on our common stock will be subject to among other things our results of operations cash balances and future cash requirements financial condition statutory requirements of delaware law compliance with the terms of future indebtedness and credit facilities and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant our dividend payments may change from time to time and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear under item 8 in this annual report on form 10k 

  

overview 

  

we are a leading company in high performance power solutions founded in 1997 we pioneered integrated power semiconductor solutions and power delivery architectures our mission is to provide innovative power solutions in cloud computing telecommunications industrial and automotive and consumer market segments we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families as well as in new innovative product categories 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance 

  

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits “ics” this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths 

  

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult 

  

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia where the products we produce are incorporated into enduser products our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia was 91 and 90 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which services the communications storage and computing consumer and industrial markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

in july 2014 we completed the acquisition of sensima technology sa “sensima” a company located in switzerland that develops magnetic sensors for angle measurements as well as threedimensional magnetic field sensing the acquisition is expected to create new opportunities with customers by offering enhanced solutions in power management for key industries such as automotive industrial and cloud computing the purchase consideration consisted of an upfront cash payment of 117 million and additional consideration that is contingent upon sensima achieving a new product introduction and certain revenue and direct margin goals in 2016 with a fair value of 25 million at the date of acquisition in addition key employees received 17 million of timebased restricted stock units and up to 80 million of performancebased restricted stock units in connection with the transaction these equity awards are considered arrangements for postacquisition services and the related compensation expense is being recognized over the requisite service period the results of operations of sensima have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation inventories income taxes valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

  

 

 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fees charged for products delivered and the collectability of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in us generally recognizing revenue upon shipment when title passes to customers including distributors original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers 

  

our revenue consists primarily of sales of assembled and tested finished goods we also sell die in wafer form to our customers and valueadded resellers and we receive royalty revenue from third parties and valueadded resellers 

  

for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 92 and 91 of our distributor sales respectively including sales to our valueadded resellers were made through distribution arrangements with third parties these arrangements do not include any special payment terms normal payment terms are 3045 days for our distributors price protection or exchange rights returns are limited to our standard product warranty certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases 

  

for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 8 and 9 of our distributor sales respectively were made through small distributors primarily based on purchase orders these distributors typically have no stock rotation rights 

  

we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the distributors for the following reasons 

  

   

we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per distributor basis where available and information related to products in the distribution channel this reserve is recorded at the time of sale historically these returns were not material to our consolidated financial statements in the future if we are not able to estimate our stock rotation returns accurately we may have to recognize revenue when the distributors sell such inventory to end customers 

  

  if we enter into arrangements that have rights of return that are not estimable we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributors have sold the products to end customers three of our us distributors have distribution agreements where revenue is recognized upon sale by these distributors to their end customers because these distributors have certain rights of return which management believes are not estimable the deferred revenue balance from these distributors as of december 31 2014 and 2013 was 20 million and 17 million respectively the deferred costs as of december 31 2014 and 2013 were 02 million 

  

we generally provide a one to twoyear warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under this warranty we will repair the goods provide replacements at no charge or under certain circumstances provide a refund to the customer for defective products estimated warranty returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 

  

inventory valuation 

  

we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required conversely if market conditions are more favorable inventory may be sold that was previously reserved 

  

  

 

 

  

valuation of goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

we evaluate intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist we perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist impairment of intangible assets is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the assets and their carrying value impairment for goodwill occurs if the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill is less than its carrying value and is recognized based on the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values of goodwill and intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and revenue forecasts if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future including macroeconomic and market conditions we may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill and acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

accounting for income taxes   

  

asc 74010  income taxes – overall  prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure in accordance with asc 74010 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure 

  

as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had a valuation allowance of 191 million and 167 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets in the us will not be realized should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

  

as a result of the cost sharing arrangements with our international subsidiaries cost share arrangements relatively small changes in costs that are not subject to sharing under the cost share arrangements can significantly impact the overall profitability of the us entity because of the us entity’s inconsistent earnings history and uncertainty of future earnings we have determined that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax benefits will not be realized 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a party to actions and proceedings incident to our business in the ordinary course of business including litigation regarding our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property and claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations 

  

  

 

 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award   we use the blackscholes model to estimate the fair value of our options and shares issued under employee stock purchase plan the fair value of timebased and performancebased restricted stock units is based on the grant date share price the fair value of marketbased restricted stock units is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model 

  

we recognize compensation expense equal to the grantdate fair value for all sharebased payment awards that are expected to vest this expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the entire awards unless the awards are subject to performance or market conditions in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche for the performancebased awards we recognize compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance criteria set by the board of directors will be achieved for the marketbased awards compensation expense is not reversed if the market condition is not satisfied if the actual performance targets achieved differ significantly from those projected by management additional stockbased compensation expense may be recorded for the performancebased awards which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations furthermore the amount of stockbased compensation that we recognize is based on an expected forfeiture rate if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stockbased compensation costs and the actual forfeitures which become known over time we may change the forfeiture rate which could have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in july 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201311 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists  the standard gives guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists with the purpose of reducing diversity in practice this new standard requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions we adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2014 prospectively and the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers   which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers the standard’s core principle is that an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services under the new standard entities will apply the following fivestep model when evaluating revenue contracts with customers 

  

       

the new standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective application in the adoption of this standard we will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2017 and are evaluating the transition method and the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

  

 

 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes our results of operations 

 

   

revenue 

  

the following table summarizes our revenue by product family 

  

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 was 2825 million an increase of 444 million or 187 from 2381 million for the year ended december 31 2013 this increase was due to higher sales of both dc to dc and lighting control products as unit shipments increased 37 due to higher market demand with current customers and additional design wins with new customers which were offset in part by a 13 decrease in average sales prices revenue from our dc to dc products was 2531 million for the year ended december 31 2014 an increase of 417 million or 198 from the same period in 2013 this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our dc to dc converters offset in part by lower sales of our minimonsters products revenue from our lighting control products was 295 million for the year ended december 31 2014 an increase of 27 million or 101 compared with the same period in 2013 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 was 2381 million an increase of 243 million or 114 from 2138 million for the year ended december 31 2012 this increase was due to higher sales of both dc to dc and lighting control products as unit shipments increased 18 due to higher market demand with current customers and additional design wins with new customers which were offset in part by a 6 decrease in average sales prices revenue from our dc to dc products was 2113 million for the year ended december 31 2013 an increase of 226 million or 120 from the same period in 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our dc to dc converters minimonsters pmics and battery charger products revenue from our lighting control products was 268 million for the year ended december 31 2013 an increase of 17 million or 67 compared with the same period in 2012 

  

  

 

 

  

cost of revenue and gross margin   

  

cost of revenue consists primarily of costs incurred to manufacture assemble and test our products as well as warranty costs inventoryrelated expenses and other overhead costs and stockbased compensation expenses in addition cost of revenue includes amortization of intangible assets from the sensima acquisition beginning in the third quarter of 2014 

 

   

cost of revenue was 1299 million or 460 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 1102 million or 463 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 the 197 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 37 increase in unit shipments which was partially offset by a 14 decrease in the average direct cost of units shipped in addition the increase in cost of revenue was driven by an increase of 08 million in the provision for inventory reserve and an increase of 07 million in amortization of intangible assets from the sensima acquisition in july 2014 

  

gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin was 540 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 537 for the year ended december 31 2013 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher absorption of inhouse test manufacturing overhead compared to the same period in 2013 this increase was partially offset by an increase in the provision for inventory reserve and an increase in the amortization of intangible assets from the sensima acquisition in july 2014 

  

cost of revenue was 1102 million or 463 of revenue for the year ended december 2013 and 1007 million or 471 of revenue for the year ended december 2012 the 95 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an 18 increase in unit shipments which was partially offset by an 8 decrease in the average direct cost of units shipped the increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by a decrease of 05 million in the provision for inventory reserve 

  

gross margin was 537 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 529 for the year ended december 31 2012 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of higher margin products and a lower provision for inventory reserve this increase was partially offset by lower absorption of inhouse test manufacturing overhead 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expenses primarily consist of salary and benefit expenses bonuses and stockbased compensation expenses for design and product engineers expenses related to new product development and supplies and facility costs 

  

  

rd expenses were 586 million or 207 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 497 million or 209 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 the 89 million increase in rd expenses was primarily due to an increase of 28 million in stockbased compensation expenses primarily associated with the performancebased and marketbased equity awards an increase of 24 million in new product development expenses an increase of 20 million in cash compensation expenses which include salary benefits and bonuses and an increase of 06 million in manufacturing and laboratory supplies our rd headcount was 476 employees as of december 31 2014 compared with 449 employees as of december 31 2013 

  

rd expenses were 497 million or 209 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 and 488 million or 228 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 the 09 million increase in rd expenses was primarily due to an increase of 16 million in depreciation expense and an increase of 07 million in cash compensation expenses which include salary benefits and bonuses these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 07 million in stockbased compensation expenses primarily due to the cancellation of certain performancebased equity awards our rd headcount was 449 employees as of december 31 2013 compared with 388 employees as of december 31 2012

for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 interest and other income net was 11 million 01 million and 06 million respectively interest and other income net increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange losses and higher interest income in 2014 compared to 2013 interest and other income net decreased from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange losses and lower interest income in 2013 compared to 2012 

  

income tax provision 

  

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2014 was 09 million or 25 of our income before income taxes this differs from the federal statutory rate primarily because our foreign income was taxed at lower rates and because of the benefit that we realized as a result of stock options exercised and restricted units released and changes in our valuation allowance during the year

liquidity and capital resources 

 

   

as of december 31 2014 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1263 million and shortterm investments of 1125 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of 1012 million and shortterm investments of 1251 million as of december 31 2013 as of december 31 2014 564 million of cash and cash equivalents and 358 million of shortterm investments were held by our international subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds however our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

  

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable inventories prepaid expenses and other current assets reduced by accounts payable accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities as of december 31 2014 we had working capital of 2713 million compared with working capital of 2536 million as of december 31 2013 the 177 million increase in working capital was due to a 161 million increase in current assets and a 16 million decrease in current liabilities the increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents an increase in inventory and an increase in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in shortterm investments the decrease in current liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits and a decrease in other accrued liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 

  

summary of cash flows   

  

the following table summarizes our cash flow activities 

  

  

  

 

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2014 net cash provided by operating activities was 741 million primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation and a net decrease of 80 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher sales and an increase in shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014 the increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in strategic wafer and die bank inventories as well as an increase in finished goods necessary to meet anticipated future demand the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet anticipated future demand the decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by the release of the liability related to the o2 micro litigation partially offset by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan for the year ended december 31 2013 net cash provided by operating activities was 607 million primarily due to cash contributed from our operating results during the year and the cash payment received in connection with the o2 micro litigation recorded as a liability as of december 31 2013 these increases were partially offset by increases in both inventories and accounts receivable the increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from an increase in shipments the increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in strategic wafer and die bank inventories as well as finished goods to meet anticipated future demand for the year ended december 31 2012 net cash provided by operating activities was 249 million primarily reflecting cash contributed from our operating results partially offset by 278 million increase in working capital requirements 

  

for the year ended december 31 2014 net cash used in investing activities was 94 million primarily due to net cash of 116 million paid to acquire sensima purchases of property and equipment of 95 million and net purchases of investments of 71 million partially offset by proceeds of 47 million from the redemption of auctionrate securities for the year ended december 31 2013 net cash used in investing activities was 543 million primarily reflecting net purchases of shortterm investments and purchases of property and equipment partially offset by proceeds from the redemption of auctionrate securities for the year ended december 31 2012 net cash used in investing activities was 268 million related to our investment in equipment building improvements at our new headquarters located in san jose california and net purchases of shortterm investments partially offset by proceeds from the redemption of auctionrate securities 

  

for the year ended december 31 2014 net cash used in financing activities was 392 million primarily reflecting 412 million used in repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and 117 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold restricted stock units “rsus” partially offset by 140 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december 31 2013 net cash provided by financing activities was 189 million primarily reflecting 400 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan partially offset by 206 million used in repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program for the year ended december 31 2012 net cash used in financing activities was 196 million primarily reflecting the 357 million cash dividends paid to stockholders on december 28 2012 partially offset by 152 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan 

  

in july 2013 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes us to repurchase up to 100 million in the aggregate of our common stock through june 30 2015 all shares are retired upon repurchase for the year ended december 31 2014 we repurchased a total of 11 million shares for 412 million at an average price of 3919 per share for the year ended december 31 2013 we repurchased a total of 07 million shares for 206 million at an average price of 3106 per share as of december 31 2014 382 million remained available for future repurchases under the program 

  

in june 2014 our board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock in addition rsu awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents which entitle employees who hold rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock dividend equivalents accrued on the rsus are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement during the vesting periods for the year ended december 31 2014 we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling 117 million in addition our board of directors authorized dividend payments totaling 58 million to stockholders of record on december 31 2014 which will be paid on january 15 2015 

  

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and shortterm investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months we anticipate the cash used for future dividends dividend equivalents and the stock repurchase program will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing us operations if cash held by our international subsidiaries is needed for these payments we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 

  

in the future in order to strengthen our financial position in the event of unforeseen circumstances or in the event we need to fund our growth in future financial periods we may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities issuing debt or convertible debt securities incurring indebtedness secured by our assets or selling certain product lines andor portions of our business there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines technologies businesses and companies and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities assumptions of debt andor payment of cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisition through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 

 

 

 

 

  

contractual obligations  

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2014 in thousands 

  

  

   

   

off balance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2014 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of the securities and exchange commission’s regulation sk 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities fluctuations in interest rates of 10 would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale for availableforsale investments no gains or losses are recognized by us in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired availableforsale investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

longterm investments 

  

as of december 31 2014 all of our holdings in auction rate securities which have a face value of 56 million have failed to reset as a result of current market conditions should these auctions continue to fail and if the credit rating for these securities decline a 10 decline in the fair value could impact our results of operations by approximately 05 million 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our sales outside the united states are primarily transacted in us dollars accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes the functional currency of the company’s offshore operations is the local currency primarily the renminbi the new taiwan dollar and the euro in addition we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the timing of payments for transactions between the us and our foreign subsidiaries which are reported in interest and other income to date fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

  

based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2014 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control—integrated framework   2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2014 management reviewed the results of its assessment with our audit committee 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

we completed the acquisition of sensima technology sa “sensima” in july 2014 and are currently evaluating the internal control at sensima we intend to include the acquired entity in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the annual management report following the first anniversary of the acquisition other than the sensima acquisition there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures 

  

in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

  

  

 

 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

monolithic power systems inc 

san jose california 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of monolithic power systems inc and subsidiaries the company as of december 31 2014 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria  the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 based on the coso criteria 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2014 of the company and our report dated march 2 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

monolithic power systems is a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we combine advanced process technology with our highly experienced analog designers to produce highperformance power management integrated circuits ics for dc to dc converters and lighting control products our products are used extensively in computing and network communications products flat panel tvs set top boxes lighting products and a wide variety of consumer and portable electronics products and automotive and industrial markets we partner with worldclass manufacturing organizations to deliver top quality ultracompact highperformance solutions through productive costefficient channels founded in 1997 and headquartered in san jose california we have expanded our global presence with offices in taiwan china korea and japan which operate under mps international ltd we have marketing representatives in europe and singapore 

  

industry overview 

  

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or as ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for “high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics “high performance’ products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish analog and mixedsignal ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market from digital ic markets these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have however targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

products and applications 

  

we currently have two primary product families that address multiple applications within the storage and computing consumer electronics communications and industrialautomotive markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

  

direct current dc to dc products dc to dc ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers set top boxes tvs and monitors automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc products are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current high switching speed and small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices 

  

  lighting control products and acdc offline solutions lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers lcd monitors car navigation systems and lcd televisions backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode wled lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfl wled lighting control ics stepup or stepdown a dc voltage or convert from an ac line voltage supplied by the utility company also called acdc offline and provide efficient precision power and protection to a led string or to multiple led strings the ccfl ics function by converting lowvoltage direct current dc or battery voltage to highvoltage alternating current ac we believe our ccfl ics were the first to utilize a full bridge resonant topology that allows for high efficiency extended lifetimes for cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfls and lower signal interference with adjacent components the full bridge topology is now the industry standard for these products 

  

 

 

  

in addition to acdc offline solutions for lighting illumination applications we also offer acdc power conversion solutions for a diverse number of end products that plug into a wall outlet 

  

we currently target our products at the consumer electronics communications storage and computing and industrial markets with the consumer market representing the largest portion of our revenue 

  

the following is a brief summary of our product family for various applications for each of these applications we are currently shipping products or have design wins which are decisions by original equipment manufacturers oems or original design manufacturers odms to use our ics 

  

   

we derive a majority of our revenue from our dc to dc ic product family sold to the consumer electronics communications storage and computing and industrial markets in the future we will continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families such as high current high voltage small form factor switching voltage regulators as well as expand our newer product families in battery chargers voltage references and low dropout regulators our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of greater china expand our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

please refer to the table showing our revenue by product family in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations” 

  

 

 

  

customers sales and marketing 

  

we sell our products through third party distributors valueadded resellers and directly to oems odms and electronic manufacturing service ems providers our third party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors may distribute our products to end customers which include oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers 

  

as a result of consolidations in recent years among distributors sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 32 of revenue in 2013 32 in 2012 and 27 in 2011 in addition one other distributor accounted for 10 of our revenue in 2013 no other customers accounted for more than 10 of revenue in any periods presented 

  

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor shall have the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

  

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china korea and japan and have marketing representatives in europe and singapore our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems electronics containing our products 

  

because our sales are billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are not directly subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because a majority of our revenue is attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 90 of our revenue was from customers in asia 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped our manufacturing lead times are generally 4 to 12 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount take a significant writedown or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in the united states and china with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products in the area of process technology we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technology is a key strategic component to our future growth 

  

our research and development expenses totaled 497 million 488 million and 445 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

 

 

  

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 1040 patents issued and pending of which 170 have been issued in the united states our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2033 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights for a more complete description of our legal matters please read the section entitled item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or suppliers or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies who utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technology on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our integrated circuits 

  

we currently contract with three suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in china and malaysia the assembled ics are then sent for final testing primarily at our chengdu facility prior to shipping to our customers 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets and intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and have exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility for approximately 02 million following the initial fiveyear lease term we now have an option to acquire the facility in chengdu for approximately 18 million which consists of total construction costs incurred minus total rent paid by us during the lease term this option became exercisable in march 2011 we will likely exercise our purchase option and enter into a purchase agreement for this facility in the future the facility has been fully operational since 2006 and we have benefitted from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs we have expanded our product testing capabilities in our china facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations we constructed a 150000 square foot research and development facility in chengdu china which was put into operation in october 2010 

  

 

 

  

key personnel and employees 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would harm our business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2013 we employed 1105 employees located in the united states taiwan china japan korea europe and singapore 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices fairchild semiconductor international rectifier intersil corporation linear technology maxim integrated products micrel inc microchip technology microsemi corporation o2micro international on semiconductor richtek technology corporation rohm co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments 

  

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business involves risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the stock market in general often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

  

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

  

our business has been and may continue to be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions and uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy makes it more likely that our actual results will differ materially from expectations 

  

global credit and financial markets have experienced disruptions and may continue to experience disruptions in the future including diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and continued uncertainty about economic stability these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the continued or further tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges the volatility in the credit markets has severely diminished liquidity and capital availability demand for consumer electronics is a function of the health of the economies in the united states japan and around the world we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic disruption or subsequent economic recovery worldwide in the united states in our industry or in the consumer electronics market these and other economic factors have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

  

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

  

our profitability is dependent on many factors including 

  

   

   

 

 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in our operations including any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability for example due to product shortages early in 2010 several major customers in korea sought alternative suppliers which impacted our revenue particularly in 2011 and may continue to impact our revenue sources and growth in future periods 

  

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

  

in the past our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products due to various factors including increased competition loss of certain of our customer base unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and ongoing litigation we may not experience growth rates comparable to past periods which could materially and adversely affect our stock price and results of operations 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

  

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above the industry averages should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

  

we believe that the application of our products in the storage and computer consumer electronics communications and industrial markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

  

 

 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

  

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors 

  

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets 

  

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

  

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct sales or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and valueadded reseller agreements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 90 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

 

 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and financial condition 

  

we depend on a limited number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue 

  

historically we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers for example as a result of consolidations in recent years among distributors sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 32 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenue a decrease in demand for our products from any of our major customers for any reason including due to market conditions catastrophic events or otherwise could have a materially adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 

  

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which places us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements valueadded resellers and direct customers and the loss of any one of these distributors valueadded resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

  

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible as a result of consolidations in recent years among distributors sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 32 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply commitments 

  

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 

  

 

 

  

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

  

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

  

our ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

  

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  as a result this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations for example due to lack of capacity which resulted in product shortages in 2010 several major customers in korea sought alternative suppliers which impacted our revenue particularly in 2011 and may continue to impact our revenue sources and growth in future periods 

  

we currently depend on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable andor fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

  

we have a supply arrangement with certain suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice under our agreement with our suppliers we have an option to order wafers based on a committed forecast that can cover a period of one to six months if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

  

we do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as the recent global economic crisis may materially impact our assembly suppliers’ ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our thirdparty suppliers’ manufacturing capacity 

  

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops and testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities such activities are subject to a number of risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty suppliers’ capacity 

  

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

  

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from third party manufacturers in advance of selling our product we place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the timeframe that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigations or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be disposed of or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position 

  

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs and foreign tax authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities our us federal income tax returns for the years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2007 are under examination by the irs in april 2011 we received from the irs a notice of proposed adjustment or nopa relating to a costsharing agreement entered into by us and our international subsidiaries on january 1 2004 in the nopa the irs objected to our allocation of certain litigation expenses between us and our international subsidiaries and the amount of buyin payments made by our international subsidiaries to us in connection with the costsharing agreement and proposed to increase our us taxable income according to a few alternative methodologies in february 2012 we received a revised nopa from the irs revised nopa in this revised nopa the irs raised the same issues as in the nopa issued in april 2011 but under a different methodology under the revised nopa the largest potential federal income tax adjustment if the irs were to prevail on all matters in dispute is 105 million plus interest and penalties if any we responded to the irs revised nopa in may 2012 as of june 2013 the irs has responded and continues to disagree with our rebuttal we took the issue to the irs office of appeals and have an appointed date in march 2014 meanwhile we agreed to grant the irs an extension of the statute of limitations for taxable years 2005 through 2007 to december 31 2014 

  

the irs also audited the research and development credits carried forward into year 2005 and the credits generated in the years 2005 through 2007 we received a nopa from the irs in february 2011 proposing to reduce the research and development credits generated in year 2005 through 2007 and the carryforwards which would then reduce the value of such credits carried forward to subsequent tax years 

  

 

 

  

we have reviewed and responded to the above proposed adjustments we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes based on the technical merits of our tax return filing positions we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such positions will be sustained upon the resolution of our audits resulting in no significant impact on our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items such as future exercises or dispositions of stock options and restricted stock releases in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

  

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision we have hired independent tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our independent tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which would result in us having to restate our financial statements for example because of the complexity of our tax structure we have had errors in our financial statements in the calculation of our tax provision that previously resulted in restatements of our prior year financial results restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

  

if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

  

from time to time we are party to various legal proceedings if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be doubled or tripled we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products and our products and our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

  

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publiclydisclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

  

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in our incurrence of unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be impacted 

  

future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses our financial condition could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed in addition our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could divert management’s attention from focusing on our operations and adversely affect our business 

  

 

 

  

we will continue to vigorously defend and enforce our intellectual property rights around the world especially as it relates to patent litigation 

  

from time to time we are faced with having to defend our intellectual property rights throughout the world should we become engaged in such proceedings it could divert management’s attention from focusing on and implementing our business strategy further should we not be successful in any of our intellectual property enforcement actions our revenue may be affected and our business could be harmed 

  

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

the downgrade of the credit rating for us longterm sovereign debt and that of certain eurozone countries could affect global and domestic financial markets which may affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

  

although a downgrade of longterm sovereign credit ratings is not unprecedented a downgrade of the us credit rating is and the potential impact is uncertain management will continue to monitor the situation and there could be future changes in capital requirements or a rebalancing of investment portfolios in response to management’s assessment of the related risk weightings at this time however us treasuries continue to trade in active markets and the yield curve on us treasuries remains an appropriate basis for determining riskfree rates 

  

should there be a deterioration of the global and financial markets as a result of the downgraded credit rating for us longterm sovereign debt and that of certain eurozone countries our business financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities has suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days became illiquid in 2008 we experienced our first failed auction in midfebruary 2008 at december 31 2013 103 million of our auctionrate security investments have failed to reset through successful auctions and it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 35 years 

we recorded temporary and otherthantemporary impairment charges on these investments the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the quality of underlying collateral estimated time for liquidity including potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty and market conditions among others 

  

should there be further deterioration in the market for auctionrate securities the value of our portfolio may decline which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our earnings if the accounting rules for these securities change there may be an adverse impact on our earnings 

  

 

 

  

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting 

  

effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct our business and operating results could be harmed our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and could subject us to stockholder litigation for example because of the complexity of our tax structure we have had errors in our financial statements in the calculation of our tax provision that previously resulted in restatements of our prior year financial results although we believe that we have implemented appropriate internal control over financial reporting related to the computation of our income tax provision we cannot be certain that any measures we have taken or may take in the future will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and that we will avoid any material weakness in the future in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

  

our products must meet specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

  

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is generally one to two years which exposes the company to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support delays in cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

  

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

  

the price and availability of commodities eg gold copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our products incorporate commodities such as gold copper and silicon an increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

devaluation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the renminbi may adversely affect results of operations 

  

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future should the value of the renminbi continue to rise against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition because we collect payments from all customers in us dollars fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could have an adverse impact on our customers’ business which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

  

most of our manufacturing partners are located in china in addition we have established a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facility in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

 

 

  

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our testing facility in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

  

we have a testing facility in china that began operations in 2006 we face the following risks among others with respect to our testing facility in china 

  

   

   

   

if we are unable to maintain our testing facility in china at fully operational status with qualified workers appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profits 

  

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our profit margins 

  

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

  

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures must be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

  

 

 

  

our success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

  

our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development we expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and come to market with new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability if we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results also if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources we could see adverse effects on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

in addition if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 

  

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands or our business including design cycles our business could be harmed 

  

if we fail to retain key employees in sales applications finance and legal or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

  

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal staff maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal control that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

  

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

  

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships andor acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

  we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities and we may be unable to successfully integrate these companies into our operations which would adversely affect our business 

  

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities and incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles such actions by us could impact our operating results and the price of our common stock 

  

 

 

  

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings 

  

to the extent we are successful in completing strategic acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate 

  

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

  

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

 

 

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

  

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer suppliers our ic testing facility a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

 item 2 properties 

  

our primary operations are located in san jose california and chengdu china prior to may 2012 we leased a facility with approximately 55110 square feet in san jose california which served as our corporate headquarters as well as our sales and research and development center certain test procedures and manufacturing also took place in this san jose facility the landlord exercised their right to terminate the lease in april 2012 in may 2012 we moved to an owned facility located at 79 great oaks boulevard in san jose california which serves as our corporate headquarters and sales offices the property consists of a building with approximately 106262 square feet and 55 acres of land 

  

we lease a facility with approximately 56000 square feet in chengdu china which serves as our test facility and manufacturing hub in addition we constructed a 150000square foot research and development facility in chengdu china which was put into operation in october 2010 

  

we also lease sales and research and development offices in the united states japan china taiwan and korea we believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current operations 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business including litigation regarding our shareholders and our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property and claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others these proceedings often involve complex questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend we defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims 

  

o2 micro 

  

in may 2012 the united states district court for the northern district of california the “district court” issued an order finding o2 micro international ltd “o2 micro” liable for approximately 91 million in attorneys’ fees and nontaxable costs plus interest in connection with the patent litigation that we won in 2010 this award was in addition to the approximately 03 million in taxable costs that the district court had earlier ordered o2 micro to pay to us in connection with the same lawsuit in october 2012 o2 micro appealed the district court’s judgment to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit the “federal circuit” in august 2013 the federal circuit affirmed o2 micro’s liability for the full amount of the award in september 2013 o2 micro filed a petition for rehearing of that ruling but the federal circuit denied o2 micro’s petition for rehearing on october 16 2013 

  

in november 2013 we received a cash payment of 95 million from o2 micro in january 2014 o2 micro filed an appeal with the united states supreme court if the supreme court agrees to review the case and o2 micro is successful in obtaining a favorable ruling against us we may be liable to return a portion or all of the 95 million to o2 micro accordingly we recorded the 95 million as a current liability as of december 31 2013 

  

silergy 

  

in december 2011 we entered into a settlement and license agreement with silergy corp and silergy technology for infringement of our patent whereby we would receive a total of 20 million the first 12 million was paid in equal installments of 300000 in each quarter of 2012 and the remainder was paid in two equal installments in the first two quarters of 2013 no further amount was due to us as of december 31 2013 all amounts were recorded as credits to litigation expense benefit net in the consolidated statements of operations in the periods the proceeds were received

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

overview 

  

we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors our products are used extensively in storage and computing products network communications products flat panel tvs set top boxes lighting products and a wide variety of consumer and portable electronics products and automotive and industrial markets we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families as well as in new innovative product categories 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance 

  

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits “ics” this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths 

  

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult 

  

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia where the products we produce are incorporated into enduser products for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 90 and 89 of our revenue respectively was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which services the communications storage and computing consumer and industrial markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation financial instruments inventories income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectability of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in us generally recognizing revenue upon shipment when title passes to customers including distributors original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 

  

 

 

  

our revenue consists primarily of sales of assembled and tested finished goods we also sell die in wafer form to our customers and valueadded resellers and we receive royalty revenue from third parties and valueadded resellers 

  

for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 91 of our distributor sales including sales to our valueadded resellers were made through distribution arrangements with third parties these arrangements do not include any special payment terms our normal payment terms are 3045 days for our distributors price protection or exchange rights returns are limited to our standard product warranty certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases 

  

for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 9 of our distributor sales were made through small distributors primarily based on purchase orders these distributors typically have no stock rotation rights 

  

we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per distributor basis where available and information related to products in the distribution channel this reserve is recorded at the time of sale historically these returns were not material to our consolidated financial statements in the future if we are unable to estimate our stock rotation returns accurately we may have to recognize revenue when the distributors sell such inventory to end customers 

  

we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the distributors for the following reasons 

  

   

if we enter into arrangements that have rights of return that are not estimable we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributors have sold our products to end customers two of our us distributors have distribution agreements where revenue is recognized upon sale by these distributors to their end customers because these distributors have certain rights of return which management believes are not estimable the deferred revenue balance from these two distributors as of december 31 2013 and 2012 was 17 million and 16 million respectively the deferred costs as of december 31 2013 and 2012 were 02 million 

  

we generally provide a one to twoyear warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under this warranty we will repair the goods provide replacements at no charge or under certain circumstances provide a refund to the customer for defective products estimated warranty returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 

  

inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required conversely if market conditions are more favorable inventory may be sold that was previously reserved 

  

accounting for income taxes asc 74010  income taxes – overall  prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure in accordance with asc 74010 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure 

  

 

 

  

as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had a valuation allowance of 167 million and 125 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets in the us will not be realized should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

  

as a result of the cost sharing arrangements with our international subsidiaries cost share arrangements relatively small changes in costs that are not subject to sharing under the cost share arrangements can significantly impact the overall profitability of the us entity because of the us entity’s inconsistent earnings history and uncertainty of future earnings we have determined that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax benefits will not be realized 

  

we incurred significant stockbased compensation expense which related to employee stock purchase plans for which no corresponding tax benefit will be recognized unless a disqualifying disposition occurs disqualifying dispositions result in a reduction of income tax expense in the period when the disqualifying disposition occurs tax benefits related to realized tax deductions in excess of previously expensed stock compensation are recorded as an addition to paidincapital 

  

contingencies  we are a party to actions and proceedings incidental to our business in the ordinary course of business including litigation regarding our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property and claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities using asc 4502025 contingencies – loss contingencies – recognition to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with asc 45020252 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations which may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations 

  

stockbased compensation  we account for stockbased compensation under the provisions of asc 7181030 compensation – stock compensation – overall – initial measurement this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award   we use the blackscholes model to estimate the fair value of our options and employee stock purchase plan the fair value of our timebased and performancebased restricted stock units is based on the grant date share price the fair value of our marketbased restricted stock units is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model 

  

we recognize compensation expense equal to the grantdate fair value for all sharebased payment awards that are expected to vest this expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the entire awards unless the awards are subject to performance or market conditions in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche for our performancebased awards we recognize compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance criteria specified in the plan will be achieved for our marketbased awards compensation expense is not reversed if the market condition is not satisfied the amount of stockbased compensation that we recognize is also based on an expected forfeiture rate if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stockbased compensation expense and the actual forfeitures which become known over time we may change the forfeiture rate which could have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

  

 

 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income the standard requires entities to have more detailed reporting of comprehensive income specifically the standard allows an entity to present components of net income and components of other comprehensive income in one continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the guidance became effective in the first quarter of 2013 and applied retrospectively the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income this asu adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income the asu was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after december 15 2012 and must be applied prospectively we adopted this standard on january 1 2013 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201311 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists  the standard gives guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists with the purpose of reducing diversity in practice the standard requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions the guidance will become effective in the first quarter of 2014 and should be applied prospectively early adoption is permitted we do not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

results of operations

interest and other income net 

  

for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 interest and other income net was 92000 611000 and 309000 respectively interest and other income net decreased from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange losses and lower interest income in 2013 compared to 2012 interest and other income net increased from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange losses partially offset by lower interest income in 2012 compared to 2011 

  

income tax provision 

  

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2013 was 11 million or 46 of our income before income taxes this differs from the federal statutory rate primarily because our foreign income was taxed at lower rates and because of the benefit that we realized as a result of stock options exercised and restricted stock units released and changes in our valuation allowance during the year 

  

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2012 was 21 million or 119 of our income before income taxes this differs from the federal statutory rate primarily because our foreign income was taxed at lower rates the income tax provision for year ended december 31 2011 was 04 million or 31 of our income before income taxes this differs from the federal statutory rate primarily because our foreign income was taxed at lower rates

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  

as of december 31 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1012 million and shortterm investments of 1251 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of 751 million and shortterm investments of 855 million as of december 31 2012 the increase of 261 million in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities a cash payment received in connection with the o2 micro litigation and proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan this increase was partially offset by repurchases of our common stock property and equipment purchases and investment in shortterm securities as of december 31 2013 582 million of cash and cash equivalents and 170 million of shortterm investments were held by our international subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds however our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

  

 

 

  

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable inventories deferred income taxes and prepaid expenses and other current assets reduced by accounts payable accrued and other current liabilities deferred revenue and customer prepayments 

  

as of december 31 2013 we had working capital of 2536 million compared with working capital of 1908 million as of december 31 2012 the 628 million increase in working capital was due to a 778 million increase in current assets net of a 150 million increase in current liabilities the increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable and inventories the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities which included a cash payment received from the o2 micro litigation   

  

summary of cash flows 

  

the table below summarizes the cash and cash equivalents provided by used in in our operating investing and financing activities 

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2013 net cash provided by operating activities was 607 million primarily due to cash contributed from our operating results during the year and a cash payment of 95 million received in connection with the o2 micro litigation recorded as a liability as of december 31 2013 these increases were partially offset by increases in both inventories and accounts receivable the increase in accounts receivable resulted in large measure from an increase in shipments the increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in strategic wafer and die bank inventories as well as finished goods to meet anticipated future demand net cash provided by operating activities was 249 million for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily reflecting cash contributed from our operating results partially offset by 278 million increase in working capital requirements for the year ended december 31 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was 437 million primarily reflecting cash generated from our operating results 

      

for the year ended december 31 2013 net cash used in investing activities was 543 million primarily reflecting net purchases of shortterm investments and purchases of property and equipment partially offset by proceeds from the redemption of auctionrate securities for the year ended december 31 2012 net cash used in investing activities was 268 million related to our investment in equipment building improvements at our new headquarters located in san jose california and net purchases of shortterm investments partially offset by proceeds from the redemption of auctionrate securities for the year ended december 31 2011 net cash provided by investing activities was 362 million primarily from net proceeds from the sales of shortterm investments and the redemption of auctionrate securities partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 

  

we use professional investment management firms to manage the majority of our invested cash our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in us government securities and auctionrate securities the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market securities for working capital purposes 

  

our investment portfolio as of december 31 2013 included 99 million in governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities net of impairment charges of 390000 of which 360000 was temporary and 30000 was recorded as otherthantemporary this compares to an investment balance as of december 31 2012 of 118 million in governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities net of impairment charges of 520000 of which 490000 was temporary and 30000 was recorded as otherthantemporary for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 we redeemed 20 million and 21 million of auctionrate securities at par 

  

for the year ended december 31 2013 net cash provided by financing activities was 189 million primarily reflecting 400 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan partially offset by 206 million used in the repurchases of our common stock net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2012 was 196 million primarily reflecting the 357 million cash dividend paid to common stockholders on december 28 2012 partially offset by 152 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 320 million primarily reflecting 385 million of stock repurchases which was partially offset by 65 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan 

  

 

 

  

in july 2013 the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes us to repurchase up to 100 million in the aggregate of our common stock through june 30 2015 all shares are retired upon repurchase from the inception of the program through december 31 2013 we repurchased a total of 663802 shares for 206 million at an average price of 3106 per share as of december 31 2013 794 million remained available for future repurchases under the program 

  

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and shortterm investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding our operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

in the future in order to strengthen our financial position in the event of unforeseen circumstances or in the event we need to fund our growth in future financial periods we may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities issuing debt or convertible debt securities incurring indebtedness secured by our assets or selling certain product lines andor portions of our business there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

  from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines technologies businesses and companies and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities debt andor cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisition through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2013 in thousands 

 

  

our outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer purchases from our foundries and assembly services as of december 31 2013 the outstanding balance was 124 million compared with 155 million as of december 31 2012 

 

because of the uncertainty as to the timing of payments related to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded estimated obligations of 55 million from the table above in addition because of the uncertainty as to the timing of distributions related to our liabilities for the employee deferred compensation plan we have excluded estimated obligations of 06 million from the table above 

  

off balance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2013 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of the securities and exchange commission’s regulation sk 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities fluctuations in interest rates of 10 would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale for availableforsale investments no gains or losses are recognized by us in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired availableforsale investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

 

 

  

longterm investments 

  

as of december 31 2013 all of our holdings in auction rate securities which have a face value of 103 million have failed to reset as a result of current market conditions should these auctions continue to fail and if the credit rating for these securities decline a 10 decline in the fair value could impact our results of operations by approximately 10 million 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes the functional currency of the company’s offshore operations is the local currency primarily the chinese yuan and the new taiwan dollar to date fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations

based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2013 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control—integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2013 management reviewed the results of its assessment with our audit committee 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2013 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

  

 

 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

monolithic power systems inc 

san jose california 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of monolithic power systems inc and subsidiaries the company as of december 31 2013 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria  the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 based on the coso criteria 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2013 of the company and our report dated march 10 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

monolithic power systems is a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we combine advanced process technology with our highly experienced analog designers to produce highperformance power management integrated circuits ics for dc to dc converters and lighting control products our products are used extensively in computing and network communications products flat panel tvs set top boxes and a wide variety of consumer and portable electronics products automotive and industrial markets we partner with worldclass manufacturing organizations to deliver top quality ultracompact highperformance solutions through productive costefficient channels founded in 1997 and headquartered in san jose california we have expanded our global presence with offices in taiwan china korea and japan which operate under mps international ltd we have marketing representatives in europe and singapore 

  

industry overview 

  

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or as ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for ‘high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics ‘high performance’ products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish analog and mixedsignal ic markets from digital ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have however targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

products and applications 

  

we currently have two primary product families that address multiple applications within the computing consumer electronics communications and industrialautomotive markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

  

direct current dc to dc converters dc to dc converter ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers set top boxes tvs and monitors automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc converters are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current high switching speed and small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices 

 

  

  

  

lighting control products and acdc offline solutions lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers lcd monitors car navigation systems and lcd televisions backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode “wled” lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfl wled lighting control ics stepup or stepdown a dc voltage or convert from an ac line voltage supplied by the utility company also called acdc offline and provide efficient precision power and protection to a led string or to multiple led strings the ccfl ics function by converting lowvoltage direct current dc or battery voltage to highvoltage alternating current ac we believe our ccfl ics were the first to utilize a full bridge resonant topology that allows for high efficiency extended lifetimes for cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfls and lower signal interference with adjacent components the full bridge topology is now the industry standard for these products 

in addition to acdc offline solutions for lighting illumination applications mps also offers acdc power conversion solutions for a diverse number of end products that plug into a wall outlet 

  

we currently target our products at the consumer electronics communications and computing markets with the consumer market representing the largest portion of our revenue 

  

the following is a brief summary of our product family for various applications for each of these applications we are currently shipping products or have design wins which are decisions by original equipment manufacturers or oems or original design manufacturers or odms to use our ics 

  

 

  

 

 

we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter ic product family to the consumer electronics communications computing and industrial markets in the future we will continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families such as high current high voltage small form factor switching voltage regulators as well as expand our newer product families in battery chargers voltage references and low dropout regulators our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of greater china expand our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

please refer to the table showing our revenue by product family in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations” 

  

customers sales and marketing 

  

we sell our products through third party distributors valueadded resellers and directly to oems odms and electronic manufacturing service ems providers our third party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors may distribute our products to end customers which include oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers   

  

as a result of consolidations in recent years among distributors sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 32 of revenues in 2012 27 of revenues in 2011 and 21 of revenue in 2010 no other customers accounted for more than 10 of revenues in any periods presented

 

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor shall have the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products these agreements may be terminated by either us or the distributor generally up to three months’ notice these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

  

 

 

  

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china korea and japan and have marketing representatives in europe and singapore our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems electronics containing our products 

  

because our sales are billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are not directly subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because 89 of our revenue in 2012 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped our manufacturing lead times are generally 4 to 12 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in the united states and china with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products 

please refer to the discussion of the amount spent on research and development during each of the last three fiscal years in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations – research and development” in the area of process technology we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technology is a key strategic component to our future growth 

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

 

 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of january 22 2013 we had approximately 893 patents issued and pending of which 133 have been issued in the united states our us issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2031 and our other issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2032 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes in april 2008 we entered into a patent license agreement with another integrated circuit company which is a valueadded reseller pursuant to which we have granted this company a license with certain limited sublicense rights under certain of our patents to make use and sell certain of this company’s own integrated circuit products for a period of two years with an automatic renewal for successive one year periods unless either party terminates and for which this company is obligated to pay us royalties based on sales of those products in october 2012 we renewed this patent license agreement with same terms and conditions which will remain in effect until terminated by either party with prior written notice we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights for a more complete description of our legal matters please read the section entitled item 3 legal proceedings and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and a supplier in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or supplier or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies who utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technology on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our integrated circuits 

  

we currently contract with three suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in china and malaysia the assembled ics are then sent for final testing primarily at our chengdu facility prior to shipping to our customers 

we do not use conflict minerals as defined in section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act that originated in the democratic republic of the congo in the manufacturing of our products 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and have exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility for approximately 02 million following the fiveyear lease term we now have an option to acquire the facility in chengdu for approximately 18 million which consists of total construction costs incurred minus total rent paid by us during the lease term this option became exercisable in march 2011 we will likely exercise our purchase option and enter into a purchase agreement for this facility in the future the facility has been fully operational since 2006 and we have benefitted from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs furthermore we are continuing to expand our product testing capabilities in our china facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations we constructed a 150000 square foot research and development facility in chengdu china which was put into operation in october 2010 

  

 

 

  

key personnel and employees 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would harm our business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2012 we employed 993 employees located in the united states taiwan china japan korea europe and singapore 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices fairchild semiconductor international international rectifier intersil corporation linear technology maxim integrated products micrel inc microchip technology microsemi corporation o2micro international on semiconductor richtek technology corporation rohm co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv texas instruments incorporated and volterra 

  

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive with respect to these factors particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business involves risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements 

  

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

 

in addition the stock market in general often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

  

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

our business has been and may continue to be significantly impacted by the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy makes it more likely that our actual results will differ materially from expectations 

global credit and financial markets have experienced disruptions and may continue to experience disruptions in the future including diminished liquidity and credit availability declines in consumer confidence declines in economic growth increases in unemployment rates and continued uncertainty about economic stability these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the continued or further tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us in addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges the volatility in the credit markets has severely diminished liquidity and capital availability demand for consumer electronics is a function of the health of the economies in the united states japan and around the world as a result of the recent global recession experienced by the us and other economies around the world as well as the european sovereign debt crisis the overall demand for electronics has been and may continue to be adversely affected we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic disruption or subsequent economic recovery worldwide in the united states in our industry or in the consumer electronics market these and other economic factors have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results 

  

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

  

our profitability is dependent on many factors including 

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in our operations including any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability 

  

for example due to product shortages early in 2010 several major customers in korea sought alternative suppliers which impacted our revenue particularly in 2011 and may continue to impact our revenue in future periods if we are unable to find alternative sources of revenue to offset this lost revenue our profitability may be impacted which could materially and adversely affect our stock price and results of operations 

  

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

  

in the past our revenues increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products due to various factors including increased competition loss of certain of our customer install base unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and ongoing litigation we may not experience growth rates comparable to past periods which could materially and adversely affect our stock price and results of operations 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

  

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above the industry averages during the year ended december 31 2011 our gross margin decreased materially as compared to the same period in 2010 should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our financial condition could be materially adversely affected   

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times in particular since 2008 has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

  

we believe that the application of our products in the computer consumer electronics communications and industrial markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

  

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors 

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets 

  

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

 

 

  

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

  

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and valueadded reseller agreements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 89 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographical concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and financial condition 

  

we depend on a limited number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues 

historically we have generated most of our revenues from a limited number of customers for example as a result of consolidations in recent years among distributors sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 32 of revenue in 2012 27 of revenue in 2011 and 21 of revenue in 2010 we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenues a decrease in demand for our products from any of our major customers for any reason including due to market conditions catastrophic events or otherwise could have a materially adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 

  

 

 

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which places us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements valueadded resellers and direct customers and the loss of any one of these distributors valueadded resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

  

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible as a result of consolidations in recent years among distributors sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 32 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply contracts 

  

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 

  

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

  

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

  

 

 

our ability to increase product sales and revenues may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

  

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  as a result this lack of capacity has at times such as in 2010 constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

  

for example due to lack of capacity which resulted in product shortages in 2010 several major customers in korea sought alternative suppliers which impacted our revenue in 2011 and 2012 and may continue to impact our revenue in future periods if we are faced with capacity issues similar to what we experienced in 2010 our product sales and revenue may be further impacted which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we currently depend on three thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable andor fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

we have a supply arrangement with three suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice under our agreement with our suppliers we have an option to order wafers based on a committed forecast that can cover a period of one to six months if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

  

all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors we do not have any longterm agreements with these subcontractors as a result we may not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as the recent global economic crisis may materially impact our assembly supplier’s ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our thirdparty supplier’s manufacturing capacity 

  

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops or testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities such activities are subject to a number of risks including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty supplier’s capacity 

  

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

  

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from a third party manufacturer in advance of selling our product we place orders with our manufacturer based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturer in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the time frame that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigations or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be disposed of or would result in a decrease in our revenues in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position 

  

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities our us federal income tax returns for the years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2007 are under examination by the irs in april 2011 we received from the irs a notice of proposed adjustment or “nopa” relating to a costsharing agreement entered into by the company and its international subsidiaries on january 1 2004 in the nopa the irs objected to the company’s allocation of certain litigation expenses between the company and our international subsidiaries and the amount of “buyin payments” made by our international subsidiaries to the company in connection with the costsharing agreement and proposed to increase our us taxable income according to a few alternative methodologies the methodology resulting in the largest potential adjustment if the irs were to prevail on all matters in dispute would result in potential federal and state income tax liabilities of up to 370 million plus interest and penalties if any we believe that the irss position in the nopa is incorrect and that our tax returns for those years were correct as filed we are contesting these proposed adjustments vigorously in february 2012 we received a revised nopa from the irs revised nopa in this revised nopa the irs raised the same issues as in the nopa issued in april 2011 but under a different methodology under the revised nopa the largest potential federal income tax adjustment if the irs were to prevail on all matters in dispute has decreased to 105 million plus interest and penalties if any we responded to the irs revised nopa in may 2012 but have not yet received a response from the irs 

  

 

 

 

the irs also audited the research and development credits carried forward into year 2005 and the credits generated in the years 2005 through 2007 we received a nopa from the irs in february 2011 proposing to reduce the research and development credits generated in year 2005 through 2007 and the carryforwards which would then reduce the value of such credits carried forward to subsequent tax years 

 

we have reviewed and responded to the above proposed adjustments we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes as of december 31 2012 based on the technical merits of our tax return filing positions we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the benefit of such positions will be sustained upon the resolution of our audits resulting in no significant impact on our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows 

  

the french subsidiary of the company is currently under audit for taxable years 2009 and 2010 the company is in the process of responding to the questions raised by the tax authority we do not believe the resolution of the audits will result in a significant impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows aside from us and france there are no other income tax audits in process in any other material jurisdiction 

 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items such as future exercises or dispositions of stock options and restricted stock releases in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

  

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision we have hired independent tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our independent tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which would result in us having to restate our financial statements for example because of the complexity of our tax structure we have had errors in our financial statements in the calculation of our tax provision that previously resulted in restatements of our prior year financial results restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock   

  

if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our competitors we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

from time to time we are party to various legal proceedings if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be doubled or tripled we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products or our products or our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

  

 

 

  

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publiclydisclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

  

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in our incurrence of unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be impacted 

  

future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses our financial condition could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed in addition our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could distract management’s focus on our operations and adversely affect our business 

we will continue to vigorously defend and enforce our intellectual property rights around the world especially as it relates to patent litigation 

from time to time we are faced with having to defend our intellectual property rights throughout the world should we become engaged in such proceedings it could divert management’s attention from focusing on and implementing our business strategy further should we not be successful in any of our intellectual property enforcement actions our revenue may be affected and our business could be harmed 

  

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

 

 

  

the downgrade of the credit rating for us longterm sovereign debt and that of certain eurozone countries could affect global and domestic financial markets which may affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

  

although a downgrade of longterm sovereign credit ratings is not unprecedented a downgrade of the us credit rating is and the potential impact is uncertain management will continue to monitor the situation and there could be future changes in capital requirements or a rebalancing of investment portfolios in response to management’s assessment of the related risk weightings at this time however us treasuries continue to trade in active markets and the yield curve on us treasuries remains an appropriate basis for determining riskfree rates 

  

should there be a deterioration of the global and financial markets as a result of the downgraded credit rating for us longterm sovereign debt and that of certain eurozone countries our business financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities has suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days became illiquid in 2008 we experienced our first failed auction in midfebruary 2008 at december 31 2012 the company’s investment portfolio included 118 million net of impairment charges of 05 million in governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities as of that date 123 million the face value of our auctionrate security investments have failed to reset through successful auctions and it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 35 years 

  

based on certain assumptions described in note 2 “fair value measurements” to our consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k we recorded temporary and otherthantemporary impairment charges on these investments the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the quality of underlying collateral estimated time for liquidity including potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty and market conditions among others 

  

should there be further deterioration in the market for auctionrate securities the value of our portfolio may decline which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our earnings if the accounting rules for these securities change there may be an adverse impact on our earnings it is unlikely that we will be able to liquidate our auctionrate securities in the short term 

  

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting 

effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct our business and operating results could be harmed our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and could subject us to stockholder litigation for example because of the complexity of our tax structure we have had errors in our financial statements in the calculation of our tax provision that previously resulted in restatements of our prior year financial results although we believe that we have implemented appropriate internal control over financial reporting related to the computation of our income tax provision we cannot be certain that any measures we have taken or may take in the future will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and that we will avoid any material weakness in the future in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

  

 

 

our products must meet exacting specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

  

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is one year which exposes the company to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support delays in cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

  

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

  

the price and availability of commodities eg gold platinum copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our products incorporate commodities such as gold platinum copper and silicon an increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and other like commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

devaluation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the renminbi may adversely affect results of operations 

  

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future should the value of the renminbi continue to rise against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition because we collect payments from all customers in us dollars fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could have an adverse impact on our customers’ business which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

  

most of our manufacturing partners are located in china in addition we have established a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facility in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

 

 

  

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our testing facility in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

  

we have a testing facility in china that began operations in 2006 in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we face the following risks among others with respect to our testing facility in china 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

if we are unable to maintain our testing facility in china at fully operational status with qualified workers appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future which could harm our revenues and gross profits 

  

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our margins   

  

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

  

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures must be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

  

 

 

our success depends on our investment of significant amount of resources in research and development we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 

our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development our research and development expenses as a percent of our total revenue were 228 and 227 for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively we expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and come to market with new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability if we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results also if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources we could see adverse effects on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition if new competitors technological advances by existing competitors our entry into new markets or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 

  

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands or our business including design cycles our business could be harmed 

if we fail to retain key employees in sales applications finance and legal or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

  

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal staff maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal controls that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

  

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

  

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships andor acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

 

 

  

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities and we may be unable to successfully integrate these companies into our operations which would adversely affect our business 

  

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities andor incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles such actions by us could impact our operating results andor the price of our common stock 

  

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisition for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings 

  

to the extent we are successful in completing strategic acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our competitors to include but not be limited to fairchild semiconductor intersil linear maxim integrated products micrel microsemi national semiconductor o2micro richtek rohm semtech stmicroelectronic texas instruments and volterra we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market 

  

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

  

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

because of their significant stock ownership our officers and directors will be able to exert significant influence over our future direction 

  

executive officers directors and affiliated entities beneficially owned in aggregate approximately 17 of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2012 these stockholders if acting together would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions   

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

  

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer suppliers our ic testing facility a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

our facilities in chengdu china are located in a seismically active area as evidenced by the may 2008 earthquake that was centered in the sichuan province of china although there was no damage to our facilities as a result of that earthquake should there be additional earthquakes in the area we may incur losses and our business financial condition andor operating results may suffer 

  

 

 

  

we have a sales facility in japan which is located in a seismically active area as evidenced by the march 2011 earthquake that was centered off the coast of japan’s miyagi prefecture while there was no damage to our facilities as a result of the earthquake our customers may have experienced disruptions in their supply chains that may impact our revenue in future quarters additional earthquakes in the region may have a more significant impact longer term which could affect our results of operations and financial conditions

we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we currently offer products that serve multiple markets including consumer electronics communications computing which includes storage and industrial markets we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as in new product categories 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits “ics” this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths 

  

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters to achieve revenue and volume production is usually achieved several months after we receive an initial customer order for a new product typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult 

  

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements or direct sales to customers in asia where the components we produce are incorporated into an enduser product for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 89 and 90 respectively of our revenue was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which services the consumer electronics communications computing which includes storage and industrial markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

 

 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation longterm investments shortterm investments inventories income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” – accounting standards codification “asc” 60510s25 revenue recognition – overall – recognition  asc 60510s25 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed or determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectability of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in our generally recognizing revenue upon shipment when title passes to customers should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 

  

approximately 91 of our distributor sales including sales to our valueadded resellers for the year ended december 31 2012 were made through distribution arrangements with third parties these arrangements do not include any special payment terms our normal payment terms are 3045 days for our distributors price protection or exchange rights returns are limited to our standard product warranty certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases 

  

approximately 9 of our distributor sales for the year ended december 31 2012 were made through small distributors primarily based on purchase orders these distributors also have limited or no stock rotation rights 

our revenue consists primarily of sales of assembled and tested finished goods we also sell die in wafer form to our customers and valueadded resellers and we receive royalty revenue from third parties and valueadded resellers 

we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per distributor basis where available and information related to products in the distribution channel this reserve is recorded at the time of sale historically these returns were not material to our consolidated financial statements in the future if we are unable to estimate our stock rotation returns accurately we may not be able to recognize revenue from sales to our distributors based on when we sell inventory to our distributors instead we may have to recognize revenue when the distributor sells through such inventory to an endcustomer 

  

 

 

  

we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the distributor for the following reasons based on asc 60515251 revenue recognition – products – recognition – sales of products when right of return exists  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we enter into arrangements that have rights of return that are not estimable we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributor has sold our products to an end customer 

the terms in a majority of our distribution agreements include the nonexclusive right to promote develop a market for and sell our products in certain regions of the world and the ability to terminate the distribution agreement by either party with up to three months’ notice we provide a one year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under this warranty we will repair the goods provide replacements at no charge or under certain circumstances provide a refund to the customer for defective products estimated warranty returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 

  

two of our us distributors have distribution agreements where revenue is recognized upon sale by these distributors to their end customers because these distributors have certain rights of return which management believes are not estimable the deferred income balance from these two distributors as of december 31 2012 and 2011 was 14 million and 09 million respectively 

  

inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required conversely if market conditions are more favorable inventory may be sold that was previously reserved 

  

accounting for income taxes asc 74010 income taxes – overall prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure in accordance with asc 74010 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure 

  

  

  

as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had a valuation allowance of 125 million and 146 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets in the united states will not be realized should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

as a result of the cost sharing arrangements with the company’s international subsidiaries cost share arrangements relatively small changes in costs that are not subject to sharing under the cost share arrangements can significantly impact the overall profitability of the us entity because of the us entity’s inconsistent earnings history and uncertainty of future earnings the company has determined that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax benefits will not be realized 

in november 2012 california taxpayers voted in favor of mandating the use of a single sales factor for california state apportionment effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2012 as a result of this law change that happened our california deferred tax assets were revalued down as we have a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets this revaluation of our california deferred tax assets did not impact income tax expense 

the company incurred significant stockbased compensation expense some of which related to incentive stock options for which no corresponding tax benefit will be recognized unless a disqualifying disposition occurs disqualifying dispositions result in a reduction of income tax expense in the period when the disqualifying disposition occurs tax benefits related to realized tax deductions in excess of previously expensed stock compensation are recorded as an addition to paidincapital 

  

contingencies  we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to actions and proceedings incident to our business in the ordinary course of business including litigation regarding our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property and claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities using asc 45020252 contingencies – loss contingencies  recognition to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with asc 45020252 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations which may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations 

accounting for stockbased compensation we account for stockbased compensation under the provisions of asc 7181030 compensation – stock compensation – overall – initial measurement  this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award we currently use the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of our sharebased payments the blackscholes optionpricing model is based on a number of assumptions including historical volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends the fair value for timebased stock awards and stock awards that are contingent upon the achievement of financial performance metrics is based on the grant date share price 

 

  

  

we recognize compensation expense equal to the grantdate fair value for all sharebased payment awards that are expected to vest this expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the entire award unless the awards are subject to market or performance conditions in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche we recognize compensation expense for our performance share units when it becomes probable that the performance criteria specified in the plan will be achieved the amount of stockbased compensation that the company recognizes is also based on an expected forfeiture rate if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stockbased compensation costs and the actual forfeitures which become known over time we may change the forfeiture rate which could have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

fair value of financial instruments asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures – overall defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the three categories as follows 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

asc 820103551 fair value measurement and disclosure – overall – subsequent measurement – determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures – overall  when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 

  

our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates fair market value shortterm and longterm investments are stated at their fair market value 

  

the face value of our holdings in auction rate securities is 123 million all of which is classified as longterm availableforsale investments 

  

investments in availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized through shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet and in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income we record an impairment charge to earnings when an availableforsale investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary 

  

we followed the guidelines of asc 320 in determining if the impairment is temporary or otherthantemporary “otti” during the year ended december 31 2012 we were able to redeem a security at face value for which an otti of 40000 had previously been recorded for and therefore recognized a gain of 40000 in interest income and other net in our consolidated statement of operations 

  

based on certain assumptions described in note 2 “fair value measurements” to our consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k we recorded impairment charges on our holdings in auctionrate securities the valuation of these securities is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others 

 

  

  

  

recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements 

  

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income this asu adds new disclosure requirement for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after december 15 2012 and must be applied prospectively the company is evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

  

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201105 relating to comprehensive income topic 220 – presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 which requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after december 15 2011 and must be applied retrospectively the company adopted this standard effective january 1 2012 

  

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201104 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards topic 820 – fair value measurement asu 201104 to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards asu 201104 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after december 15 2011 and should be applied prospectively the company adopted this standard effective january 1 2012 

  

results of operations 

  

the table below shows the consolidated statements of operations amounts in thousands and shows each as a percentage of revenue 

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

the following table shows our revenue by product family amounts in thousands except percentages 

 

 

 

 

 

revenue 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 was 2138 million an increase of 173 million or 88 from 1965 million for the year ended december 31 2011 this increase was primarily due to increased demand for our dc to dc converters revenue from our dc to dc converters was 1887 million an increase of 187 million or 110 over the same period in 2011 primarily due to increased demand for our dc to dc converters minimonster and cls products sales of our lighting control products for the year ended december 31 2012 were down by 53 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to reductions in demand for our ccfl and wled products 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 was 1965 million a decrease of 223 million or 102 from 2188 million for the year ended december 31 2010 for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in revenue from the same period last year was largely attributable to having lost certain dc to dc converters product customers in korea as a lack of production capacity resulted in product shortages during 2010 audio sales which are reported in dc to dc converters beginning in 2012 were 44 million for the year ended december 31 2011 a decrease of 28 million from the same period in 2010 due to a change in product mix the sales of our lighting control products were down for the year ended december 31 2011 from the similar period in 2010 because of a reduction in the demand for our ccfl products which was partially offset by increased sales of our wled products 

  

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  

 

 

cost of revenue consists primarily of costs incurred to manufacture assemble and test our products as well as other overhead costs relating to the aforementioned costs including stockbased compensation expense gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin was 529 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 517 for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in gross profit margin yearoveryear was primarily due to lower inventory reserves and improved product mix compared to the same period in 2011 

gross margin was 517 for the year ended december 31 2011 and 555 for the year ended december 31 2010 for the year ended december 31 2011 gross margin declined between years as a result of declining average selling prices for certain of our products unabsorbed test manufacturing costs and an increase in inventory reserves 

research and development 

research and development expenses consist of salary and benefit expenses for design and product engineers expenses related to new product development and related facility costs 

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

rd expenses were 488 million or 228 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 and 445 million or 227 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 rd expenses increased yearoveryear primarily due to an increase in cash and stockbased compensation expenses and an increase in expenses associated with increased new product development our rd headcount as of december 31 2012 was 388 employees compared to 374 employees as of december 31 2011 

  

rd expenses were 445 million or 227 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 and 444 million or 203 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 for the year ended december 31 2011 rd expenses remained flat with the same period in 2010 due to lower stockbased compensation expenses these were partially offset by an increase in cash compensation expenses and new product development expenses 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expenses include salary and benefit expenses for sales marketing and administrative personnel sales commissions travel expenses related facilities costs outside legal and accounting fees and fees associated with sarbanesoxley compliance requirements 

 

 

  

sga expenses were 500 million or 234 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 and 403 million or 205 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 sga expenses increased yearoveryear primarily due to an increase in cash and stockbased compensation expenses professional services fees and sales commission on higher revenue compared to the same period in 2011 our sga headcount as of december 31 2012 was 250 employees compared to 238 employees as of december 31 2011 

  

sga expenses were 403 million or 205 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 and 412 million or 188 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 for the year ended december 31 2011 sga expenses decreased from the same period in 2010 due to lower stockbased compensation expenses these were partially offset by an increase in cash compensation expenses 

  

litigation expense benefit net 

 

 

  

litigation benefit net was 29 million or 14 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to an expense of 34 million or 17 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 the yearoveryear decrease in litigation expense was primarily due to 37 million received in connection with settlements reached with linear and silergy   these payments were recorded as credits to litigation expense benefit net in the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december 31 2011 we incurred legal expenses primarily to recover attorneys’ fees from o2micro relating to our lawsuits involving o2micro which were resolved in the second quarter of 2010 compared with 2011 litigation expenses decreased as a result of us being party to fewer material legal actions 

 

  

  

litigation expenses were 34 million or 17 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 54 million or 25 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 during the year ended december 31 2011 we incurred legal expenses primarily to recover attorneys’ fees from o2micro relating to our earlier lawsuits with them which were resolved in the second quarter of 2010 during the year ended december 31 2010 we incurred legal expenses primarily for the defense of those lawsuits overall our litigation expense decreased as a result of us being party to fewer material legal actions 

for a more complete description of our current material litigation matters please see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 10 “litigation” of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

interest income and other net 

for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 interest income and other net was 06 million 03 million and 09 million respectively interest income increased from 2011 to 2012 due to higher average cash and investment balances in 2012 as compared to 2011 interest income decreased from 2010 to 2011 due to lower cash and investment balances in 2011 which resulted from stock repurchase activity and the purchase of our san jose headquarters as well as interest rate declines yearoveryear 

income tax provision 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2012 was 21 million or 119 of our income before income taxes this differs from the federal statutory rate of 34 primarily because our foreign income was taxed at lower rates and because of the benefit that we realized as a result of stock options exercised and restricted units released 

the income tax provision for year ended december 31 2011 was 04 million or 31 of our income before income taxes this differs from the federal statutory rate of 34 primarily because our foreign income was taxed at lower rates and because of the benefit that we realized as a result of stock options exercised and restricted units released 

  

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2010 was 19 million or 59 of our income before income taxes this was lower than the federal statutory rate of 34 primarily because our foreign income was taxed at lower rates and because of the benefit that we realized as a result of stock options exercised and restricted units released   

  

for additional information see note 8 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

 

 

as of december 31 2012 we had cash and cash equivalents of 751 million and shortterm investments of 855 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of 964 million and shortterm investments of 778 million as of december 31 2011 the decrease of 213 million in cash and cash equivalents in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the 357 million cash dividend paid to common stockholders on december 28 2012 investment in equipment and building improvements at our new headquarters located in san jose california and investment in shortterm securities these uses of cash were partially offset by cash generated from operating activities and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan we have financed our operations primarily with cash generated from operating activities proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan as of december 31 2012 438 million of the 751 million of cash and cash equivalents and 170 million of the 855 million of shortterm investments were held by our international subsidiaries if these funds are needed for our operations in the us we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds however our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments accounts receivable inventories deferred income taxes and prepaid expenses and other current assets reduced by accounts payable accrued and other current liabilities deferred revenue and customer prepayments 

as of december 31 2012 we had working capital of 1908 million compared with working capital of 1854 million as of december 31 2011 the 54 million increase in working capital since december 31 2011 was due to a 28 million net increase in current assets and a 26 million net decrease in current liabilities the increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in inventories shortterm investments and accounts receivable which were partially offset by a reduction in cash and cash equivalents the reduction in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the 357 million cash dividend paid to common stockholders on december 28 2012 which was partially offset by cash generated from operating activities in addition accounts receivable increased primarily reflecting an increase in shipments the decrease in current liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits which were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 

 

  

  

summary of cash flows 

the table below summarizes the cash and cash equivalents provided by used in in our operating investing and financing activities for the periods presented 

 

 

  

 

for the year ended december 31 2012 net cash provided by operating activities was 249 million primarily due to cash contributed from our operating results during the year partially offset by increases in both inventories and accounts receivable the increase in accounts receivable resulted in large measure from an increase in shipments the increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in strategic wafer and die bank inventories as well as finished goods to meet anticipated future demand net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 188 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to a 278 million increase in working capital requirements for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 partially offset by cash provided by our operating results during the year 2012 compared to 2011 for the year ended december 31 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was 437 million primarily reflecting cash generated from our operating results for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was 485 million primarily reflecting cash contributed from our operating results partially offset by an increase in inventories to support the deliveries in the first quarter of 2011 

  

for the year ended december 31 2012 net cash used in investing activities was 268 million in support of our investment in equipment building improvements at our new headquarters located in san jose california and net purchases of shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2011 net cash provided by investing activities was 362 million as proceeds from the sale of shortterm investments were used to fund our stock repurchase program and to purchase our corporate headquarters in san jose california for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash used in investing activities was 338 million reflecting the construction of and equipment purchases for our facilities in chengdu and the net purchase of shortterm investments 

  

we use professional investment management firms to manage the majority of our invested cash our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in us government securities and auctionrate securities the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market securities for working capital purposes 

  

we used the guidelines of asc 320 to determine whether the impairment was temporary or otherthan temporary during the year ended december 31 2012 we were able to redeem a security at face value for which an otti of 40000 had previously been recorded for and therefore recognized a gain of 40000 in interest income and other net in our consolidated statement of operations 

our investment portfolio as of december 31 2012 included 118 million in governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities net of impairment charges of 052 million of which 049 million was temporary and 003 million was otherthantemporary this compares to an investment balance of auctionrate securities as of december 31 2011 of 137 million net of impairment charges of 07 million of which 06 million was temporary and 01 million was otherthantemporary 

 

  

  

the underlying maturities of these auctionrate securities are up to 35 years as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the portion of the impairment classified as temporary was based on the following analysis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

based on the guidance of asc 3201035 and asc 3201050 we evaluated the potential credit loss of each of the auctionrate securities that are currently held by us based on such analysis we determined that those securities that are not 100 federal family education loan program ffelps guaranteed are potentially subject to credit risks based on the extent to which the underlying debt is collateralized and the securityspecific studentloan default rates our portfolio includes two such securities the senior parity ratio for the two securities is approximately 106 if therefore the studentloan default rate and borrowing rate increases for these issuers the remaining balance in these trusts may not be sufficient to cover the senior debt we therefore concluded that there is potential credit risk for these two securities and as such used the discounted cash flow model to determine the amount of credit loss to be recorded in valuing the potential credit loss the following parameters were used 20 year expected term cash flows based on the 90day tbill rates for 20 year forwards and a risk premium of 59 the amount of interest that we were receiving on these securities when the market was last active during the year ended december 31 2009 the potential credit loss associated with these securities was 70000 which we deemed otherthantemporary and recorded in other expense in its consolidated statement of operations during 2009 there have been no such losses since during the year ended december 31 2012 we were able to redeem one of these two securities at par and therefore recognized a gain of 40000 in interest income and other net in our consolidated statement of operations 

  

unless a rights offering or other similar offer is made to redeem at par and accepted by us we intend to hold the balance of these investments through successful auctions at par which we believe could take approximately 20 years 

  

determining the fair value of the auctionrate securities requires significant management judgment regarding projected future cash flows which will depend on many factors including the quality of the underlying collateral estimated time for liquidity including potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty and market conditions among others to determine the fair value of the auctionrate securities at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we used a discounted cash flow model for which there are four unobservable inputs estimated timetoliquidity discount rate credit quality of the issuer and expected interest receipts a significant increase in the timetoliquidity or the discount rate inputs or a significant decrease in the credit quality of the issuer or the expected interest receipts inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement 

the following are the values used in the discounted cash flow model 

  

 

  

  

  

 

from december 31 2011 to december 31 2012 we kept the timetoliquidity constant at 20 years we sold 21 million in auctionrate securities at par and reversed the impairment related to these securities in the amount of 02 million this reduced the overall impairment from 07 million at december 31 2011 to 05 million at december 31 2012 

  

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2012 was 196 million primarily reflecting the 357 million cash dividend paid to common stockholders on december 28 2012 partially offset by a combined 152 million of cash received from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock sold through our employee stock purchase plan net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 320 million primarily reflecting 385 million of stock repurchases which was partially offset by a combined 65 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock sold through our employee stock purchase plan net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 was 140 million primarily reflecting 315 million in common stock repurchases partially offset by a combined 162 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock sold through our employee stock purchase plan   

  

on july 27 2010 the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized mps to repurchase up to 500 million in the aggregate of its common stock between august 2 2010 and december 31 2011 in february 2011 the board of directors approved an authorization increase from 500 million to 700 million the repurchase program is now complete and the following shares have been repurchased through the open market and subsequently retired 

  

 

  

 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and shortterm investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding our operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

in the future in order to strengthen our financial position in the event of unforeseen circumstances or in the event we need to fund our growth in future financial periods we may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities issuing debt or convertible debt securities incurring indebtedness secured by our assets or selling certain product lines andor portions of our business there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

  

  

from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines technologies and businesses and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities debt andor cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisition through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 

contractual obligations 

in may 2012 we moved from our previous leased headquarters in san jose california to our current companyowned headquarters also located in san jose california 

we also lease our research and development and sales offices in the united states japan china taiwan and korea 

certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases 

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with the chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility of approximately 02 million following the fiveyear lease term we now have an option to acquire this facility in chengdu for approximately 18 million which consist of total construction cost incurred minus total rent paid by us during the lease term this option became exercisable in march 2011 and does not expire we will likely exercise our purchase option and enter into a purchase agreement for this facility in the future we constructed a 150000 square foot research and development facility in chengdu china which was put into operation in october 2010 

  

as of december 31 2012 our total outstanding purchase commitments primarily for wafers from our three foundries and assembly services were 155 million this compares to purchase commitments of 186 million as of december 31 2011 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2012 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years in thousands 

 

 

  

because of the uncertainty as to the timing of payments related to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded estimated obligations of 49 million from the table above 

off balance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2012 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of the securities and exchange commission’s regulation sk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities 

 

  

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale or trading for availableforsale investments no gains or losses are recognized by us in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired availableforsale investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 

fluctuations in interest rates of plus or minus 10 could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 01 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes in 2012 the primary functional currency of the company’s offshore operations was the local currency primarily the new taiwan dollar and the chinese yuan to date fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations however fluctuations of  10 on intercompany transactions of 503 million in such local currencies could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 50 million 

value change to longterm investments 

as of december 31 2012 all of our holdings in auction rate securities which have a face value of 123 million have failed to reset as a result of current market conditions should these auctions continue to fail and if the credit rating for these securities decline a 10 decline in the fair value could impact our results of operations by approximately 12 million

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to us including our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

 

  

  

 

based on our evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at december 31 2012 and provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15df our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

 

our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

 

a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a deficiency in design exists when a a control necessary to meet the control objective is missing or b an existing control is not properly designed so that even if the control operates as designed the control objective would not be met a deficiency in operation exists when a properly designed control does not operate as designed or when the person performing the control does not possess the necessary authority or competence to perform the control effectively a significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 in performing this assessment management used the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control— integrated framework based upon this assessment our management has concluded that as of december 31 2012 our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

 

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report included elsewhere herein on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

    

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  

while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance that their respective objectives will be met we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors and all fraud any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2012 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

  

  

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

monolithic power systems inc 

san jose california 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of monolithic power systems inc and subsidiaries the company as of december 31 2012 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 of the company and our report dated march 5 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

monolithic power systems is a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we combine advanced process technology with our highly experienced analog designers to produce highperformance power management integrated circuits ics for dc to dc converters led drivers cold cathode fluorescent lamp ccfl backlight controllers classd audio amplifiers and other linear ics our products are used extensively in computing and network communications products flat panel tvs set top boxes and a wide variety of consumer and portable electronics products we partner with worldclass manufacturing organizations to deliver top quality ultracompact highperformance solutions through productive costefficient channels founded in 1997 and headquartered in san jose california we have expanded our global presence with offices in taiwan china korea japan and europe which operate under mps international ltd 

  

industry overview 

  

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or as ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets   we focus on the market for ‘high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics ‘high performance’ products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish analog and mixedsignal ic markets from digital ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market these factors include longer product life cycles   numerous market segments technology   that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have however targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

products and applications 

  

we currently have three primary product families that address multiple applications within the computing consumer electronics communications and industrialautomotive markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

  

direct current dc to dc converters dc to dc converter ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers set top boxes tvs and monitors automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc converters are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current high switching speed and small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices 

lighting control products and acdc offline solutions   lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers lcd monitors car navigational systems and lcd televisions backlighting solutions are typically either white light emitting diode “wled” lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfl wled lighting control ics stepup or stepdown a dc voltage or convert from an ac line voltage supplied by the utility company also called acdc offline and provide efficient precision power and protection to a led string or to multiple led strings the ccfl ics function by converting lowvoltage direct current dc or battery voltage to highvoltage alternating current ac we believe our ccfl ics were the first to utilize a full bridge resonant topology that allows for high efficiency extended lifetimes for cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfls and lower signal interference with adjacent components the full bridge topology is now the industry standard for these products 

in addition to acdc offline solutions for lighting illumination applications mps also offers acdc power conversion solutions for a diverse number of end products that plug into a wall outlet 

 

  

  

  

audio amplifiers   audio amplifier ics are used to amplify sound produced by audio processors we currently offer classd audio amplifiers which are wellsuited for applications that require both a small form factor and high power efficiency such as plasma televisions lcd televisions and dvd players with today’s systems becoming smaller and utilizing larger amounts of power solution sizes and the management of heat dissipation are becoming increasingly important to the overall system design the high degree of power efficiency and small form factor provided by our classd audio amplifiers allows system vendors to significantly reduce heat dissipation eliminating the costly and sizable fans and heat sinks traditionally required by audio amplifier ics these features enable our customers to achieve their design and cost objectives without sacrificing sound quality 

 

we currently target our products at the consumer electronics communications and computing markets with the consumer market representing the largest portion of our revenue 

 

the following is a brief summary of our product family solutions for various applications for each of these applications we are currently shipping product or have design wins which are decisions by original equipment manufacturers or oems or original design manufacturers or odms to use our ics 

   

we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter ic product family to the computing consumer electronics and communications markets in the future we will continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families such as high current high voltage small form factor switching voltage regulators as well as expand our newer product families in battery chargers voltage references and low dropout regulators our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of greater china expand our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

please refer to the table showing our revenue by product family in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations” 

 

  

  

customers sales and marketing 

  

we sell our products through third party distributors valueadded resellers and directly to oems odms and electronic manufacturing service ems providers our third party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors may distribute our products to end customers which include oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers the following is a summary for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 of those customers that accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in one or more of these years 

 

 

 

 

 

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor shall have the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in several countries in asia these agreements may be terminated by either us or the distributor on up to three months’ notice these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

  

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china korea singapore and japan and have marketing representatives in europe our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems electronics containing our products 

  

because our sales are billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are not directly subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because 90 of our revenue in 2011 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped our manufacturing lead times are generally 4 to 12 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in the united states china and europe with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products 

please refer to the discussion of the amount spent on research and development during each of the last three fiscal years in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations – research and development” in the area of process technology we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technology is a key strategic component to our future growth 

 

  

  

  

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of january 9 2012 we had approximately 646 patents issued and pending of which 101 have been issued in the united states our us issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2030 and our other issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through september 2029 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes in april 2008 we entered into a patent license agreement with another integrated circuit company which is a valueadded reseller pursuant to which we have granted this company a license with certain limited sublicense rights under certain of our patents to make use and sell certain of this company’s own integrated circuit products for a period of two years  with an automatic renewal for successive one year periods unless either party terminates and for which this company is obligated to pay us royalties based on sales of those products we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights for a more complete description of our legal matters please read the section entitled item 3 legal proceedings and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and a supplier in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or supplier or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies who utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technology on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our integrated circuits 

  

we currently contract with three suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in malaysia and china the assembled ics are then sent for final testing at our chengdu facility prior to shipping to our customers 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and have exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility for approximately 02 million we also have the option which became exercisable in march 2011 to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 19 million we will likely exercise our purchase option and enter into a purchase agreement for this facility in the future the facility has been fully operational since 2006 and we have benefitted from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs furthermore we are continuing to expand our product testing capabilities in our china facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations 

 

  

  

  

key personnel and employees 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would harm our business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2011 we employed 922 employees located in the united states taiwan china japan korea europe and singapore 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices fairchild semiconductor international international rectifier intersil corporation linear technology maxim integrated products micrel inc microchip technology microsemi corporation o2micro international on semiconductor richtek technology corporation rohm co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv texas instruments incorporated and volterra 

  

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive with respect to these factors particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business involves risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements 

 

  

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

 

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the stock market in general often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

 

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

 

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

 

our profitability is dependent on many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in our operations including any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability 

 

due to product shortages early in 2010 several major customers in korea sought alternative suppliers which impacted our full year revenue in 2011 and may continue to impact our revenue in future periods if we are unable to find alternative sources of revenue to offset this source of lost revenue our profitability may be impacted which could materially and adversely affect our stock price and results of operations 

 

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

 

in the past our revenues increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products due to various factors including increased competition loss of certain of our customer install base unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and ongoing litigation we may not experience growth rates comparable to past periods which could materially and adversely affect our stock price and results of operations 

 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

 

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above the industry averages during the year ended december 31 2011 our gross margin decreased materially as compared to the same period in 2010 should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

  

  

 

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

 

we believe that the application of our products in the computer consumer electronics and communications markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

 

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors 

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets 

 

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

 

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct or indirect sales through distribution arrangements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 90 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographical concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and financial condition 

 

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the us foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which places us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements valueadded resellers and direct customers and the loss of any one of these distributors or valueadded resellers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

 

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible for the year ended december 31 2011 sales to our largest two distributors accounted for approximately 27 of our total revenue significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply contracts 

 

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 

 

  

  

 

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

 

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast specifically in the fourth quarter of 2010 demand was lower because distributors used up inventory that was shipped in the third quarter if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

our ability to increase product sales and revenues may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

 

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  as a result this lack of capacity has constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

due to lack of capacity which resulted in product shortages in early 2010 several major customers in korea sought alternative suppliers which impacted our full year revenue in 2011 and may continue to impact our revenue in future periods if we are faced with capacity issues similar to what we experienced in 2010 our product sales and revenue may be further impacted which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we currently depend on three thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable andor fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

we have a supply arrangement with three suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

 

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice under our agreement with our suppliers we have an option to order wafers based on a committed forecast that can cover a period of one to six months if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

 

all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors we do not have any longterm agreements with these subcontractors as a result we may not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as the recent global economic crisis may materially impact our assembly supplier’s ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

  

  

 

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our thirdparty supplier’s manufacturing capacity 

 

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops or testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities such activities are subject to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty supplier’s capacity 

 

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

 

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from a third party manufacturer in advance of selling our product we place orders with our manufacturer based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturer in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the time frame that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigations or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be disposed of or would result in a decrease in our revenues in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position 

 

the outcome of currently ongoing and future examinations of our income tax returns by the irs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities our us federal income tax returns for the years ended december 31 2000 through december 31 2007 are under examination by the irs in april 2011 we received from the irs a notice of proposed adjustment or “nopa” relating to a costsharing agreement entered into by the company and its international subsidiaries on january 1 2004 in the nopa the irs objected to the company’s allocation of certain litigation expenses between the company and our international subsidiaries and the amount of “buyin payments” made by our international subsidiaries to the company in connection with the costsharing agreement and proposed to increase our us taxable income according to a few alternative methodologies the methodology resulting in the largest potential adjustment if the irs were to prevail on all matters in dispute would result in potential federal and state income tax liabilities of up to 370 million plus interest and penalties if any we believe that the irss position in the nopa is incorrect and that our tax returns for those years were correct as filed we expect to contest these proposed adjustments vigorously in february 2012 we received a revised nopa from the irs revised nopa in this revised nopa the irs is raising the same issues as in the nopa issued in april 2011 but under a different methodology under the revised nopa the largest potential adjustment if the irs were to prevail on all matters in dispute has decreased to 105 million plus interest and penalties if any this is considered to be a subsequent event to our balance sheet date and we are currently reviewing the revised nopa the irs also audited the research and development credits generated in the years 2000 through 2007 and the carryforward of these credits to subsequent years we received a nopa from the irs in february 2011 proposing to reduce the research and development credits generated in years 2000 through 2007 which would also reduce the value of such credits carried forward to subsequent tax years 

we are currently reviewing these proposed adjustments we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes as of december 31 2011 based on the technical merits of our tax return filing positions we believe that it is morelikelythannot that the benefit of such positions will be sustained upon the resolution of our audits resulting in no significant impact on our consolidated financial position and the results of operations and cash flows 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

 

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision we have hired independent tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our independent tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which would result in us having to restate our financial statements for example because of the complexity of our tax structure we have had errors in our financial statements in the calculation of our tax provision that previously resulted in restatements of our prior year financial results restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

 

  

  

 

if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our competitors we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be doubled or tripled we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products or our products or our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

 

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publiclydisclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

 

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in our incurrence of unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be impacted 

 

future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses our financial condition could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed in addition our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could distract management’s focus on our operations and adversely affect our business 

we will continue to vigorously defend and enforce our intellectual property rights around the world especially as it relates to patent litigation 

from time to time we are faced with having to defend our intellectual property rights throughout the world should we become engaged in such proceedings it could divert management’s attention from focusing on and implementing our business strategy further should we not be successful in any of our intellectual property enforcement actions our revenue may be affected and our business could be harmed 

 

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

 

  

  

 

sp’s downgraded credit rating for us longterm sovereign debt and that of certain eurozone countries could affect global and domestic financial markets which may affect our business financial condition and liquidity 

 

sp’s downgraded credit rating for us longterm sovereign debt and that of certain eurozone countries could materially affect global and domestic financial markets and economic conditions although a downgrade of longterm sovereign credit ratings is not unprecedented a downgrade of the us credit rating is and the potential impact is uncertain management will continue to monitor the situation and there could be future changes in capital requirements or a rebalancing of investment portfolios in response to management’s assessment of the related risk weightings at this time however us treasuries continue to trade in active markets and the yield curve on us treasuries remains an appropriate basis for determining riskfree rates 

 

should there be a deterioration of the global and financial markets as a result of the downgraded credit rating for us longterm sovereign debt our business financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 

 

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities has suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

 

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days became illiquid in 2008 at december 31 2011 the company’s investment portfolio included 137 million net of impairment charges of 07 million in governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities as of that date 144 million the face value of our auctionrate security investments have failed to reset through successful auctions and it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 36 years 

 

based on certain assumptions described in note 2 “fair value measurements” to our consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k we recorded temporary and otherthantemporary impairment charges on these investments the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others we experienced our first failed auction in midfebruary 2008 

 

should there be further deterioration in the market for auctionrate securities the value of our portfolio may decline which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our earnings if the accounting rules for these securities change  there may be an adverse impact on our earnings it is unlikely that we will be able to liquidate our auctionrate securities in the short term 

 

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting 

effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct our business and operating results could be harmed our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock and could subject us to stockholder litigation for example because of the complexity of our tax structure we have had errors in our financial statements in the calculation of our tax provision that previously resulted in restatements of our prior year financial results although we believe that we have implemented appropriate internal control over financial reporting related to the computation of our income tax provision we cannot be certain that any measures we have taken or may take in the future will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and that we will avoid any material weakness in the future in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements in addition we grant performancebased equity awards to certain of our employees it is difficult to predict if or when an accounting charge associated with these grants will occur as a result we may be unable to accurately anticipate the magnitude and timing of any such accounting charge which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations in future periods 

our products must meet exacting specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

 

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is one year which exposes the company to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support delays in cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

 

  

  

 

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

 

the price and availability of commodities eg gold platinum copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may affect our business and results of operations 

 

our products incorporate commodities such as gold platinum copper and silicon the price and availability of these commodities and other like commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

 

devaluation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the renminbi may adversely affect results of operations 

 

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future should the value of the renminbi continue to rise against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition because we collect payments from all customers in us dollars fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could have an adverse impact on our customers’ business which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

 

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

 

most of our manufacturing partners are located in china in addition we have established a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facility in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our testing facility in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

 

we have a testing facility in china that began operations in 2006 in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we face the following risks among others 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to maintain our testing facility in china at fully operational status with appropriate manufacturing controls and cost levels we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

 

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future which could harm our revenues and gross profits 

 

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our margins 

 

  

  

 

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

 

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures must be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

 

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands or our business including design cycles our business could be harmed 

if we fail to retain key employees in sales applications finance and legal or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

 

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal staff maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal controls that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

 

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

 

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships andor acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

 

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities and we may be unable to successfully integrate these companies into our operations which would adversely affect our business 

 

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities andor incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles such actions by us could impact our operating results andor the price of our common stock 

 

  

  

 

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisition for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings 

 

to the extent we are successful in completing strategic acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our competitors to include but not be limited to fairchild semiconductor intersil linear maxim integrated products micrel microsemi national semiconductor o2micro richtek rohm semtech stmicroelectronic texas instruments and volterra we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market 

 

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

 

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

because of their significant stock ownership our officers and directors will be able to exert significant influence over our future direction 

 

executive officers directors and affiliated entities beneficially owned in aggregate approximately 18 of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2011 these stockholders if acting together would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 

 

  

  

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

 

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer supplier our ic testing facility a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

 

our facilities in chengdu china are located in a seismically active area as evidenced by the may 2008 earthquake that was centered in the sichuan province of china although there was no damage to our facilities as a result of that earthquake should there be additional earthquakes in the area we may incur losses and our business financial condition andor operating results may suffer 

 

we have a sales facility in japan which is located in a seismically active area as evidenced by the march 2011 earthquake that was centered off the coast of japan’s miyagi prefecture while there was no damage to our facilities as a result of the earthquake our customers may have experienced disruptions in their supply chains that may impact our revenue in future quarters additional earthquakes in the region may have a more significant impact longer term which could affect our results of operations and financial conditions

 item 2 properties 

  

our primary operating locations are currently in san jose california and chengdu sichuan china we currently lease approximately 55110 square feet in san jose which serves as our corporate headquarters sales and research and development center certain test procedures and manufacturing also take place in our san jose facility the san jose facility was sold and the new landlord has exercised their right to terminate the lease effective april 18 2012 

on july 8 2011 we entered into a standard offer agreement and escrow instruction for purchase of real estate with pepper landgreat oaks llc a california limited liability company to purchase the property located at 79 great oaks boulevard in san jose ca  to be used as our new headquarters and sales offices such property consists of an approximately 106262 square foot office building and approximately 55 acres of land 

we lease approximately 56000 square feet in chengdu which serves as our test facility and manufacturing hub and we constructed a 150000 square foot research and development facility in chengdu which was put into operation in october 2010 

we also lease sales and research and development offices in the united states japan china taiwan finland and korea we believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current operations 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

on september 16 2011 and september 29 2011 two nearly identical shareholder derivative actions were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california and the california superior court for santa clara county naming as defendants certain of our current and former directors and officers and our compensation advisory firm the complaints assert claims for among other things breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the directors approval of compensation for our executive officers during 2010 the complaints each seek an award of damages in favor of the company equitable relief costs and attorney’s fees on february 29 2012 the plaintiff in the action filed in california superior court for santa clara county had voluntarily dismissed the action the matters are at a preliminary stage at the united states district court the defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in the court in management’s opinion the resolution of the derivative action filed in the united states district court is uncertain and we are not able to assess whether it will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

 

we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to actions and proceedings incident to our business in the ordinary course of business including litigation regarding our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property and claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others these proceedings often involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend we defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

  

  

overview 

 

we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we currently offer products that serve multiple markets including flat panel televisions wireless communications telecommunications equipment general consumer products notebook computers and set top boxes among others we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as in new product categories 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

 

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits “ics” this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths 

 

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters to achieve revenue and volume production is usually achieved several months after we receive an initial customer order for a new product typical lead time for orders are fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult

 

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements or direct sales to customers in asia where the components we produce are incorporated into an enduser product 90 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 and 87 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which services the consumer electronics communications and computing markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation longterm investments shortterm investments inventories income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” – accounting standards codification “asc” 60510s25 revenue recognition – overall – recognition  asc 60510s25 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed and determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectability of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in our generally recognizing revenue upon shipment when title passes to customers 

  

approximately 90 of our distributor sales including sales to our valueadded resellers are made through distribution arrangements with third parties these arrangements do not include any special payment terms our normal payment terms are 3045 days for our distributors with valueadded resellers having payment terms up to 90 days price protection or exchange rights returns are limited to our standard product warranty certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases in return for a compensating new order of equal or greater dollar value 

 

  

  

our revenue consists primarily of assembled and tested finished goods we also sell die in wafer form to our customers and valueadded resellers and receive royalty revenue from third parties and valueadded resellers 

we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per distributor basis where available and information related to products in the distribution channel this reserve is recorded at the time of sale in the future if we are unable to estimate our stock rotation returns accurately we may not be able to recognize revenue from sales to our distributors based on when we sell inventory to our distributors instead we may have to recognize revenue when the distributor sells through such inventory to an endcustomer 

we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the distributor for the following reasons based on asc 60515251 revenue recognition – products – recognition – sales of products when right of return exists  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we enter into arrangements that have rights of return that are not estimable we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributor has sold our products to an end customer 

approximately 10 of our distributor sales are made through small distributors based on purchase orders rather than formal distribution arrangements these distributors do not receive any stock rotation rights and as such hold very little inventory if any we do not have a history of accepting returns from these distributors and they are generally required to pay in advance of shipment 

the terms in a majority of the companys distribution agreements include the nonexclusive right to sell and the agreement to use best efforts to promote and develop a market for the companys products in certain regions of the world and the ability to terminate the distribution agreement by either party with up to three months notice the company provides a one year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under this warranty the company will either repair the goods or provide replacements at no charge to the customer for defective products estimated warranty returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 

 

two of the companys us distributors have distribution agreements where revenue is recognized upon sale by these distributors to their end customers because these distributors have certain rights of return which management believes are not estimable the deferred revenue balance from these distributors for each of the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 was 10 million 

 

inventory valuation   we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required on the contrary if market conditions are more favorable we may be able to sell inventory that was previously reserved 

 

accounting for income taxes    asc 74010 income taxes – overall prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure in accordance with asc 74010 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure 

 

  

  

  

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had a valuation allowance of 146 million and 168 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets in the united states will not be realized should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

 

contingencies  we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to actions and proceedings incident to our business in the ordinary course of business including litigation regarding our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property and claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities using asc 45020252 contingencies – loss contingencies  recognition to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with asc 45020252 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations which may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations 

 

accounting for stockbased compensation   we account for stockbased compensation under the provisions of asc 7181030 compensation – stock compensation – overall – initial measurement  this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period    we currently use the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of our sharebased payments the blackscholes optionpricing model is based on a number of assumptions including historical volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends the amount of stockbased compensation that we recognize is also based on an expected forfeiture rate if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stockbased compensation costs and the actual forfeitures which become known over time we may change the forfeiture rate which could have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

warranty reserves   we currently provide a 12month warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods or provide replacement products at no charge to the customer for defective products we record estimated warranty costs by product which are based on historical experience over the preceding 12 months at the time we recognize product revenue reserve requirements are recorded in the period of sale and are based on an assessment of the products sold with warranty and historical warranty costs incurred as the complexity of our products increases we could experience higher warranty claims relative to sales than we have previously experienced and we may need to increase these estimated warranty reserves 

 

  

  

fair value of financial instruments asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures – overall defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the three categories as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asc 820103551 fair value measurement and disclosure – overall – subsequent measurement – determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures – overall  when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 

 

our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates fair market value shortterm and longterm investments are stated at their fair market value 

 

at december 31 2011 the face value of our holdings in auction rate securities is 144 million all of which is classified as longterm availableforsale investments 

  

all of the companys investments are classified as availableforsale securities which are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized through shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet we record an impairment charge to earnings when an availableforsale investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary investments in trading securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

 

we adopted the provisions of asc 3201035 investments – debt and equity securities – overall – subsequent measurement and asc 3201050 investments – debt and equity securities – overall  disclosure effective april 1 2009 and used the guidelines therein to determine whether the impairment is temporary or otherthan temporary otherthantemporary impairment charges exist when the entity has the intent to sell the security or it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery during the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized a credit loss of 70000 which was deemed to be otherthantemporary in other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations there have been no such losses since 

 

based on certain assumptions described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k we recorded impairment charges on our holdings in auctionrate securities the valuation of these securities is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

  

  

 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201105 relating to comprehensive income topic 220 – presentation of comprehensive income asu 201105 which requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after december 15 2011 and must be applied retrospectively the company is evaluating the impact asu 201105 will have on its consolidated financial statements 

 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201104 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and international financial reporting standards topic 820 – fair value measurement asu 201104 to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards asu 201104 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after december 15 2011 and should be applied prospectively

revenue revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 was 1965 million a decrease of 223 million or 102 from 2188 million for the year ended december 31 2010 for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in revenue over the same periods last year was largely attributable to a decrease in the sales of our dc to dc products primarily from having lost certain customers in korea as a result of a lack of production capacity and resulting product shortages in 2010 audio sales were down for the year ended december 31 2011 over the same period in 2010 due to a change in product mix the sales of our lighting control products were down for the year ended december 31 2011 over the similar period in 2010 because of a reduction in the demand for our ccfl products which was partially offset by increased sales of our wled products 

 

  

  

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 was 2188 million an increase of 538 million or 326 from 1650 million for the year ended december 31 2009 sales during the first three quarters of 2010 were strong for mps and the semiconductor industry in general however due to product shortages early in 2010 several major customers in korea sought alternative suppliers which impacted our revenue in the fourth quarter in addition in the fourth quarter of 2010 sales were lower because distributors used up inventory that was shipped in the third quarter and the general demand for consumer products declined more than seasonally sales during 2009 were generally weak primarily from the deterioration in the general demand for electronic products as a result of a worldwide financial crisis and associated macroeconomic slowdowns 

 

in 2010 we saw an increase in demand for our dc to dc products with sales having increased by 595 million or 481 over sales in 2009 the increase was primarily because of higher demand for electronic products in the consumer and communications markets sales of our lighting control products increased slightly as a result of greater demand for our wled solution for consumer electronics products this was partially offset by a reduction in the demand for our ccfl products audio sales were down year over year due to lower demand and a decline in the average selling price for certain of our audio products 

gross profit   gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin was 517 for the year ended december 31 2011 and 555 for the year ended december 31 2010 for the year ended december 31 2011 gross margin declined yearoveryear as a result of declining average selling prices for certain of our products unabsorbed test manufacturing costs and an increase in inventory reserves 

gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin was 555 for the year ended december 31 2010 and 592 for the year ended december 31 2009 gross margin declined yearoveryear as a result of a change in the product mix higher product costs from increased wafer and gold costs underutilized capacity towards the end of 2010 and an increase in inventory reserves 

 

research and development research and development rd expenses consist of salary and benefit expenses for design and product engineers expenses related to new product development and related facility costs 

 

 

 

rd expenses were 445 million or 227 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 and 444 million or 203 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 for the year ended december 31 2011 rd expenses remained flat over the same period in 2010 due to lower cashbased compensation and stockbased compensation expenses these were partially offset by an increase in personnelrelated and new product development expenses 

 

rd expenses were 444 million or 203 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 and 383 million or 232 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to an increase in variable compensation facilities costs and costs associated with new product development 

 

selling general and administrative selling general and administrative sga expenses include salary and benefit expenses for sales marketing and administrative personnel sales commissions travel expenses related facilities costs outside legal and accounting fees and fees associated with sarbanesoxley compliance requirements 

 

 

 

sga expenses were 403 million or 205 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 and 412 million or 188 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 for the year ended december 31 2011 sga expenses decreased over the same period in 2010 due to lower variable compensation and stockbased compensation expenses these were partially offset by an increase in personnelrelated expenses 

 

  

  

 

sga expenses were 412 million or 188 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 and 368 million or 223 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 sga as a percentage of revenue declined compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to the efficiencies of greater scale from increased revenues total sga expenses increased year over year due to higher stockbased compensation expenses and an increase in sales commissions and other variable compensation as a result of increased revenue in 2010 

 

litigation 

  

 

litigation expenses were 34 million or 17 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 54 million or 25 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 during the year ended december 31 2011 we incurred legal expenses primarily to recover attorneys’ fees from o2micro relating to our lawsuits with them which were resolved in the second quarter of 2010 during the year ended december 31 2010 we incurred legal expenses primarily for the defense of those lawsuits overall our litigation expense decreased as a result of us being party to fewer material litigations 

litigation expenses excluding patent litigation settlements and provision reversals were 54 million or 25 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 95 million or 57 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 as a result of settling our lawsuits involving o2micro in the second quarter of 2010 our legal expenses were significantly lower in 2010 compared to 2009 

for a more complete description of our current material litigation matters please see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 10 “litigation” of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

patent litigation settlement provision reversal 

 

 

 

there were no patent litigation settlements or provision reversals in 2011 and 2010 patent litigation provision reversal was 64 million for the year ended december 31 2009 in 2009 we completed the litigation process with respect to the lawsuit related to tse a customer the conclusion of this lawsuit resulted in recording a reversal of a patent litigation provision of approximately 74 million this provision was recorded as a patent litigation provision in the second quarter of 2007 and the reversal of this provision in 2009 is reflected in the patent litigation settlement and provision reversal item in the consolidated statement of operations in connection with the completion of this lawsuit the company also jointly terminated an escrow agreement with tse and retrieved the deposit of 74 million this recovery was reduced by certain litigation stipulations for other parties involved in the case in the amount of 10 million 

  

interest and other income   for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 interest and other income was 07 million 12 million and 10 million respectively interest income decreased from 2010 to 2011 due to lower cash and investment balances in 2011 which resulted from stock repurchase activity and the purchase of our san jose headquarters as well as interest rate declines yearoveryear interest income increased from 2009 to 2010 due to higher cash and investment balances in 201 0  partially offset by declining interest rates yearoveryear 

other expense   other expense comprised mainly of foreign exchange losses was 04 million 02 million and 04 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

income tax provision   the income tax provision for year ended december 31 2011 was 04 million or 31 of our income before income taxes this differs from the federal statutory rate of 34 primarily because our foreign income was taxed at lower rates and because of the benefit that we realized as a result of restricted units released 

 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2010 was 19 million or 59 of our income before income taxes this was lower than the federal statutory rate of 34 primarily because our foreign income was taxed at lower rates and because of the benefit that we realized as a result of stock options exercised and restricted units released 

 

  

  

 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2009 was 05 million or 24 of the pretax income respectively this differs from the us federal statutory rate of 34 primarily because our foreign income is taxed at lower rates and because of the benefit that we realized as a result of stock options exercised and restricted units released 

 

for additional information see note 8 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2011 we had working capital of 1854 million including cash and cash equivalents of 964 million and shortterm investments of 778 million compared to working capital of 1954 million including cash and cash equivalents of 480 million and shortterm investments of 1297 million as of december 31 2010 at december 31 2011 421 million of our cash and 150 million of our shortterm investments were held by our international subsidiaries and are therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations our working capital decreased yearoveryear primarily due to the cash requirements of our share repurchase program and 2011 capital expenditures which included the purchase of our new san jose headquarters more than offset the cash generated from operating activities and the proceeds received from the exercise of options and from purchases of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase program 

for the year ended december 31 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was 437 million primarily from strong operating results during the year for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was 485 million primarily due to strong operating results partially offset by an increase in inventory to support the deliveries in the first quarter of 2011 for the year ended december 31 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was 318 million primarily due to strong operating results during the year this was offset by an increase in accounts receivable  as a result of increased shipments at the end of the quarter ended december 31 2009 for which collections had not yet been made  and a decrease in accrued and longterm liabilities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2011 net cash provided by investing activities was 362 million primarily from the sale of shortterm investments to fund our stock repurchase program and to purchase our corporate headquarters in san jose california for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash used in investing activities was 338 million primarily related to the chengdu building construction and equipment purchases for our chengdu facility and the net purchase of shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2009 net cash used in investing activities was 821 million primarily related to the net purchase of shortterm investments 

 

we use professional investment management firms to manage the majority of our invested cash our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds government securities auctionrate securities and highly rated corporate notes the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes 

 

we adopted the provisions of asc 3201035 investments – debt and equity securities – overall – subsequent measurement and asc 3201050 investments – debt and equity securities – overall  disclosure effective april 1 2009 and used the guidelines therein to determine whether the impairment is temporary or otherthan temporary temporary impairment charges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within equity and has no impact on net income otherthantemporary impairment charges exist when the entity has the intent to sell the security it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery or it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security otherthantemporary impairment charges are recorded in other income expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 

our investment portfolio as of december 31 2011 included 137 million in government backed student loan auctionrate securities net of impairment charges of 07 million of which 06 million was temporary and 01 million was recorded as otherthantemporary this compares to an investment balance for auctionrate securities as of december 31 2010 of 192 million net of impairment charges of 10 million of which 09 million was temporary and 01 million was recorded as otherthantemporary in both 2011 and 2010 the portion of the impairment classified as temporary was based on the following analysis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

based on the guidance of asc 3201035 and asc 3201050 the company evaluated the potential credit loss of each of the auctionrate securities that are currently held by the company based on such analysis the company determined that those securities that are not 100 ffelps guaranteed are potentially subject to credit risks based on the extent to which the underlying debt is collateralized and the securityspecific studentloan default rates the company’s portfolio includes two such securities the senior parity ratio for the two securities is approximately 106 if therefore the studentloan default rate and borrowing rate increases for these issuers the remaining balance in these trusts may not be sufficient to cover the senior debt the company therefore concluded that there is potential credit risk for these two securities and as such used the discounted cash flow model to determine the amount of credit loss to be recorded in valuing the potential credit loss the following parameters were used 20 year expected term cash flows based on the 90day tbill rates for 20 year forwards and a risk premium of 59 the amount of interest that the company was receiving on these securities when the market was last active during the year ended december 31 2009 the potential credit loss associated with these securities was 70000 which the company deemed otherthantemporary and recorded in other expense in its consolidated statement of operations during 2009 there have been no such losses since 

 

unless a rights offering or other similar offer is made to redeem at par and accepted by us we intend to hold the balance of these investments through successful auctions at par which we believe could take approximately 20 years 

 

the valuation of the auctionrate securities is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others to determine the fair value of the auctionrate securities at december 31 2010 march 31 2011 june 30 2011 september 30 2011 and december 31 2011 we used a discounted cash flow model for which there are three valuation parameters including timetoliquidity discount rate and expected return the following are the values used in the discounted cash flow model 

 

 

 

from the third quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2011 the impairment increased slightly because of an increase in the ffelps studentloan spread and an increase in the cost of capital this was partially offset by 20 million in auctionrate securities having been called at par 

 

from the second quarter of 2011 to the third quarter of 2011 the impairment decreased primarily due to 17 million in auctionrate securities having been called at par this was slightly offset by an increase in the ffelps studentloan spread 

 

from the first quarter of 2011 to the second quarter of 2011 we kept the timetoliquidity constant at 20 years in addition the ffelps studentloan spread remained constant and the spread between the expected return and labor forwards changed very little as a result there was no change in the impairment of 08 million from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2011 

 

from the fourth quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2011 we kept the timetoliquidity constant at 20 years we sold 21 million in auctionrate securities at par and reversed the impairment related to these securities in the amount of 02 million this reduced the overall impairment from 10 million at december 31 2010 to 08 million at march 31 2011 

 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 320 million primarily from stock repurchases in the amount of 385 million which was partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the amount of 47 million and proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan of 18 million net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 was 140 million primarily related to the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of 315 million which was partially offset by the exercise of options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan in the amount of 162 million net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 was 136 million primarily from the exercise of stock options and the sale of our common stock pursuant to proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan in the amount of 130 million 

 

  

  

 

on july 27 2010 the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized mps to repurchase up to 500 million in the aggregate of its common stock between august 2 2010 and december 31 2011 in february 2011 the board of directors approved an increase from 500 million to 700 million the repurchase is now complete and the following shares have been repurchased through the open market and subsequently retired 

 

 

 

 

 

there were no shares repurchased in 2009 

 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding our operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statement of cash flows 

 

in the future in order to strengthen our financial position in the event of unforeseen circumstances or in the event we need to fund our growth in future financial periods we may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities debt or convertible debt or the sale of certain product lines andor portions of our business there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 

from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines technologies and businesses and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities debt andor cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisition through either the issuance of equity securities or borrowings if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 

contractual obligations 

  

we lease our headquarters and sales offices in san jose california the san jose facility was sold and the new landlord has exercised their right to terminate the lease effective april 18 2012 

on july 8 2011 we entered into a standard offer agreement and escrow instruction for purchase of real estate with landgreat oaks llc a california limited liability company to purchase the property located at 79 great oaks boulevard in san jose ca  to be used as our new headquarters and sales offices such property consists of an approximately 106262 square foot office building and approximately 55 acres of land the purchase price for the property was 110 million which was paid on august 4 2011 and for which the deed was recorded on august 5 2011 

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with the chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility of approximately 02 million we also have the option to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 19 million and which option became exercisable in march 2011 we will likely exercise our purchase option and enter into a purchase agreement for this facility in the future we constructed a 150000 square foot research and development facility in chengdu china which was put into operation in october 2010 

 

  

  

as of december 31 2011 our total outstanding purchase commitments were 186 million which includes wafer purchases from our three foundries and the purchase of assembly services primarily from multiple contractors in asia this compares to purchase commitments of 144 million as of december 31 2010 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years in thousands 

 

  

because of the uncertainty as to the timing of payments related to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded estimated obligations of 45 million from the table above 

off balance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2011 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of the securities and exchange commission’s regulation sk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities 

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale or trading for availableforsale investments no gains or losses are recognized by us in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired availableforsale investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 

fluctuations in interest rates of  10 could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 01 million the calculation is based on a 10 deviation from interest rates of 3 bps and takes into account the ending cash and investment balances for 2011 with assumed increases similar to that in 2011 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes in 2011 the primary functional currency of the company’s offshore operations was the local currency primarily the new taiwan dollar and the chinese yuan to date fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations however fluctuations of  10 on intercompany transactions of 438 million in such local currencies could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 44 million  

value change to longterm investments 

as of december 31 2011 all of our holdings in auction rate securities which have a face value of 144 million have failed to reset as a result of current market conditions should these auctions continue to fail and if the credit rating for these securities decline a 10 decline in the fair value could impact our results of operations by approximately 14 million 

in valuing the auctionrate securities using the discounted cash flow model a change in either the liquidity risk premium or timetoliquidity by 10 would result in less than a 01 million change in the value of our auctionrate securities portfolio

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to us including our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

 

based on our evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at december 31 2011 and provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15df our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a deficiency in design exists when a a control necessary to meet the control objective is missing or b an existing control is not properly designed so that even if the control operates as designed the control objective would not be met a deficiency in operation exists when a properly designed control does not operate as designed or when the person performing the control does not possess the necessary authority or competence to perform the control effectively a significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 in performing this assessment management used the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control— integrated framework based upon this assessment our management has concluded that as of december 31 2011 our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report included elsewhere herein on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

  

  

  

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  

while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance that their respective objectives will be met we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors and all fraud any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2011 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

monolithic power systems is a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we combine advanced process technology with our highly experienced analog designers to produce highperformance power management integrated circuits ics for dc to dc converters led drivers cold cathode fluorescent lamp ccfl backlight controllers classd audio amplifiers and other linear ics our products are used extensively in computing and network communications products flat panel tvs set top boxes and a wide variety of consumer and portable electronics products we partner with worldclass manufacturing organizations to deliver top quality ultracompact highperformance solutions through productive costefficient channels founded in 1997 and headquartered in san jose california we have expanded our global presence with offices in taiwan china korea japan and europe which operate under mps international ltd 

  

industry overview 

  

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or as ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets   we focus on the market for ‘high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics ‘high performance’ products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish analog and mixedsignal ic markets from digital ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market these factors include longer product life cycles   numerous market segments technology   that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have however targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

products and applications 

  

we currently have three primary product families that address multiple applications within the computing consumer electronics communications and industrialautomotive markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

  

direct current dc to dc converters dc to dc converter ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers set top boxes tvs and monitors automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc converters are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration high voltage operation high load current and high switching speed in a small footprint these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices 

lighting control products and acdc offline solutions    lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers lcd monitors car navigational systems and lcd televisions backlighting solutions are typically either wled lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfl wled lighting control ics stepup or stepdown a dc voltage or convert from an ac line voltage supplied by the utility company also called acdc offline and provide efficient precision power and protection to a led string or to multiple led strings the ccfl ics function by converting lowvoltage direct current dc or battery voltage to highvoltage alternating current ac we believe our ccfl ics were the first to utilize a full bridge resonant topology that allows for high efficiency extended lifetimes for cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfls and lower signal interference with adjacent components the full bridge topology is now the industry standard for these products 

in addition to acdc offline solutions for lighting illumination applications mps also offers acdc power conversion solutions for a diverse number of end products that plug into a wall outlet 

 

  

  

  

audio amplifiers   audio amplifier ics are used to amplify sound produced by audio processors we currently offer classd audio amplifiers which are wellsuited for applications that require both a small form factor and high power efficiency such as plasma televisions lcd televisions and dvd players with today’s systems becoming smaller and utilizing larger amounts of power solution sizes and the management of heat dissipation are becoming increasingly important to the overall system design the high degree of power efficiency and small form factor provided by our classd audio amplifiers allows system vendors to significantly reduce heat dissipation eliminating the costly and sizable fans and heat sinks traditionally required by audio amplifier ics these features enable our customers to achieve their design and cost objectives without sacrificing sound quality 

 

we currently target our products at the consumer electronics communications and computing markets with the consumer market representing the largest portion of our revenue 

 

the following is a brief summary of our product family solutions for various applications for each of these applications we are currently shipping product or have design wins which are decisions by original equipment manufacturers or oems or original design manufacturers or odms to use our ics 

  

 

we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter ic product family to the computing consumer electronics and communications markets in the future we will continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families such as high current high voltage small form factor switching voltage regulators as well as expand our newer product families in battery chargers voltage references and low dropout regulators our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of greater china expand our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

please refer to the table showing our revenue by product family in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations” 

 

  

  

customers sales and marketing 

  

we sell our products through third party distributors valueadded resellers and directly to oems odms and electronic manufacturing service ems providers our third party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors may distribute our products to end customers which include oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers the following is a summary for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 of those customers that accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in one or more of these years 

 

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor shall have the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in several countries in asia these agreements may be terminated by either us or the distributor on up to three months’ notice these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

  

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china korea and japan and have marketing representatives in europe our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems electronics containing our products 

  

because our sales are billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are not directly subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because 87 of our revenue in 2010 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our manufacturing lead times are generally 4 to 12 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in the united states china and europe with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products 

please refer to the discussion of the amount spent on research and development during each of the last three fiscal years in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations – research and development” in the area of process technology we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technology is a key strategic component to our future growth 

  

  

  

 

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of january 18 2011 we had approximately 84 patents issued and pending of which 68 have been issued in the united states our us issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through october 2028 and our other issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through august 2027 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we have entered into a patent license agreement with another integrated circuit company which is a valueadded reseller pursuant to which we have granted this company a license with certain limited sublicense rights under certain of our patents to make use and sell certain of this company’s own integrated circuit products for a period of two years ending in 2011 and for which this company is obligated to pay us royalties based on sales of those products we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights for a more complete description of our legal matters please read the section entitled item 3 legal proceedings and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and a supplier in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or supplier or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies who utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technology on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our integrated circuits 

  

we currently contract with two suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in malaysia and china the assembled ics are then sent for final testing at our chengdu facility prior to shipping to our customers 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and have exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility for approximately 02 million we also have the option to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 19 million and which becomes exercisable in march 2011 we will likely enter into a purchase agreement for this facility at a date to be determined and as the opportunity necessitates the facility has been fully operational since 2006 and we have benefitted from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs furthermore we are continuing to expand our product testing capabilities in our china facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations 

 

  

  

  

key personnel and employees 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would harm the business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2010 we employed 889 employees located in the united states taiwan china japan korea and europe 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include fairchild semiconductor international intersil corporation linear technology maxim integrated products micrel inc microsemi corporation national semiconductor corporation o2micro international richtek technology corporation rohm co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv texas instruments incorporated and volterra 

  

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive with respect to these factors particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market

 item 1a     risk factors 

 

our business involves risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements 

 

  

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

 

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the stock market in general often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

 

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and cause our stock price to decline and be volatile 

 

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

 

our profitability is dependent on many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in our operations including any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability 

 

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

 

in the past our revenues increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products due to various factors including increased competition loss of certain of our customer install base unfavorable changes in our operations reduced global electronics demand endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and ongoing litigation we may not experience growth rates comparable to past periods which could materially and adversely affect our stock price and results of operations 

 

due to product shortages early in 2010 several major customers in korea sought alternative suppliers which impacted our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 and may continue to impact our revenue in future periods if we are unable to fill this revenue gap our growth rate may be impacted which could materially and adversely affect our stock price and results of operations 

 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

 

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above the industry averages during 2010 our gross margins decreased materially as compared to 2009 should we fail to improve our gross margin in future years and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

  

  

 

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

 

we believe that the application of our products in the computer consumer electronics and communications markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

 

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

 

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct or indirect sales through distribution arrangements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 87 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographical concentration of our customers we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and financial condition 

 

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from our distribution channel and the loss of any one of these distributors or valueadded resellers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

 

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible for the year ended december 31 2010 sales to our largest distributor accounted for approximately 14 of our total revenue significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply contracts 

 

  

  

 

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 

 

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses 

 

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast specifically in the fourth quarter of 2010 demand was lower because distributors used up inventory that was shipped in the third quarter if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

our ability to increase product sales and revenues is currently constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers 

 

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us  as a result this lack of capacity has constrained our product sales and revenue growth in addition an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may materially decline in addition if we experience supply delays or limitations our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us andor seek alternative solutions to meet their demand which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

due to lack of capacity which resulted in product shortages in early 2010 several major customers in korea sought alternative suppliers which impacted our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 and may continue to impact our revenue in future periods if we are faced with capacity issues similar to what we experienced in 2010 our product sales and revenue may be further impacted which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we currently depend on two thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable andor fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

we have a supply arrangement with two suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained we many not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

 

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice under our agreement with our suppliers we have an option to order wafers based on a committed forecast that can cover a period of one to six months if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

  

  

 

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

 

all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors we do not have any longterm agreements with these subcontractors as a result we may not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition events such as the recent global economic crisis may materially impact our assembly supplier’s ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our thirdparty supplier’s manufacturing capacity 

 

we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of thirdparty supply foundries assembly shops or testing facilities for our products in order to facilitate such growth we may need to enter into strategic transactions investments and other activities such activities are subject to a number of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our thirdparty supplier’s capacity 

 

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

 

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from a third party manufacturer in advance of selling our product we place orders with our manufacturer based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturer in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the time frame that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigations or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be disposed of or would result in a decrease in our revenues in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position 

 

if we are unsuccessful in any of the legal proceedings involving us and any of our competitors we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be doubled or tripled we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products or our products or our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

 

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publiclydisclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition 

 

historically we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings which would result in our incurrence of unexpected legal expenses if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be impacted 

 

  

  

 

our ongoing legal proceedings and the potential for additional legal proceedings have diverted and may continue to divert financial and management resources 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses in addition in connection with these legal proceedings we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected further if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses our financial condition cold be adversely affected and our business could be harmed in addition our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could distract management’s focus on our operations and adversely affect our business 

we will continue to vigorously defend and enforce our intellectual property rights around the world especially as it relates to patent litigation we will take the appropriate action in various courts throughout the world and may be required to post bonds to defend such intellectual property in certain countries for an indefinite period of time until such dispute is resolved if we are not successful in defending our intellectual property we could lose revenue and the business could be harmed 

from time to time we are faced with having to defend our intellectual property rights throughout the world should we become engaged in such proceedings it could divert management’s attention from focusing on and implementing the business strategy further should we not be successful in any of our intellectual property defenses the revenue may be affected and the business could be harmed 

 

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

 

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities has suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

 

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days became illiquid in 2008 at december 31 2010 the company’s investment portfolio included 192 million net of impairment charges of 10 million in governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities as of that date 202 million the face value of our auctionrate security investments have failed to reset through successful auctions and it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 37 years   

 

based on certain assumptions described in note 2 “fair value measurements” to our consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of “item 2 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k we recorded temporary and otherthantemporary impairment charges on these investments the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others we experienced our first failed auction in midfebruary 2008 

 

should there be further deterioration in the market for auctionrate securities or if the accounting rules for these securities change the value of our portfolio may decline which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our earnings in addition it is unlikely that we will be able to liquidate our auctionrate securities in the short term 

 

  

  

 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

 

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors 

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets 

 

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

certain of our ccfl products are used to drive fluorescent lighting products which contain small amount of mercury 

 

our ccfl products are used to drive fluorescent lighting products which contain small amount of mercury this is the subject of environmental concerns particularly in europe should environmental issues impair the widespread use of our ccflbased products and should we be unable to produce replacement products based on led lighting fast enough to compensate for the loss of our ccflrelated business our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision we have hired independent tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our independent tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future we could be subject to errors which would result in us having to restate our financial statements restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting related to income taxes 

because of the complexity of our tax structure we have had errors in our financial statements in the calculation of our tax provision that previously resulted in restatements of our prior year financial results although we believe that we have implemented appropriate internal control over financial reporting related to the computation of our income tax provision we cannot be certain that any measures we have taken or may take in the future will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and that we will avoid any material weakness in the future in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the calculation of our income tax provision that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

 

  

  

our products must meet exacting specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

 

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is one year which exposes the company to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support delays in cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

 

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

 

the price and availability of commodities eg gold platinum copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may affect our business and results of operations 

 

our products incorporate commodities such as gold platinum copper and silicon the price and availability of these commodities and other like commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

 

devaluation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the chinese yuan may adversely affect results of operations 

 

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future should the value of the chinese yuan continue to rise against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition because we collect payments from all customers in us dollars fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could have an adverse impact on our customers’ business which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

 

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

 

most of our manufacturing partners are located in china in addition we have established a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facility in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our testing facility in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

 

we have a testing facility in china that began operations in 2006 in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we face the following risks among others 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

if we are unable to continue a fully operational status with appropriate controls we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

 

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future which could harm our revenues and gross profits 

 

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our margins 

 

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

 

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures must be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process which averages six to twelve months requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional three to six months after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

 

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business 

 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands or our business including design cycles our business could be harmed 

if we fail to retain key employees in sales applications finance and legal or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

 

if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales applications financial and legal staff maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal controls that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

 

  

  

 

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

 

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships andor acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

 

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities and we may be unable to successfully integrate these companies into our operations which would adversely affect our business 

 

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities andor incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles such actions by us could impact our operating results andor the price of our common stock 

 

in addition we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisition for various reasons including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings 

 

to the extent we are successful in completing strategic acquisitions if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies businesses or assets include those associated with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financing and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our competitors to include but not be limited to fairchild semiconductor intersil linear maxim integrated products micrel microsemi national semiconductor o2micro richtek rohm semtech stmicroelectronic texas instruments and volterra we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market 

 

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

 

  

  

 

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

because of their significant stock ownership our officers and directors will be able to exert significant influence over our future direction 

 

executive officers directors and affiliated entities beneficially owned in aggregate approximately 17 of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2010 these stockholders if acting together would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 

 

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

 

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer supplier our ic testing facility a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

 

our facilities in chengdu china are located in a seismically active area as evidenced by the may 2008 earthquake that was centered in the sichuan province of china although there was no damage to our facilities as a result of that earthquake should there be additional earthquakes in the area we may incur losses and our business financial condition andor operating results may suffer 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

  

our primary operating locations are currently in san jose california and chengdu sichuan china we currently lease approximately 55110 square feet in san jose which serves as our corporate headquarters sales and research and development center certain test procedures and manufacturing also take place in our san jose facility the san jose facility was sold and the new landlord has exercised their right to terminate the lease effective april 18 2012 

we lease approximately 56000 square feet in chengdu which serves as our test facility and manufacturing hub and we constructed a 150000 square foot research and development facility in chengdu which was put into operation in october 2010 we also lease sales and research and development offices in the united states japan china taiwan and korea we believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current operations 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

o2micro 

we have been engaged in a number of legal proceedings involving patent infringement claims with o2micro inc and its parent corporation o2micro international limited referred to hereinafter as “o2micro” there are two proceedings both involving o2micro’s us patent no 7417382 ‘382 patent on june 18 2010 the us international trade commission issued a final determination finding of no violation of section 337 by us or our customers in an action brought by o2micro international ltd in 2008 an international trade commission “itc” administrative law judge had previously issued an initial determination on april 20 2010 that also found no violation the itcs final determination concludes that none of our accused products infringes o2micros us patent no 7417382 the 382 patent 

 

in addition to the matter before the itc a related case is pending before the northern district of california court in oakland california subsequent to the itc’s final determination finding of no violation o2micro filed a motion to dismiss its claims for infringement of the 382 patent with prejudice and covenanted not to sue us or any of our distributors or customers for infringement of the 382 patent on june 23 2010 the court granted this motion and vacated the jury trial that was scheduled on july 12 2010 we filed a motion seeking recovery of costs and attorney fees from o2micro on march 3 2011 the court issued an order granting our motion in part it ordered o2micro to pay 339315 in costs forthwith and ordered the parties to meet and confer to try to reach an agreement as to the reasonable attorneys fees to be paid if the parties are unable to reach an agreement we are to submit detailed documentation to the court in support of our fees request 

 

  

  

linear technology corporation 

on july 1 2008 the united states district court for the district of delaware held as a matter of law that we did not breach our october 1 2005 settlement and license agreement with linear technology corporation “linear” based upon that ruling we anticipate filing a motion to seek recovery of our attorney fees when the final judgment is entered the court has not issued its final judgment concerning the patent validity and enforceability issues

 item 7     management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

 

we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we currently offer products that serve multiple markets including flat panel televisions wireless communications telecommunications equipment general consumer products notebook computers cellular handsets and set top boxes among others we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as in new product categories 

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

 

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits “ics” this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths 

 

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes six to twelve months to achieve revenue volume production is usually achieved in three to six months after we receive an initial customer order for a new product typical lead times for orders are fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult 

 

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements or direct sales to customers in asia where the components we produce are incorporated into an enduser product 87 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 and 84 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which services the consumer electronics communications and computing markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation longterm investments shortterm investments inventories income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates 

 

  

  

  

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” – accounting standards codification “asc” 60510s25 revenue recognition – overall – recognition  asc 60510s25 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in our generally recognizing revenue upon shipment when title passes to customers should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 

  

approximately 85 of our distributor sales including sales to our valueadded resellers are made through distribution arrangements with third parties these arrangements do not include any special payment terms our normal payment terms are 3045 days for our distributors with valueadded resellers having payment terms up to 90 days price protection or exchange rights returns are limited to our standard product warranty certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases in return for a compensating new order of equal or greater dollar value 

we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per distributor basis where available and information related to products in the distribution channel this reserve is recorded at the time of sale in the future if we are unable to estimate our stock rotation returns accurately we may not be able to recognize revenue from sales to our distributors based on when we sell inventory to our distributors instead we may have to recognize revenue when the distributor sells through such inventory to an endcustomer 

we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the distributor for the following reasons based on asc 60515251 revenue recognition – products – recognition – sales of products when right of return exists  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we enter into arrangements that have rights of return that are not estimable we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributor has sold our products to an end customer 

approximately 15 of our distributor sales are made through small distributors based on purchase orders rather than formal distribution arrangements these distributors do not receive any stock rotation rights and as such hold very little inventory if any we do not have a history of accepting returns from these distributors 

the terms in a majority of our distribution agreements include the nonexclusive right to sell and the agreement to use best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in certain regions of the world and the ability to terminate the distribution agreement by either party with up to three months notice we provide a one year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under this warranty we will repair the goods provide replacements at no charge or under certain circumstances provide a refund to the customer for defective products estimated warranty returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 

 

in 2006 we signed a distribution agreement with a us distributor revenue from this distributor is recognized upon sale by the distributor to the end customer because the distributor has certain rights of return which management believes are not estimable the deferred revenue balance from this distributor as of december 31 2010 and 2009 was 10 million and 09 million respectively 

 

  

  

 

inventory valuation   we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required on the contrary if market conditions are more favorable we may be able to sell inventory that was previously reserved 

  

accounting for income taxes    asc 74010 income taxes – overall prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure in accordance with asc 74010 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure 

  

as of december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we had a valuation allowance of 168 million 146 million and 144 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that none of the deferred tax assets will be realized except for certain deferred tax assets related to uncertain income tax positions as a result of the cost sharing arrangements with the company’s international subsidiaries cost share arrangements relatively small changes in costs that are not subject to sharing under the cost share arrangements can significantly impact the overall profitability of the us entity historically the us operations have shown an inconsistent earnings pattern due to litigation costs not subject to cost sharing the company evaluated its us valuation allowance at december 31 2010 by reviewing both its earnings history and its expected earnings for the next 12 months in its us entity because of the us entity’s inconsistent earnings history and uncertainty of future earnings the company has determined that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax benefits would not be realized we have settled most of our legacy litigation matters that resulted in litigation cost that were not subject to cost share in the past as a result during our next fiscal year a relatively small number of design wins in the us and the absence of new litigation that may be not subject to cost share may position the us entity for a stable earnings pattern as such we will continue to evaluate if our facts and circumstances warrant a reversal of the valuation allowance against the us deferred tax benefits during fiscal year 2011 

contingencies  we are engaged in legal proceedings regarding our intellectual property challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property and claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities using asc 45020252 contingencies – loss contingencies  recognition to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with asc 45020252 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations which may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations 

 

accounting for stockbased compensation   we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with asc 7181030 compensation – stock compensation – overall – initial measurement  under the modified prospective method asc 7181030 eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement to stock compensation awards issued to employees rather the standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period    we currently use the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of our sharebased payments the blackscholes optionpricing model is based on a number of assumptions including historical volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends if these assumptions change stockbased compensation may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past the amount of stockbased compensation that we recognize is also based on an expected forfeiture rate if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stockbased compensation costs and the actual forfeitures which become known over time we may change the forfeiture rate which could have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

 

  

  

 

warranty reserves   we currently provide a 12month warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods or provide replacement products at no charge to the customer for defective products we record estimated warranty costs by product which are based on historical experience over the preceding 12 months at the time we recognize product revenue reserve requirements are recorded in the period of sale and are based on an assessment of the products sold with warranty and historical warranty costs incurred there have been situations where we have recognized warranty reserves for specific claims separate from our historical run rates as the complexity of our products increases we could experience higher warranty claims relative to sales than we have previously experienced and we may need to increase these estimated warranty reserves 

fair value of financial instruments asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures – overall defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the three categories as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

asc 820103551 fair value measurement and disclosure – overall – subsequent measurement – determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures – overall  when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 

 

our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates fair market value based on quoted market prices shortterm and longterm investments are stated at their fair market value 

 

at december 31 2010 the face value of our holdings in auction rate securities was 202 million all of which was classified as longterm availableforsale investments investments in availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized through shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet we record an impairment charge to earnings when an availableforsale investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary investments in trading securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

 

we adopted the provisions of asc 3201035 investments – debt and equity securities – overall – subsequent measurement and asc 3201050 investments – debt and equity securities – overall  disclosure effective april 1 2009 and used the guidelines therein to determine whether the impairment is temporary or otherthan temporary otherthantemporary impairment charges exist when the entity has the intent to sell the security or it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery during the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized a credit loss of 70000 which was deemed to be otherthantemporary in other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

based on certain assumptions described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k we recorded impairment charges on our holdings in auctionrate securities the valuation of these securities is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update asu no 200913  multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  asu 200913 the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price asu 200913 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 we are currently evaluating asu 200913 and the impact if any that it may have on our results of operations or financial position 

 

  

  

  

results of operations 

 

  the table below shows the consolidated statements of operations amounts in thousands and shows each as a percentage of revenue 

 

 

 

the following table shows our revenue by product family amounts in thousands except percentages 

 

 

revenue revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 was 2188 million an increase of 538 million or 326 from 1650 million for the year ended december 31 2009 sales during the first three quarters of 2010 were strong for mps and the semiconductor industry in general however due to product shortages early in 2010 several major customers in korea sought alternative suppliers which impacted our revenue in the fourth quarter and may continue to impact our revenue in future periods in addition in the fourth quarter of 2010 sales were lower because distributors used up inventory that was shipped in the third quarter and the general demand for consumer products declined more than seasonally sales during 2009 were generally weak primarily from the deterioration in the general demand for electronic products as a result of a worldwide financial crises and associated macroeconomic slowdowns

 

in 2010 we saw an increase in demand for our dc to dc products with sales having increased by 595 million or 481 over sales in 2009 the increase was primarily because of higher demand for electronic products in the consumer and communications markets sales of our lighting control products increased slightly as a result of greater demand for our wled solution for consumer electronics products this was partially offset by a reduction in the demand for our ccfl products audio sales were down year over year due to lower demand and a decline in the average selling price for certain of our audio products 

 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 was 1650 million an increase of 45 million or 28 from 1605 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in revenue between these two periods resulted primarily from increased sales of our dc to dc products of 82 million as a result of an increase in demand for electronic products in the consumer and communications markets this was partially offset by a decrease in the sales of our lighting control products in the amount of 45 million as a result of the continuing shift of notebook backlighting from ccfl solutions to wled solutions sales for our audio products for the year ended december 31 2009 remained relatively flat year over year 

gross profit    gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin was 555 for the year ended december 31 2010 and 592 for the year ended december 31 2009 gross margin declined yearoveryear as a result of a change in the product mix higher product costs from increased wafer and gold costs underutilized capacity towards the end of 2010 and an increase in inventory reserves 

 

  

  

gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 592 for the year ended december 31 2009 and 619 for the year ended december 31 2008 gross margin declined yearoveryear as a result of increasing price pressure and therefore declining average selling prices and an increase in inventory reserves resulting from a decrease in the general demand for certain of our lighting control products 

 

research and development research and development rd expenses consist of salary and benefit expenses for design and product engineers expenses related to new product development and related facility costs 

 

 

 

rd expenses were 444 million or 203 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 and 383 million or 232 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to an increase in variable compensation facilities costs and costs associated with new product development 

 

rd expenses were 383 million or 232 of revenue for year ended december 31 2009 and 349 million or 217 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and new product development expenses to support new product development stockbased compensation expenses increased by 06 million primarily due to the acceleration of certain awards 

 

selling general and administrative selling general and administrative sga expenses include salary and benefit expenses for sales marketing and administrative personnel sales commissions travel expenses related facilities costs outside legal and accounting fees and fees associated with sarbanesoxley compliance requirements 

 

 

 

sga expenses were 412 million or 188 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 and 368 million or 223 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 sga as a percentage of revenue declined compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to the efficiencies of greater scale from increased revenues total sga expenses increased year over year due to higher stockbased compensation expenses and an increase in sales commissions and other variable compensation as a result of increased revenue in 2010 

 

sga expenses were 368 million or 223 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 and 353 million or 220 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 for the year ended december 31 2009 sga expenses increased compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to an increase in sales and salesrelated expenses stockbased compensation increased by 10 million primarily related to certain severance arrangements and the acceleration of certain awards

litigation expenses excluding patent litigation settlements and provision reversals were 54 million or 25 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 95 million or 57 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 as a result of settling our lawsuits involving o2micro in the second quarter of 2010 our legal expenses were significantly lower in 2010 compared to 2009 

litigation expenses excluding patent litigation settlements and provision reversals were 95 million or 57 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 67 million or 42 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 during the year ended december 31 2009 we incurred significant legal expenses to defend our lawsuit against o2micro during the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred significant legal expenses to defend our lawsuit against linear technology  

 

for a more complete description of our litigation matters please see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 10 “litigation” of notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

patent litigation settlement provision reversal net 

  

 

  

there were no patent litigation settlements or provision reversals in 2010 patent litigation provision reversal net was 64 million for the year ended december 31 2009 in 2009 we completed the litigation process with respect to the lawsuit related to tse a customer the conclusion of this lawsuit resulted in recording a reversal of a patent litigation provision of approximately 74 million this provision was recorded as a patent litigation provision in the second quarter of 2007 and the reversal of this provision in 2009 is reflected in the patent litigation settlement and provision reversal net item in the consolidated statement of operations in connection with the completion of this lawsuit the company also jointly terminated an escrow agreement with tse and retrieved the deposit of 74 million this recovery was reduced by certain litigation stipulations for other parties involved in the case in the amount of 10 million 

  

interest and other income   for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 interest and other income was 12 million 10 million and 36 million respectively interest rates remained low in 2010 resulting in a small increase in interest income as our cash and investment balances grew year over year for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 despite year over year increases in cash cash equivalents and investment balances interest income decreased due to significant declines in interest rates as a result of the economic downturn  

other expense   other expense comprised mainly of foreign exchange losses was 02 million 04 million and 07 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

income tax provision    the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2010 was 19 million or 59 of our income before income taxes this was lower than the federal statutory rate of 34 primarily because our foreign income was taxed at lower rates and because of the benefit that we realized as a result of stock options exercised and restricted units released  

 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2009 was 05 million or 24 of the pretax income respectively this differs from the us federal statutory rate of 34 primarily because our foreign income is taxed at lower rates and because of the benefit that we realized as a result of stock options exercised and restricted units released 

 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2008 was 12 million or 48 of our income before income taxes this was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 34 due primarily to a benefit from earnings in low foreign tax jurisdictions and a decrease in prioryear uncertain tax position reserves under asc 74010 which was partially offset by an increase in currentyear asc 74010 reserves additional asc 74010 interest accruals an increase in the valuation allowance in the us and nondeductible stock option compensation expenses

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2010 we had working capital of 1954 million including cash and cash equivalents of 480 million and shortterm investments of 1297 million compared to working capital of 1796 million including cash and cash equivalents of 467 million and shortterm investments of 1189 million as of december 31 2009 our working capital increased yearoveryear primarily due to cash generated from operating activities and the proceeds received from the exercise of options and from the employee stock purchase program 

  

for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was 485 million primarily due to strong operating results partially offset by an increase in inventory to support the deliveries in the first quarter of 2011 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was 318 million primarily due to strong operating results during the year this was offset by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased shipments at the end of the quarter ended december 31 2009 for which collections had not yet been made and a decrease in accrued and longterm liabilities for the year ended december 31 2008 net cash provided by operating activities was 396 million primarily due to strong operating results 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash used in investing activities was 338 million primarily related to the chengdu building construction and equipment purchases for our chengdu facility and the net purchase of shortterm investments  for the year ended december 31 2009 net cash used in investing activities was 821 million primarily related to the net purchase of shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2008 net cash used in investing activities was 296 million primarily related to the purchase of 281 million in auctionrate securities which became illiquid in february 2008  and the purchase of 52 million in capital equipment this was offset by the release of 86 million in restricted assets as a result of an agreement between o2micro and us relating to certain legal proceedings in taiwan 

 

we use professional investment management firms to manage the majority of our invested cash our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds government securities auctionrate securities and highly rated corporate notes the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes 

 

we adopted the provisions of asc 3201035 investments – debt and equity securities – overall – subsequent measurement and asc 3201050 investments – debt and equity securities – overall  disclosure effective april 1 2009 and used the guidelines therein to determine whether the impairment is temporary or otherthan temporary temporary impairment charges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within equity and have no impact on net income otherthantemporary impairment charges exist when the entity has the intent to sell the security or it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery otherthantemporary impairment charges are recorded in other income expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 

at december 31 2010 the company’s investment portfolio included 192 million net of impairment charges of 10 million in governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 37 years although it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity management has concluded that as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the cumulative impairment of 10 million and 11 million respectively was temporary based on the following analysis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

based on the guidance of asc 3201035 and asc 3201050 the company evaluated the potential credit loss of each of the auctionrate securities that are currently held by the company based on such analysis the company determined that those securities that are not 100 ffelps guaranteed are potentially subject to credit risks based on the extent to which the underlying debt is collateralized and the securityspecific studentloan default rates the company’s portfolio includes three such securities one of which has a senior parity ratio of approximately 126 which is substantially above the expected studentloan default rate for that security conversely the senior parity ratio for the other two securities is approximately 105 if therefore the studentloan default rate and borrowing rate increases for these issuers the remaining balance in these trusts may not be sufficient to cover the senior debt the company therefore concluded that there is potential credit risk for these two securities and as such used the discounted cash flow model to determine the amount of credit loss to be recorded in valuing the potential credit loss the following parameters were used 20 year expected term cash flows based on the 90day tbill rates for 20 year forwards and a risk premium of 59 the amount of interest that the company was receiving on these securities when the market was last active as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the potential credit loss associated with these securities was 70000 which the company deemed otherthantemporary and recorded in other expense in its consolidated statement of operations during 2009 

 

unless another rights offering or other similar offers are made to redeem at par and accepted by us we intend to hold the balance of these investments through successful auctions at par which we believe could take approximately 20 years 

 

the valuation of the auctionrate securities is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others to determine the fair value of the auctionrate securities at december 31 2009 march 31 2010 june 30 2010  september 30 2010 and december 31 2010 we used a discounted cash flow model for which there are three valuation parameters including timetoliquidity discount rate and expected return the following are the values used in the discounted cash flow model 

 

 

 

in october 2008 the company accepted an offer to participate in an auctionrate security rights offering from ubs to sell up to 182 million in face value of eligible auctionrate securities commencing in june 2010 between october 2008 and june 2010 96 million of these auctionrate securities were called at par on june 30 2010 the company exercised the ubs put right and sold the remaining 86 million in auction rate securities at par for which the sale was completed and proceeds were received on july 1 2010 at december 31 2009 we had 169 million in eligible auctionrate securities remaining at ubs the impairment related to these auctionrate securities and the corresponding put right were valued at 07 million the change in the impairment and the fair value of the put right was recorded in accordance with the provisions of asc 3201035 and asc 3201050 in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

from the end of the third quarter of 2010 to the end of the fourth quarter of 2010 we sold 02 million in auctionrate securities at par however the ffelpsguaranteed studentloan credit default spread and the spread between the 90day libor and tbill forward rates increased the net effect of the adjustments was an increase in the overall impairment from 09 million at september 30 2010 to 10 million at december 31 2010 

 

from the end of the second quarter of 2010 to the end of the third quarter of 2010 we kept the timetoliquidity constant at 20 years there was a slight decrease in the spread between the 90day libor and tbill forward rates as well as a small decrease in the ffelpsguaranteed studentloan credit default spread we also sold 88 million in auctionrate securities at par all of which was related to the exercise of the ubs put right the net effect of the adjustments was a reduction in the overall impairment from 13 million at june 30 2010 to 09 million at september 30 2010 

 

from the end of the first quarter of 2010 to the end of the second quarter of 2010 we kept the timetoliquidity constant at 20 years the spread between the 90day libor and tbill forward rates remained relatively constant we sold 81 million in auction rate securities at par all of which were held at ubs however the ffelpsguaranteed studentloan credit default spread increased slightly the net effect of the adjustments was a reduction in the overall impairment from 15 million at march 31 2010 to 13 million at june 30 2010 the overall impairment decreased primarily because we sold a large amount of auctionrate securities back to ubs at par this was partially offset by a slight increase in the ffelpsguaranteed studentloan credit default spread 

 

  

  

 

from the end of the fourth quarter of 2009 to the end of the first quarter of 2010 we kept the timetoliquidity constant at 20 years we sold 02 million in auctionrate securities at par the spread between the 90day libor and tbill forward rate decreased and the ffelpsguaranteed studentloan credit default spread decreased the net effect of the adjustments was a reduction in the overall impairment from 18 million at december 31 2009 to 15 million at march 31 2010 

 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 was 140 million primarily related to the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of 315 million which was partially offset by the exercise of options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan in the amount of 162 million net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 was 136 million primarily from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan in the amount of 130 million  

 

net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 was 98 million primarily from the repurchase of 250 million of our common stock this was partially offset by the proceeds related to the exercise of options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan of common stock in the amount of 145 million and excess tax benefits related to the exercise of options of 08 million 

 

on july 27 2010 we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to 500 million of its common stock between august 2 2010 and december 31 2011 in february 2011 the board of directors approved an increase from 500 million to 700 million as of december 31 2010 the following shares have been repurchased through the open market and subsequently retired 

 

 

 

there were no repurchases in 2009 

 

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding our operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statement of cash flows 

 

in the future in order to strengthen our financial position in the event of unforeseen circumstances or in the event we need to fund our growth in future financial periods we may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity securities debt or convertible debt or the sale of certain product lines andor portions of our business there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 

from time to time we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines technologies and businesses and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities debt andor cash consideration we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisition through either the issuance of equity securities or borrowings if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 

contractual obligations 

  

we lease our headquarters and sales offices in san jose california the san jose facility was sold and the new landlord has exercised their right to terminate the lease effective april 18 2012 

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with the chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility of approximately 02 million we also have the option to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 19 million and which becomes exercisable in march 2011 we will likely enter into a purchase agreement for this facility at a date to be determined and as the opportunity necessitates 

 

as of december 31 2010 our total outstanding purchase commitments were 144 million which includes wafer purchases from our two foundries the purchase of assembly services primarily from multiple contractors in asia and purchase commitments related to the construction of our chengdu facility this compares to purchase commitments of 132 million as of december 31 2009  

 

  

  

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years in thousands 

 

 

 

because of the uncertainty as to the timing of payments related to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded estimated obligations of 50 million after considering the valuation allowance from the table above 

off balance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2010 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of the securities and exchange commission’s regulation sk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities 

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale or trading for availableforsale investments no gains or losses are recognized by us in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired availableforsale investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 

fluctuations in interest rates of  10 could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 01 million  

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes in 2010 the primary functional currency of the company’s offshore operations was the local currency primarily the new taiwan dollar and the chinese yuan to date fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations however fluctuations of  10 in such local currencies could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 42 million  

value change to longterm investments 

as of december 31 2010 all of our holdings in auction rate securities which have a face value of 202 million have failed to reset as a result of current market conditions should these auctions continue to fail and if the credit rating for these securities decline a 10 decline in the fair value could impact our results of operations by approximately 20 million  

in valuing the auctionrate securities using the discounted cash flow model a change in either the liquidity risk premium or timetoliquidity by 10 would result in a 01 million change in the value of our auctionrate securities portfolio

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to us including our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

 

based on our evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at december 31 2010 and provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15df our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a deficiency in design exists when a a control necessary to meet the control objective is missing or b an existing control is not properly designed so that even if the control operates as designed the control objective would not be met a deficiency in operation exists when a properly designed control does not operate as designed or when the person performing the control does not possess the necessary authority or competence to perform the control effectively a significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 in performing this assessment management used the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control— integrated framework based upon this assessment our management has concluded that as of december 31 2010 our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report included elsewhere herein on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

 

  

  

  

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  

while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance that their respective objectives will be met we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors and all fraud any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2010 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

general 

  

monolithic power systems designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we combine advanced process technology with our highly experienced analog designers to produce highperformance power management integrated circuits ics for dc to dc converters led drivers cold cathode fluorescent lamp ccfl backlight controllers classd audio amplifiers and other linear ics our products are used extensively in computing and network communications products flat panel tvs set top boxes and a wide variety of consumer and portable electronics products we partner with worldclass manufacturing organizations to deliver top quality ultracompact highperformance solutions through productive costefficient channels founded in 1997 and headquartered in san jose california we have expanded our global presence with offices in taiwan china korea japan and europe which operate under mps international ltd 

  

industry overview 

  

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or as ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for ‘high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics ‘high performance’ products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish analog and mixedsignal ic markets from digital ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have however targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

products and applications 

  

we currently have three primary product families that address multiple applications within the computing consumer electronics and communications markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

  

direct current dc to dc converters dc to dc converter ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers set top boxes automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc converters are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their 

  

high degree of integration and rapid switching speeds these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices 

  

lighting control products lighting control ics are used in backlighting and general illumination products lighting control ics for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers lcd monitors car navigational systems and lcd televisions backlighting solutions are typically either cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfl or wled lighting sources the ccfl ics function by converting lowvoltage direct current dc or battery voltage to highvoltage alternating current ac we believe our ccfl ics were the first to utilize a full bridge resonant topology that allows for high efficiency extended lifetimes for cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfls and lower signal interference with adjacent components the full bridge topology is now the industry standard for these products wled lighting control ics stepup or stepdown a dc voltage and provide efficient precision power and protection to a led string or to multiple led strings 

  

audio amplifiers audio amplifier ics are used to amplify sound produced by audio processors we currently offer classd audio amplifiers which are wellsuited for applications that require both a small form factor and high power efficiency such as plasma televisions lcd televisions and dvd players with today’s systems becoming smaller and utilizing larger amounts of power solution sizes and the management of heat dissipation are becoming increasingly important to the overall system design the high degree of power efficiency and small form factor provided by our classd audio amplifiers allows system vendors to significantly reduce heat dissipation eliminating the costly and sizable fans and heat sinks traditionally required by audio amplifier ics these features enable our customers to achieve their design and cost objectives without sacrificing sound quality 

  

we currently target our products at the consumer electronics communications and computing markets with the consumer market representing the largest portion of our revenue 

  

the following is a brief summary of our product family solutions for various applications for each of these applications we are currently shipping product or have design wins which are decisions by original equipment manufacturers or oems or original design manufacturers or odms to use our ics 

  

   

we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter ic product family to the computing consumer electronics and communications markets in the future we will continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families such as high current high voltage small form factor switching voltage regulators as well as expand our newer product families in battery chargers voltage references and low dropout regulators our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of greater china expand our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

please refer to the table showing our revenue by product family in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations” 

  

customers sales and marketing 

  

we sell our products through third party distributors valueadded resellers and directly to oems odms and electronic manufacturing service ems providers our third party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors may distribute our products to end customers which include oems odms or ems providers our valueadded resellers may second source our products and provide other services to customers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and ems providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers the following is a summary for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 of those customers that accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in one or more of these years 

  

   

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor shall have the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in several countries in asia these agreements may be terminated by either us or the distributor on up to three months’ notice these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

  

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china korea and japan and have marketing representatives in europe our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems electronics containing our products 

  

because our sales are billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are not directly subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because 84 of our revenue in 2009 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped our shippable backlog at december 31 2009 was 278 million we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of our future sales order lead times may vary and as is common within our industry customers are allowed to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice our quarterly revenue is also influenced by orders booked and shipped within that quarter which are not reflected as backlog at the end of any preceding quarter our manufacturing lead times are generally 4 to 12 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in the united states china and europe with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products 

  

please refer to the discussion of the amount spent on research and development during each of the last three fiscal years in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—research and development” in the area of process technology we are investing research and development resources to provide leadingedge analog power processes for our next generation of integrated circuits process technology is a key strategic component to our future growth 

  

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of january 11 2010 we had approximately 309 patents issued and pending of which 55 have been issued in the united states our us issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through august 2027 and our other issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2027 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we have entered into a patent license agreement with another integrated circuit company pursuant to which we have granted this company a license with certain limited sublicense rights under certain of our patents to make use and sell certain of this company’s own integrated circuit products for a period of two years ending in 2011 and for which this company is obligated to pay us royalties based on sales of those products we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation with o2micro international limited “o2micro” and linear technology corporation “linear” for a more complete description of our legal matters please read the section entitled item 3 legal proceedings and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and a supplier in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or supplier or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies who utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technology on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our integrated circuits 

  

we currently contract with two suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in malaysia and china the assembled ics are then sent for final testing at our chengdu facility prior to shipping to our customers 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and have exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility for approximately 02 million we also have the option to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 20 million which option becomes exercisable in march 2011 we will likely enter into a purchase agreement for this facility at the end of the lease term the facility has been fully operational since 2006 and we have benefitted from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs furthermore we are continuing to expand our product testing capabilities in our china facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations 

  

key personnel and employees 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number 

  

and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would harm the business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2009 we employed 692 employees located in the united states taiwan china japan korea and europe 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include fairchild semiconductor international intersil corporation linear technology maxim integrated products micrel inc microsemi corporation national semiconductor corporation o2micro international richtek technology corporation rohm co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv texas instruments incorporated and volterra 

  

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive with respect to these factors particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

our business involves risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements 

  

if we are unsuccessful in any of the legal proceedings involving us and o2micro we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

  

we are engaged in legal proceedings with o2micro these proceedings involve various claims and counterclaims alleging among other things patent infringement o2micro has also in the past taken legal action against certain of our customers which we were obligated to indemnify other new or existing customers may request similar indemnity from us because of continued legal actions between us and o2micro see the section entitled “item 3 legal proceedings” of this annual report on form 10k for more information 

  

if we are not ultimately successful in any of these proceedings or other litigation that could be brought against us or our customer or if any of the decisions in our favor are reversed on appeal we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be doubled or tripled we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products or our products or our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

  

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publiclydisclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and business 

  

until our legal proceedings with o2micro and linear are resolved we will continue to incur significant legal expenses that vary with the level of activity in each of these proceedings this level of activity is not entirely within our control as we may need to respond to legal actions by the opposing parties or scheduling decisions by the judges consequently it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be impacted 

  

our ongoing legal proceedings and the potential for additional legal proceedings have diverted and may continue to divert financial and management resources 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation matters with o2micro and 

  

linear patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could adversely affect our business 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline 

  

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities has suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days became illiquid in 2008 as of december 31 2009 the company’s investment portfolio included 356 million net of impairment charges of 18 million in governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities as of that date 374 million the face value of our auctionrate security investments have failed to reset through successful auctions and it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 38 years 

  

based on certain assumptions described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k we recorded temporary and otherthantemporary impairment charges on these investments the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others we experienced our first failed auction in midfebruary 2008 although we accepted an offer to participate in an auctionrate securities rights offering from ubs in october 2008 to sell up to 169 million in eligible auctionrate securities held by us at par to ubs commencing in june 2010 if ubs does not follow through on its commitment to purchase the auctionrate securities at par or the auctions continue to fail the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be negatively impacted and the value of our investment portfolio could decline 

  

should there be further deterioration in the market for auctionrate securities or if the accounting rules for these securities change the value of our portfolio may decline which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our earnings 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

  

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors 

  

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets 

  

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance 

  

our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market which result in gross margins that have historically been above the industry averages should we fail to develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease 

  

we believe that the application of our products in the computer consumer electronics and communications markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

certain of our products go into tubes that contain mercury which is the subject of environmental concerns 

  

our ccfl products go into tubes that contain mercury which is the subject of environmental concerns particularly in europe should environmental issues impair the widespread use of our ccflbased products and should we be unable to produce replacement products based on led lighting fast enough to compensate for the loss of our ccflrelated business our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

  

in the past our revenues increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products due to increased competition reduced global electronics demand endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and ongoing litigation we may not experience growth rates comparable to past periods which could affect our stock price and results of operations 

  

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

  

our profitability is dependent on many factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the stock market in general often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements 

  

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision we have hired independent tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our independent tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues we could be subject to errors which would result in us having to restate our financial statements restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

  

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting related to income taxes 

  

because of the complexity of our tax structure we have had errors in our financial statements in the calculation of our tax provision that previously resulted in restatements of our prior year financial results although we believe that we have implemented appropriate internal control over financial reporting related to the computation of our income tax provision we cannot be certain that any measures we have taken or may take in the future will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and that we will avoid any material weakness in the future in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the calculation of our income tax provision that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from our distribution channel and the loss of any one of these distributors or valueadded resellers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

  

we market our products through distribution arrangements and valueadded resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible for the year ended december 31 2009 sales to our three largest distributors andor customers accounted for approximately 34 of our total revenue significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply contracts 

  

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 

  

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

our products must meet exacting specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

  

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter 

  

development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is one year which exposes the company to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support delays in cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

  

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

  

we currently depend on two thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent and are unable andor fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

  

we have a supply arrangement with two suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent we many not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue in the recent past as a result of the global economic crisis many wafer foundries in the semiconductor industry were operating well below normal capacity including the two suppliers to mps potentially impairing our suppliers’ ability to meet their financial obligations 

  

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may decline 

  

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice under our agreement with our suppliers we have an option to order wafers based on a committed forecast that can cover a period of one to six months if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

  

all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors we do not have any longterm agreements with these subcontractors as a result we may not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition the current global economic crisis may materially impact our assembly supplier’s ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

  

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct or indirect sales through distribution arrangements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 84 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business in asia and internationally in general including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the price and availability of commodities eg gold platinum copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may affect our business and results of operations 

  

our products incorporate commodities such as gold platinum copper and silicon the price and availability of these commodities and other like commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

devaluation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the chinese yuan may adversely affect results of operations 

  

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future should the value of the chinese yuan continue to rise against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition because we collect payments from all customers in us dollars fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could have an adverse impact on our customers’ business which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

  

most of our manufacturing partners are located in china in addition we have established a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facility in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our testing facility in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

  

we have a testing facility in china that began operations in 2006 in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this annual report we face the following risks among others 

  

   

   

if we are unable to continue a fully operational status with appropriate controls we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses 

  

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

  

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future which could harm our revenues and gross profits 

  

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our margins 

  

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

  

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from a third party manufacturer in advance of selling our product we place orders with our manufacturer based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturer in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the time frame that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigations or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be disposed of if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position 

  

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

  

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures must be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process which averages six to twelve months requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of 

  

products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional three to six months after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

  

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands or our business including design cycles our business could be harmed 

  

if we fail to retain key employees in sales applications finance and legal or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

  

since 2006 we significantly increased the quantity and quality of our sales applications financial and legal staff however if we fail to continue to adequately staff these areas maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal controls that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

  

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

  

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships andor acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems 

  

and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities and we may be unable to successfully integrate these companies into our operations which would adversely affect our business 

  

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership andor incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities such actions by us could impact our operating results andor the price of our common stock in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business 

  

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financing and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our competitors to include but not be limited to fairchild semiconductor intersil linear maxim integrated products micrel microsemi national semiconductor o2micro richtek rohm semtech stmicroelectronic texas instruments and volterra we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market 

  

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

  

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

because of their significant stock ownership our officers and directors will be able to exert significant influence over our future direction 

  

executive officers directors and affiliated entities beneficially owned in aggregate approximately 14 of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2009 these stockholders if acting together would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

  

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer supplier our ic testing facility a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

our facilities in chengdu china are located in a seismically active area as evidenced by the may 2008 earthquake that was centered in the sichuan province of china although there was no damage to our facilities as a result of that earthquake should there be additional earthquakes in the area we may incur losses and our business financial condition andor operating results may suffer

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report on form 10k 

  

overview 

  

we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we currently offer products that serve multiple markets including flat panel televisions wireless communications telecommunications equipment general consumer products notebook computers cellular handsets and set top boxes among others we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as in new product categories 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits “ics” this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths 

  

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes six to twelve months to achieve revenue volume production is usually achieved in three to six months after we receive an initial customer order for a new product typical lead times for orders are fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult 

  

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements or direct sales to customers in asia where the components we produce are incorporated into an enduser product 84 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 and 89 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which services the 

  

consumer electronics communications and computing markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation longterm investments shortterm investments inventories income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb”—accounting standards codification “asc” 60510s25 revenue recognition—overall—recognition  asc 60510s25 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in our generally recognizing revenue upon shipment when title passes to customers should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 

  

approximately 80 of our distributor sales are made through distribution arrangements with third parties these arrangements do not include any special payment terms our normal payment terms are 3045 days price protection or exchange rights returns are limited to our standard product warranty certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases in return for a compensating new order of equal or greater dollar value 

  

we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per distributor basis where available and information related to products in the distribution channel this reserve is recorded at the time of sale in the future if we are unable to estimate our stock rotation returns accurately we may not be able to recognize revenue from sales to our distributors based on when we sell inventory to our distributors instead we may have to recognize revenue when the distributor sells through such inventory to an endcustomer 

  

we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the distributor for the following reasons based on asc 60515251 revenue recognition—products—recognition—sales of products when right of return exists  

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we enter into arrangements that have rights of return that are not estimable we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributor has sold our products to an end customer 

  

approximately 20 of our distributor sales are made through small distributors based on purchase orders rather than formal distribution arrangements these distributors do not receive any stock rotation rights we do not have a history of accepting returns from these distributors 

  

the terms in a majority of our distribution agreements include the nonexclusive right to sell and the agreement to use best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in certain regions of the world and the ability to terminate the distribution agreement by either party with up to three months notice we provide a one year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under this warranty we will repair the goods provide replacements at no charge or under certain circumstances provide a refund to the customer for defective products estimated warranty returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 

  

in 2006 we signed a distribution agreement with a us distributor revenue from this distributor is recognized upon sale by the distributor to the end customer because the distributor has certain rights of return which management believes are not estimable the deferred revenue balance from this distributor as of december 31 2009 and 2008 was 09 million and 05 million respectively 

  

inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required on the contrary if market conditions are more favorable we may be able to sell inventory that was previously reserved 

  

accounting for income taxes  asc 74010 income taxes—overall prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on 

  

derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure in accordance with asc 74010 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure 

  

as of december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we had a valuation allowance of 146 million 144 million and 119 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that none of the deferred tax assets will be realized except for certain deferred tax assets related to uncertain income tax positions should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

  

contingencies  we are engaged in legal proceedings resulting from several patent infringement actions against us in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities using asc 45020252 contingencies—loss contingencies—recognition to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with asc 45020252 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations which may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations 

  

accounting for stockbased compensation we have adopted the provisions of asc 7181030 compensation—stock compensation—overall—initial measurement  under the modified 

  

prospective method asc 7181030 eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement to stock compensation awards issued to employees rather the standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period  we currently use the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of our sharebased payments the blackscholes optionpricing model is based on a number of assumptions including historical volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends if these assumptions change stockbased compensation may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past the amount of stockbased compensation that we recognize is also based on an expected forfeiture rate if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stockbased compensation costs and the actual forfeitures which become known over time we may change the forfeiture rate which could have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

  

warranty reserves   we currently provide a 12month warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods or provide replacement products at no charge to the customer for defective products we record estimated warranty costs by product which are based on historical experience over the preceding 12 months at the time we recognize product revenue reserve requirements are recorded in the period of sale and are based on an assessment of the products sold with warranty and historical warranty costs incurred as the complexity of our products increases we could experience higher warranty claims relative to sales than we have previously experienced and we may need to increase these estimated warranty reserves 

  

fair value of financial instruments we adopted the provisions of asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures—overall effective january 1 2008 this statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the three categories as follows 

  

   

   

   

we also adopted the provisions of asc 820103551 fair value measurement and disclosure—overall—subsequent measurement—determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  effective april 1 2009  this fsp provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures—overall  when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 

  

our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates fair market value based on quoted market prices shortterm and longterm investments are stated at their fair market value 

  

the face value of our holdings in auction rate securities is 374 million of which 205 million is currently classified as longterm availableforsale investments and 169 million is classified as shortterm trading investments the securities that are classified as shortterm trading securities have been classified as such because the company intends to exercise its put option to sell these securities to ubs in june of 2010 these investments are accounted for in accordance with asc 32010 investments—debt and equity securities—overall investments in availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are 

  

recognized through shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet we record an impairment charge to earnings when an availableforsale investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary investments in trading securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

  

we adopted the provisions of asc 3201035 investments—debt and equity securities—overall—subsequent measurement and asc 3201050 investments—debt and equity securities—overall—disclosure effective april 1 2009 and used the guidelines therein to determine whether the impairment is temporary or otherthan temporary otherthantemporary impairment charges exists when the entity has the intent to sell the security or it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery during the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized a credit loss of 70000 which was deemed to be otherthantemporary in other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

  

the ubs put right is accounted for in accordance with asc 8201035 fair value measurement and disclosures—overall—subsequent measurement we value the ubs put right at fair value which is estimated to be equal to the par value of the auctionrate securities less their fair value as determined by management refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

  

based on certain assumptions described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k we recorded impairment charges on our holdings in auctionrate securities the valuation of these securities is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others

the following table shows our revenue by product family amounts in thousands except percentages 

  

   

revenue revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 was 1650 million an increase of 45 million or 28 from 1605 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in revenue between these two periods resulted primarily from increased sales of our dc to dc products of 82 million as a result of an increase in demand for electronic products in the consumer and communications markets this was partially offset by a decrease in the sales of our lighting control products in the amount of 45 million as a result of the continuing shift of notebook backlighting from ccfl solutions to wled solutions sales for our audio products for the year ended december 31 2009 remained relatively flat year over year 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 was 1605 million an increase of 265 million or 198 from 1340 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase in revenue between these two periods resulted primarily from increased sales of our dc to dc converters of 287 million as a result of increased sales of consumer and communications end market devices we experienced a decrease in the sales of our lighting control products in the amount of 34 million due to a decrease in product demand particularly notebook computers the sales of our audio products increased by 12 million due to increased sales of consumer electronics products 

  

gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 592 for the year ended december 31 2009 and 619 for the year ended december 31 2008 for the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 gross margin declined yearoveryear as a result of increasing price pressure and therefore declining average selling prices and an increase in inventory reserves resulting from a decrease in the general demand for certain of our lighting control products 

  

gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin was 619 for the year ended december 31 2008 and 636 for the year ended december 31 2007 gross margin declined yearoveryear as a result of a decrease in the average selling price of certain of our mature products and an increase in inventory reserves particularly in the fourth quarter due to the deterioration in the general demand for electronic products

for a more complete description of our litigation matters please see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 10 “litigation” of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

patent litigation settlement provision reversal net 

  

   

patent litigation provision reversal net was 64 million for the year ended december 31 2009 in 2009 we completed the litigation process with respect to the lawsuit related to tse a customer the conclusion of this lawsuit resulted in recording a reversal of a patent litigation provision of approximately 74 million this provision was recorded as a patent litigation provision in the second quarter of 2007 and the reversal of this provision in this fiscal year is reflected in the patent litigation settlement and provision reversal net item in the consolidated statement of operations in connection with the completion of this lawsuit the company also jointly terminated an escrow agreement with tse and retrieved the deposit of 74 million this recovery was reduced by certain litigation stipulations for other parties involved in the case in the amount of 10 million 

  

there were no patent litigation settlements or provision reversals in 2008 in july 2007 we received an unfavorable ruling in our litigation with tse for which we recorded an accrual for a patent litigation settlement of 98 million in the second quarter of 2007 of which 25 million was paid in the third quarter of 2007 and the remainder was held in escrow 

  

lease abandonment 

  

   

we did not abandon any of our leases in 2009 and 2008 in december 2006 we abandoned our lease in los gatos and wrote off 12 million in operating expenses based on the fair value of the liability in accordance with asc 42010 exit or disposal cost obligations—overall  in may 2007 we entered into a sublease agreement to rent a portion of our los gatos facility for a period of 21 months commencing on june 1 2007 during which we were to receive gross payments of 07 million as the amount we expected to receive was greater than the amount we originally estimated we reduced the estimate of our remaining liability by 05 million in the second quarter of 2007 

  

interest and other income for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 interest and other income was 10 million 36 million and 47 million respectively despite year over year increases cash cash equivalents and investment balances interest income decreased due to significant declines in interest rates resulting from the global financial crisis 

  

other expense other expense comprised mainly of foreign exchange losses was 04 million 07 million and 01 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

income tax provision the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2009 was 05 million or 24 of the pretax income respectively this differs from the us federal statutory rate of 34 primarily because our foreign income is taxed at lower rates and because of the benefit that we realized as a result of stock options exercised and restricted units released 

  

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2008 was 12 million or 48 of our income before income taxes this was lower than the us federal statutory rate of 34 due primarily to a benefit from earnings in low foreign tax jurisdictions and a decrease in prioryear uncertain tax position reserves under asc 74010 which was partially offset by an increase in currentyear asc 74010 reserves additional asc 74010 interest accruals an increase in the valuation allowance in the us and nondeductible stock option compensation expenses 

  

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2007 was 27 million or 189 of our pretax income this differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily because we recorded an increase in the valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets in the amount of 15 million as we no longer expected that our deferred tax assets will be realized furthermore we provided a full valuation allowance against the tax benefits from the unpaid portion of the tse litigation settlement which was offset by deductions from stock option exercises and the paid portion of the tse litigation settlement in the second quarter of 2007

as of december 31 2009 we had working capital of 1796 million including cash and cash equivalents of 467 million and shortterm investments of 1189 million compared to working capital of 1174 million including cash and cash equivalents of 833 million and shortterm investments of 219 million as of december 31 2008 our working capital increased yearoveryear primarily due to cash generated from operating activities the reclassification of 169 million in auctionrate securities from longterm to shortterm investments because of the ubs put right which is an auctionrate security rights offering from ubs to sell up to 169 million in face value of eligible auctionrate securities commencing in june 2010 and proceeds from the issuance of common stock 

  

for the year ended december 31 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was 318 million primarily due to strong operating results during the year this was offset by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased shipments at the end of the quarter ended december 31 2009 for which collections had not yet been made and a decrease in accrued and longterm liabilities for the year ended december 31 2008 net cash provided by operating activities was 396 million primarily due to strong operating results for the year ended december 31 2007 net cash provided by operating activities was 261 million primarily due to strong operating results partially offset by an increase in inventory purchases in anticipation of future demand requirements 

  

for the year ended december 31 2009 net cash used in investing activities was 821 million primarily related to the purchase of shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2008 net cash used in investing activities was 296 million primarily related to the purchase of 281 million in auctionrate securities which became illiquid in february 2008 and which we have not been able to sell and the purchase of 52 million in capital equipment this was offset by the release of 86 million in restricted assets as a result of an agreement between o2micro and us relating to certain legal proceedings in taiwan for the year ended december 31 2007 net cash used by investing activities was 139 million primarily due to capital equipment purchases of 67 million in addition we placed in escrow 74 million in connection with the tse litigation for which we could have been 

  

liable subject to the outcome of certain legal activities the conclusion of this lawsuit resulted in recording a reversal of a patent litigation provision of approximately 74 million due to the release of the restricted cash in escrow in the third quarter of 2009 

  

we use professional investment management firms to manage the majority of our invested cash within the us the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds outside of the us our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in us treasury notes and other sovereign obligations and highly rated corporate notes the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes 

  

the market for auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days became illiquid in 2008 as of december 31 2009 our investment portfolio included 356 million net of impairment charges of 18 million in governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities the portfolio also included a ubs auctionrate put right which was valued at 07 million in accordance with the fair value measurement provisions of asc 8201035 during the year ended december 31 2009 auction rate securities with a face value of 13 million were sold at par through successful auctions however the remaining auction rate securities in the portfolio with a face value of approximately 374 million have failed to reset through successful auctions and it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 38 years and the underlying credit quality of these instruments in which we have invested remain generally aaa rated with 121 million of our auction rate securities having been downgraded by moody’s to aa1baa3 

  

we adopted the provisions of asc 3201035 investments—debt and equity securities—overall—subsequent measurement and asc 3201050 investments—debt and equity securities—overall—disclosure effective april 1 2009 and used the guidelines therein to determine whether the impairment is temporary or otherthan temporary temporary impairment charges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within equity and have no impact on net income otherthantemporary impairment charges exist when the entity has the intent to sell the security or it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery otherthantemporary impairment charges are recorded in other income expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 

  

in october 2008 we accepted an offer to participate in an auctionrate security rights offering from ubs to sell up to 182 million in face value amount of eligible auctionrate securities commencing in june 2010 since then 13 million of these auctionrate securities were called at par leaving 169 million in eligible auctionrate securities remaining at ubs the offer gives us the right but not the obligation to sell these securities at par to ubs and allows us to borrow up to 169 million in accepting the offer we also entered into a release of claims in favor of ubs 

  

since we accepted this put right from ubs we intend to sell these auctionrate securities at par to ubs commencing in june 2010 these securities have been reclassified as trading securities and the cumulative impairment related to these auctionrate securities was 07 million and 13 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively therefore the impairment related to these securities has been recorded in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

  

having accepted ubs’ rights offering we valued the put right at fair value which was estimated to be equal to the par value of the auctionrate securities less their fair value as determined by management the value of the put right was 07 million and 13 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the effect of which has been recorded by the company in other income in the consolidated statement of operations the ubs rights offering is being accounted for as a fairvalue instrument under asc 8201035 and as such all future changes in the fair value of these instruments will be recognized in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

  

for the remaining auctionrate securities for which the rights offering described above does not apply and which have a face value of 205 million and 206 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively management concluded that as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the cumulative impairment of 11 million and 14 million respectively was temporary based on the following analysis 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

based on the guidance of asc 3201035 and asc 3201050 the company evaluated the potential credit loss of each of the auctionrate securities for which a put right was not provided based on such analysis the company determined that those securities that are not 100 ffelps guaranteed are potentially subject to credit risks based on the extent to which the underlying debt is collateralized and the securityspecific studentloan default rates mps’ portfolio includes three such securities one of which has a senior parity ratio of approximately 115 which is substantially above the expected studentloan default rate for that security conversely the senior parity ratio for the other two securities is approximately 105 if therefore the studentloan default rate and borrowing rate increases for these issuers the remaining balance in these trusts may not be sufficient to cover the senior debt the company therefore concluded that there is potential credit risk for these two securities and as such used the discounted cash flow model to determine the amount of credit loss to be recorded in valuing the potential credit loss the following parameters were used 20 year expected term cash flows based on the 90day tbill rates for 20 year forwards and a risk premium of 59 the amount of interest that the company was receiving on these securities when the market was last active the potential credit loss associated with these securities was 70000 which the company recorded in other expense in its consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december 31 2009 

  

unless another rights offering or other similar offers are made to redeem at par and accepted by us we intend to hold the balance of these investments through successful auctions at par which we believe could take approximately 20 years 

  

the valuation of the auctionrate securities is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others to determine the fair value of the auctionrate securities at december 31 2009 september 30 2009 june 30 2009 march 31 2009 and december 31 2008 we used a discounted cash flow model 

  

for which there are three valuation parameters including timetoliquidity discount rate and expected return the following are the values used in the discounted cash flow model 

  

   

from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009 we increased the timetoliquidity from 15 years to 20 years as we did not believe that liquidity would return to the market until then we also experienced a downgrade in certain of our auctionrate securities by moody’s these changes increased the impairment of these securities however there was a decrease in the ffelpsguaranteed studentloan credit default swap spread from 325 basis points at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 to 150 basis points at the end of the first quarter of 2009 which significantly reduced the impairment of these securities as a result of offsetting charges the total cumulative impairment charge of 27 million did not change from december 31 2008 however the temporary impairment charge increased from 14 million at the end of 2008 to 15 million at the end of the first quarter of 2009 otherthantemporary impairment charges decreased from 13 million at the end of 2008 to 12 million at the end of the first quarter of 2009 

  

from the first quarter of 2009 to the second quarter of 2009 we decreased the time to liquidity from 20 years to 18 years as three months had elapsed between periods we also experienced a decrease in the ffelpsguaranteed studentloan credit default swap spread from 150 basis points at the end of the first quarter of 2009 to 80 basis points at the end of the second quarter of 2009 based on the quarterly change in the parameters used in the discounted cash flow model the total cumulative impairment charge decreased from 27 million at the end of the first quarter of 2009 to 20 million at the end of the second quarter of 2009 temporary impairment charges decreased from 15 million at the end of the first quarter of 2009 to 11 million at the end of the second quarter of 2009 we also recognized 70000 in credit losses in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations as detailed in note 8 fair value measurements 

  

from the second quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of 2009 we increased the time to liquidity from 18 years to two years even though 13 million of our holdings in auction rate securities were called at par the credit markets for these types of securities remained tight and it was unclear as to when the markets would regain its liquidity we also experienced a decrease in the ffelpsguaranteed student loan credit default swap spread from 80 basis points at the end of the second quarter of 2009 to 30 basis points at the end of the third quarter of 2009 based on the quarterly change in the parameters used in the discounted cash flow model the cumulative impairment decreased from 20 million at the end of the second quarter to 18 million at the end of the third quarter temporary impairment charges remained relatively constant between quarters however we experienced a 02 million decrease in otherthantemporary impairment charges related to the auctionrate securities held at ubs which was fully offset by the change in the value of the ubs put right 

  

from the third quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2009 we held the time to liquidity to two years the parameters used in the discounted cash flow model remained relatively constant and as such the cumulative impairment did not change from 18 million in the prior quarter 

  

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 was 136 million primarily from the issuance of common stock in the amount of 130 million and excess tax benefits from stock option transactions in the amount of 06 million 

  

net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 was 98 million primarily from the repurchase of 250 million of our common stock of which our board approved a repurchase of up to 250 million this was partially offset by the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock in the amount of 145 million and excess tax benefits related to the exercise of options of 08 million net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 200 million primarily from the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock in the amount of 173 million and excess tax benefits related to the exercise of options in the amount of 27 million 

  

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding our operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

contractual obligations 

  

we lease our headquarters and sales offices in san jose california under a noncancelable operating lease which expires in october 2016 although we relocated our headquarters from los gatos california to san jose we had a noncancelable lease on our los gatos facility which expired in february 2009 for which we signed an agreement in may 2007 to sublease a portion of the property for the remaining term in the second quarter of 2007 we reversed 05 million of the 13 million writeoff that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 as a result of the aforementioned sublease certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases in addition as described below we have a fiveyear lease arrangement which we entered into in september 2004 for our manufacturing facility located in chengdu china which will expire in march 2011 we also lease our sales offices in japan china taiwan and korea 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2007 we qualified a second source foundry and have incorporated their wafers in our production units as of december 31 2009 our total outstanding purchase commitments were 132 million which includes wafer purchases from our two foundries the purchase of assembly services primarily from multiple contractors in asia and purchase commitments related to the construction of our chengdu facility this compares to purchase commitments of 103 million as of december 31 2008 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility of approximately 02 million we also have the option to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 20 million which option becomes exercisable in march 2011 we will likely enter into a purchase agreement for this facility at the end of the lease term 

  

we are currently in the process of constructing a 140000 square foot research and development facility in chengdu china which will be operational in mid2010 and for which we have outstanding purchase commitments which are included in the table below 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years in thousands 

  

   

because of the uncertainty as to the timing of payments related to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded estimated obligations of 49 million from the table above 

  

off balance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2009 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of the securities and exchange commission’s regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

interest rate risk 

  

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities 

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale or trading for availableforsale investments no gains or losses are recognized by us in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired availableforsale investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 

  

fluctuations in interest rates of  10 could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 01 million 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes in 2009 the primary functional currency of the company’s offshore operations was the local currency primarily the new taiwan dollar and the chinese yuan to date fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations however fluctuations of  10 in such local currencies could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 26 million 

  

value change to investments 

  

as of december 31 2009 all of our holdings in auction rate securities which have a face value of 374 million have failed to reset as a result of current market conditions should these auctions 

  

continue to fail and if the credit rating for these securities decline a 10 decline in the fair value could impact our results of operations by approximately 37 million 

  

in valuing the auctionrate securities using the discounted cash flow model a change in either the liquidity risk premium or timetoliquidity by 10 would result in a 01 million change in the value of our auctionrate securities portfolio

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to us including our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

  

based on our evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at december 31 2009 and provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15df our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

  

our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a deficiency in design exists when a a control necessary to meet the control objective is missing or b an existing control is not properly 

  

designed so that even if the control operates as designed the control objective would not be met a deficiency in operation exists when a properly designed control does not operate as designed or when the person performing the control does not possess the necessary authority or competence to perform the control effectively a significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 in performing this assessment management used the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—an integrated framework based upon this assessment our management has concluded that as of december 31 2009 our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report included elsewhere herein on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  

while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance that their respective objectives will be met we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors and all fraud any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2009 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

monolithic power systems designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we combine advanced process technology with our highly experienced analog designers to produce highperformance power management integrated circuits ics for dc to dc converters led drivers cold cathode fluorescent lamp ccfl backlight controllers classd audio amplifiers and other linear ics our products are used extensively in computing and network communications products flat panel tvs set top boxes and a wide variety of consumer and portable electronics products we partner with worldclass manufacturing organizations to deliver top quality ultracompact highperformance solutions through productive costefficient channels founded in 1997 and headquartered in san jose california we have expanded our global presence with offices in taiwan china korea japan and europe which operate under mps international ltd 

  

industry overview 

  

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or as ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for ‘high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics ‘high performance’ products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish analog and mixedsignal ic markets from digital ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have however targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

products and applications 

  

we currently have three primary product families that address multiple applications within the computing consumer electronics and communications markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

  

direct current dc to dc converters dc to dc converter ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers set top boxes automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc converters are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their 

  

high degree of integration and rapid switching speeds these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices 

  

liquid crystal display lcd backlight inverters lcd backlight inverter ics are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers lcd monitors car navigational systems and lcd televisions these ics function by converting lowvoltage direct current dc or battery voltage to highvoltage alternating current ac we believe our lcd backlight inverter ics were the first to utilize a full bridge resonant topology that allows for high efficiency extended lifetimes for cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfls and lower signal interference with adjacent components the full bridge topology is now the industry standard for these products we also believe that our lcd backlight inverter ics are the semiconductor industry’s only backlight inverter ics with four fullyintegrated power devices this integration reduces the overall size total solution part count and cost for our customers our lcd product family encompasses all of the products that we formerly referred to as our ccfl product family as well as other nonccfl solutions for lcd backlight inverters 

  

audio amplifiers audio amplifier ics are used to amplify sound produced by audio processors we currently offer classd audio amplifiers which are wellsuited for applications that require both a small form factor and high power efficiency such as plasma televisions lcd televisions and dvd players with today’s systems becoming smaller and utilizing larger amounts of power solution sizes and the management of heat dissipation are becoming increasingly important to the overall system design the high degree of power efficiency and small form factor provided by our classd audio amplifiers allows system vendors to significantly reduce heat dissipation eliminating the costly and sizable fans and heat sinks traditionally required by audio amplifier ics these features enable our customers to achieve their design and cost objectives without sacrificing sound quality 

  

we currently target our products at the computing consumer electronics and communications markets with the consumer market representing the largest portion of our revenue as we continue to expand our product portfolio and addressable markets and as other end markets in which we participate continue to grow we expect our revenue from the consumer market to decline as a percentage of our total revenue over time 

  

the following is a brief summary of our product family solutions for various applications for each of these applications we are currently shipping product or have design wins which are decisions by original equipment manufacturers or oems or original design manufacturers or odms to use our ics 

  

   

we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter ic product family to the computing consumer electronics and communications markets in the future we will continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families such as high current high voltage small form factor switching voltage regulators as well as expand our newer product families in battery chargers voltage references and low dropout regulators our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of greater china expand our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

please refer to the table showing our revenue by product family in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations” 

  

customers sales and marketing 

  

we sell our products through third party distributors and directly to oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers our third party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors may distribute our products to end customers which include oems odms or electronic manufacturing service providers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and electronic manufacturing service providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers the following is a summary for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 of those customers that accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in one or more of these years 

  

   

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor shall have the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in several countries in asia these agreements may be terminated by either us or the distributor on up to three months’ notice these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

  

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china korea and japan and have marketing representatives in europe our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems electronics containing our products 

  

because our sales are billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are not directly subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because 89 of our revenue in 2008 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped our backlog at december 31 2008 was 104 million we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of our future sales order lead times may vary and as is common within our industry customers are allowed to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice our quarterly revenue is also influenced by orders booked and shipped within that quarter which are not reflected as backlog at the end of any preceding quarter our manufacturing lead times are generally 4 to 12 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in the united states china and europe with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products 

  

please refer to the discussion of the amount spent on research and development during each of the last three fiscal years in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—research and development” 

  

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of january 12 2009 we had approximately 240 patents issued and pending of which 43 have been issued in the united states our us issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through august 2026 and our other issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through december 2027 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we have entered into a patent license agreement with another integrated circuit company pursuant to which we have granted this company a license with certain limited sublicense rights under certain of our patents to make use and sell certain of this company’s own integrated circuit products for a period of two years and for which this company is obligated to pay us royalties based on sales of those products we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation with o2micro international limited “o2micro” linear technology corporation “linear” and chip advanced technology inc “cat” for a more complete description of our legal matters please read the section entitled item 3 legal proceedings and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and a supplier in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or supplier or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technology on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our integrated circuits 

  

we currently contract with two suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in malaysia and china the assembled ics are then sent for final testing at our chengdu facility prior to shipping to our customers 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and have exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility for approximately 02 million we also have the option to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 20 million which option becomes exercisable in march 2011 the facility has been fully operational since 2006 and we have benefitted from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs furthermore we are continuing to expand our product testing capabilities in our china facility and are able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations 

  

key personnel and employees 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would harm the business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2008 we employed 579 employees located in the united states taiwan china japan korea and europe 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering 

  

manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices inc fairchild semiconductor international intersil corporation linear technology maxim integrated products micrel inc microsemi corporation national semiconductor corporation o2micro international richtek technology corporation rohm co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated 

  

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive with respect to these factors particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

our business involves risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods these risks involve forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements 

  

if we are unsuccessful in any of the legal proceedings involving us and o2micro we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

  

we are engaged in legal proceedings with o2micro these proceedings involve various claims and counterclaims in the united states and taiwan alleging among other things patent infringement o2micro has also taken legal action against certain customers which we are indemnifying other new or existing customers may request similar indemnity from us because of continued legal actions between us and o2micro we are also involved in litigation with cat see the section entitled “item 3 legal proceedings” of this annual report on form 10k for more information 

  

if we or our customer are not ultimately successful in any of these proceedings or other litigation that could be brought against us or if any of the decisions in our favor are reversed on appeal we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be doubled or tripled we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products either into taiwan or in the us moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products or our products or our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized in taiwan finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

  

in july 2007 we settled our litigation with taiwan sumida electronics inc “tse” concerning our december 25 2002 indemnification agreement with tse if certain conditions are met under the settlement agreement we could be liable for additional potential payments up to a total sum of 74 million which is currently held in escrow subject to the outcome of certain legal activities 

  

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publiclydisclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and business 

  

until our legal proceedings with o2micro tse and cat are resolved we will continue to incur significant legal expenses that vary with the level of activity in each of these proceedings this level of activity is not entirely within our control as we may need to respond to legal actions by the opposing parties or scheduling decisions by the judges consequently it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be impacted 

  

our ongoing legal proceedings and the potential for additional legal proceedings have diverted financial and management resources 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation matters with o2micro linear and cat patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could adversely affect our business 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline 

  

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict 

  

our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset every 7 to 35 days has recently suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

  

the market for governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days became illiquid in 2008 as of december 31 2008 our investment portfolio included 374 million net of temporary impairment charges of 14 million in governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities as of that date 388 million the face value of our auctionrate security investments have failed to reset through successful auctions and it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 30 years and the underlying credit quality of these instruments in which we have invested remains aaa rated 

  

based on certain assumptions described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k we recorded impairment charges on these investments in 2008 the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others we experienced our first failed auction in midfebruary 2008 although we accepted an offer to participate in an auctionrate securities rights offering from ubs in october 2008 to sell up to 182 million in eligible auctionrate securities at par to ubs commencing in june 2010 if ubs does not follow through on its commitment to purchase the auctionrate securities at par or the auctions continue to fail the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be negatively impacted and the value of our investment portfolio could decline 

  

should there be further deterioration in the market for auctionrate securities or if the accounting rules for these securities change the value of our portfolio may decline which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our earnings 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

  

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors 

  

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets 

  

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease 

  

we believe that the application of our products in the computer consumer electronics and communications markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease in the fourth quarter of 2008 the semiconductor industry as a whole saw dramatic declines in overall demand which affected mps in addition as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

moreover approximately 20 of our business is based on products that are used in systems that contain ccfl ccfl tubes contain mercury which is the subject of environmental concerns particularly in europe should environmental issues impair the widespread use of our ccflbased products and should we be unable to produce replacement products based on led lighting fast enough to compensate for the loss of our ccflrelated business our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

  

in the past our revenues increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products due to increased competition reduced global electronics demand endcustomer market downturn market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and ongoing litigation we may not experience growth rates comparable to past periods which could affect our stock price and results of operations 

  

we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

  

our profitability is dependent on many factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the stock market in general often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in 

  

advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in further restatements of our financial statements 

  

due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision we have hired independent tax advisors to assist us in the calculation if we or our independent tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues we could be subject to errors which would result in us having to restate our financial statements restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations andor have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 

  

we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting related to income taxes 

  

because of the complexity of our tax structure we have had errors in our financial statements in the calculation of our tax provision that resulted in restatements of our prior year financial results although we believe that we have remediated the material weakness associated with our internal control over financial reporting related to the computation of our income tax provision we cannot be certain that any measures we have taken or may take in the future will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and that we will avoid any material weakness in the future in addition we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the calculation of our income tax provision that we have not discovered to date which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from our distribution channel and the loss of any one of these distributors or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

  

we market our products through distribution arrangements and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible for the year ended december 31 2008 sales to our two largest distributors accounted for approximately 30 of our total revenue significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply contracts 

  

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our integrated circuits or ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 

  

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

our products must meet exacting specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

  

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall further our thirdparty manufacturing processes or changes thereof or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems our standard warranty period is one year which exposes the company to significant risks of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support delays in cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

  

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

  

we currently depend on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent and are unable andor fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

  

we have a supply arrangement with two suppliers for the production of wafers should any of our suppliers become insolvent we many not be able to fulfill our customer orders which would likely cause a decline in our revenue currently the majority of wafer foundries in the semiconductor industry are operating well below normal capacity including the two suppliers to mps and consequently our suppliers’ ability to meet their financial obligations may become impaired 

  

while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may decline 

  

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice under our agreement with our suppliers we have an option to order wafers based on a committed forecast that can cover a period of one to six months if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

  

all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors we do not have any longterm agreements with these subcontractors as a result we may not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products in addition the current global economic crisis may materially impact our assembly supplier’s ability to operate any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

  

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct or indirect sales through distribution arrangements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2008 approximately 89 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the price and availability of commodities eg gold platinum copper and silicon may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and costeffective manner and may affect our business and results of operations 

  

our products incorporate commodities such as gold platinum copper and silicon the price and availability of these commodities and other like commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

devaluation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the chinese yuan may adversely affect results of operations 

  

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future should the value of the chinese yuan continue to rise against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition because we collect payments from all customers in us dollars fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could have an adverse impact on our customers’ business which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

  

most of our manufacturing partners are located in china in addition we have established a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facility in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our testing facility in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

  

we have a testing facility in china that began operations in 2006 in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this quarterly report we face the following risks among others 

  

   

   

if we are unable to continue a fully operational status with appropriate controls we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses 

  

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

  

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future which could harm our revenues and gross profits 

  

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our margins 

  

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

  

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from a third party manufacturer in advance of selling our product we place orders with our manufacturer based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturer in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the time frame that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigations or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be disposed of if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position 

  

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

  

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures must be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process which averages six to twelve months requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional three to six months after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and 

  

based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

  

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands or our business including design cycles our business could be harmed 

  

if we fail to retain key employees in sales applications finance and legal or to make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

  

since 2006 we significantly increased the quantity and quality of our sales applications financial and legal staff however if we fail to continue to adequately staff these areas maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal controls that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

  

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

  

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships or acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities and we may be unable to successfully integrate these companies into our operations which would adversely affect our business 

  

as a part of our business strategy from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other competitive 

  

opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership andor incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities such actions by us could impact our operating results andor the price of our common stock in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business 

  

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financing and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our competitors to include but not be limited to analog devices fairchild semiconductor intersil linear maxim integrated products micrel microsemi national semiconductor o2micro richtech semtech stmicroelectronic and texas instruments we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market 

  

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

  

if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

because of their significant stock ownership our officers and directors will be able to exert significant influence over our future direction 

  

executive officers directors and affiliated entities beneficially owned in aggregate approximately 15 of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2008 these stockholders if acting together would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

  

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer supplier our ic testing facility a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

our facilities in chengdu china are located in a seismically active area as evidenced by the may 2008 earthquake that was centered in the sichuan province of china although there was no damage to our facilities as a result of that earthquake should there be additional earthquakes or aftershocks in the area we may incur losses and our business financial condition andor operating results may suffer

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

o2micro inc 

  

since november 2000 we have been engaged in multiple legal proceedings involving patent infringement claims with o2micro inc and its parent corporation o2micro international limited referred to hereinafter as “o2micro” all of these claims relate to our ccfl backlight inverter products for further information regarding the history of these legal proceedings refer to our previous filings on forms 10k and related amendments 10q and 8k 

  

in the united states district court for the northern district of california o2micro alleged that certain of our ccfl products infringe o2micro’s ‘722 patent on october 30 2007 following the jury’s verdict the court entered judgment that all of the ‘722 patent claims asserted by o2micro against us are invalid and denied all posttrial motions subsequently o2micro filed an appeal and we filed a crossappeal with the federal circuit the appeals are currently pending 

  

on may 1 2007 we filed for declaratory judgment relief in the united states district court for the northern district of california against o2micro that certain of our ccfl products do not infringe o2micro’s ‘129 patent and that the ‘129 patent is invalid and unenforceable on august 20 2008 the parties filed a joint stipulation to a dismissal with prejudice of their respective claims for relief in which o2micro covenants not to assert or reassert its ‘129 patent against us or our direct and indirect customers for infringement by our series of power inverter controller products 

  

on september 30 2008 based on information and belief that o2micro had alleged to a customer that certain of our inverter controller products infringe o2micro’s patents we filed for declaratory judgment relief in the united states district court for the northern district of california against o2micro that those products do not infringe o2micro’s 6856519 ‘519 patent family on february 11 2009 o2micro filed a counterclaim against us and our customers that certain of our inverter controller products infringe three patents in the ‘519 patent family and o2micro’s 7417382 ‘382 patent 

  

on december 15 2008 o2micro filed a complaint with the international trade commission alleging the patent infringement of the ‘519 and ‘382 patents against certain of our products this case is still in the early proceedings 

  

in addition to the us litigation described above o2micro has brought various legal proceedings against us in taiwan based upon a taiwan patent we previously posted cash bonds of approximately 79 million with the taiwan courts in support of our counterinjunctions and to prevent o2 from seizing our assets in july 2008 the parties agreed to cease all provisional remedial disputes against each other and allow the parties to retrieve the bonds posted as a result of the agreement we retrieved the bonds totaling approximately 79 million in the second half of 2008 

  

taiwan sumida electronics 

  

on july 30 2007 we settled our litigation with tse concerning the indemnification agreement as of december 31 2008 we had 74 million held in escrow for which we could be liable subject to the outcome of certain legal activities which are still pending in front of the federal circuit court of appeal 

  

linear technology corporation 

  

on july 1 2008 the united states district court for the district of delaware issued a judgment as a matter of law that we did not breach its october 1 2005 settlement and license agreement with linear we plan to seek recovery of our attorney fees and costs from linear pursuant to a prevailing party attorneys’ fees provision in the settlement and license agreement however there can be no assurance that we can be successful in obtaining such recovery 

  

the court also found as a matter of law that we did not willfully infringe the patent claims of us patent numbers 5481178 and 6580258 asserted by linear against mps’ accused mp1543 product which has been discontinued however the jury returned a verdict that an evaluation board containing the previously discontinued mp1543 product had directly infringed the asserted patent claims and that linear’s patents mentioned above are valid the parties had stipulated to a total of ten dollars in nominal patent infringement damages in the event that linear prevailed in that dispute the court has not issued a final judgment concerning the patent infringement and validity claims 

  

chip advanced technology inc 

  

on december 12 2007 we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the us district court for the central district of california against chip advanced technology inc “cat” asserting that cat 

  

willfully infringed a mps patent that enables efficient low voltage low current power conversions such as dcdc step down converters in the complaint mps seeks unspecified damages and a courtordered injunction against future infringement by cat on september 16 2008 we amended our complaint to add trade secret misappropriation claims against cat through this lawsuit mps intends to vigorously protect and enforce its intellectual property as the case is in its early stages we are not able to determine the outcome of the litigation

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report on form 10k 

  

overview 

  

we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we currently offer products that serve multiple markets including notebook computers flat panel televisions wireless communications telecommunications equipment general consumer products cellular handsets and set top boxes among others we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to continue to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as in new product categories 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term 

  

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths 

  

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes six to twelve months to achieve revenue volume production is usually achieved in three to six months after we receive an initial customer order for a new product typical lead times for orders are fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult 

  

we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements or direct sales to customers in asia where the components we produce are incorporated into an enduser product 89 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 and 90 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which services the computing consumer electronics and communications markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation longterm investments inventories income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our 

  

control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates under different estimates assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” issued by the staff of the sec sab 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in our generally recognizing revenue upon shipment when title passes to customers should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 

  

more than 90 of our distributor sales are made through distribution arrangements with third parties these arrangements do not include any special payment terms our normal payment terms are 3045 days price protection or exchange rights returns are limited to our standard product warranty certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases in return for a compensating new order of equal or greater dollar value we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per distributor basis and information related to products in the distribution channel this reserve is recorded at the time of sale in the future if we are unable to estimate our stock rotation returns accurately we may not be able to recognize revenue from sales to our distributors based on when we sell inventory to our distributors rather than when the distributor sells through such inventory to an endcustomer 

  

we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the distributor for the following reasons based on paragraph 6 of sfas 48 revenue recognition when right of return exists  

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we enter into arrangements that have rights of return that are not estimable we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributor has sold our products to an end customer 

  

less than 10 of our distributor sales are made through small distributors based on purchase orders rather than formal distribution arrangements these distributors do not receive any stock rotation rights and as such hold very little inventory if any we do not have a history of accepting returns from these distributors 

  

the terms in a majority of our distribution agreements include the nonexclusive right to sell and the agreement to use best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in certain regions of the world and the ability to terminate the distribution agreement by either party with up to three months notice we provide a one year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under this warranty we will repair the goods provide replacements at no charge or under certain circumstances provide a refund to the customer for defective products estimated warranty returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 

  

in 2006 we signed a distribution agreement with a us distributor revenue from this distributor is recognized upon sale by the distributor to the end customer because the distributor has certain rights of return which management believes are not estimable for the year ended december 31 2008 and 2007 the deferred revenue balance from this distributor was 05 million and 03 million respectively 

  

inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

  

accounting for income taxes fasb interpretation no 48 “fin 48” accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition we adopted the provisions of this interpretation on january 1 2007 in accordance with sfas no 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made due to the adoption of fin 48 effective january 1 2007 we calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure 

  

as of december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we had a valuation allowance of 144 million 119 million and 46 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that none of the deferred tax assets will be realized except for certain deferred tax assets related to uncertain income tax positions should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

  

contingencies we are engaged in legal proceedings resulting from several patent infringement actions against us in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities using sfas no 5 “ accounting for contingencies ” to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas 5 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations which may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations 

  

accounting for stockbased compensation effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment  under the modified prospective method sfas 123r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of accounting principles board “apb” opinion 25 to stock compensation awards issued to employees rather the standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period  we currently use the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of our sharebased payments the blackscholes optionpricing model is based on a number of assumptions including expected volatility for which we use the average volatility of a number of our competitors and combine them with our limited historical volatility to come up with an overall volatility that is used in the model the blackscholes option pricing model also includes an assumption of expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends if these assumptions change stockbased compensation may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past the amount of stockbased compensation that we recognize is also based on an expected forfeiture rate if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stockbased compensation costs and the actual forfeitures which become known over time we may change the forfeiture rate which could have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

  

warranty reserves   we currently provide a 12month warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods or provide replacement products at no charge to the customer for defective products we record estimated warranty costs by product which are based on historical experience over the preceding 12 months by product at the time we recognize product revenue reserve requirements are recorded in the period of sale and are based on an assessment of 

  

the products sold with warranty and historical warranty costs incurred as the complexity of our products increases we could experience higher warranty claims relative to sales than we have previously experienced and we may need to increase these estimated warranty reserves

results of operations 

  

the table below shows the statement of operations amounts in thousands and shows each as a percentage of revenue 

  

   

the following table shows our revenue by product family amounts in thousands except percentages 

  

   

revenue revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 was 1605 million an increase of 265 million or 198 from 1340 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase in revenue between these two periods resulted primarily from increased sales of our dc to dc converters of 287 million as a result of increased sales of consumer and communications end market devices we experienced a decrease in the sales of our lcd backlight inverters in the amount of 34 million due to a decrease in demand particularly notebook computers the sales of our audio products increased by 12 million due to increased sales of consumer electronics products 

  

although we experienced revenue growth of 198 yearoveryear as we continue to deliver innovative products our business in the fourth quarter was and will continue to be affected by the deterioration in the general demand for electronic products as a result of the worldwide financial crisis and associated macroeconomic slowdown currently we cannot estimate the magnitude and extent to which our business will be affected in the future 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 was 1340 million an increase of 290 million or 276 from 1050 million for year ended december 31 2006 the increase in revenue between the two periods resulted from increased sales of our dc to dc converters of 150 million lcd backlight inverter products of 65 million and audio products of 75 million for the year ended december 31 2007 despite a decline in our average sales price for certain of our units revenue from our dc to dc converters increased 209 due to increased sales of flat panel tvs and other consumer devices revenue for our ccfl products which are a part of our lcd backlight inverter family increased 223 due to strength in the notebook market over the same period in 2006 however given the uncertainty of the outcome of our litigation with o2micro we cannot predict the impact that such litigation will have on such revenue in the future revenue for our audio amplifier product family increased by 1828 primarily due to increased demand for new and existing products used in consumer electronic applications 

  

gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin was 619 for the year ended december 31 2008 and 636 for the year ended december 31 2007 gross margin declined yearoveryear as a result of a decrease in the average selling price of certain of our mature products and an increase in inventory reserves particularly in the fourth quarter due to the deterioration in the general demand for electronic products 

  

gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin was 636 for year ended december 31 2007 and 637 for the year ended december 31 2006 our gross margin remained relatively flat year over year there was a decline in our average sales prices for certain of our products which was offset by a shift in product mix and certain production efficiencies at our chengdu facility 

  

research and development research and development rd expenses consist of salary and benefit expenses for design and product engineers expenses related to new product development and related facility costs 

  

   

rd expenses were 349 million or 217 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 and 273 million or 204 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 the yearoveryear increase in rd expenses was primarily due to an increase in rd headcount new product development activities additional employee bonus payments and patentrelated activities the yearoveryear increase was also due to an increase in stockbased compensation expenses of 12 million 

  

rd expenses were 273 million or 204 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 and 223 million or 212 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in rd 

  

expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 was due to increased bonus expenses for rd personnel costs associated with an increase in headcount for design engineering personnel as well as new product development activities primarily in the dc to dc product line both in the us and asia rd expenses also increased because of patent related activities 

  

selling general and administrative selling general and administrative sga expenses include salary and benefit expenses sales commissions travel expenses related facilities costs outside legal and accounting fees and fees associated with sarbanesoxley compliance requirements 

  

   

sga expenses were 353 million or 220 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 and 295 million or 220 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 sga expenses increased yearoveryear due to an increase in headcount to support the growth in business sales commissions sales representative contractual obligations and bonus expenses the yearoveryear increase was also due to an increase in stockbased compensation expenses in the amount of 09 million 

  

sga expenses were 295 million or 220 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 and 276 million or 263 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 sga expenses increased for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily due to an increase in commissions due to increased revenue and increased personnel and related benefits to support the growing business 

  

patent litigation settlement 

  

   

there were no legal settlements in 2008 in july 2007 we received an unfavorable ruling in our litigation with tse for which we recorded an accrual for legal settlement of 98 million in the second quarter of 2007 of which 25 million was paid in the third quarter of 2007 and the remainder is held in escrow during the year ended december 31 2006 we settled our litigation with micrel in the amount of 30 million 

  

provision for litigation 

  

   

provision for litigation expenses which represents legal expenses for ongoing litigation were 67 million or 42 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 94 million excluding settlement expenses of 98 million or 70 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 we incurred significant legal expenses during the first six months of 2008 for our lawsuit with linear technology for the year ended december 31 2007 we incurred significant legal expenses to prepare for and try our cases against o2micro and tse for a more complete description of our litigation matters please see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 10 “litigation” of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

provision for litigation excluding settlement expenses of 98 million in 2007 and 30 million in 2006 was 94 million or 70 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 116 million or 110 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 the year over year sequential decrease in the provision for litigation from 2007 to 2006 was due to reduced litigation expenses as a result of the settlement and preliminary resolution of certain lawsuits over the periods 

  

lease abandonment 

  

   

there were no lease abandonments in 2008 in december 2006 we abandoned our lease in los gatos and wrote off 12 million in operating expenses based on the fair value of the liability in accordance with sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  in may 2007 we entered into a sublease agreement to rent a portion of our los gatos facility for a period of 21 months commencing on june 1 2007 during which we are to receive gross payments of 07 million as the amount we expect to receive is greater than the amount we originally estimated we reduced the estimate of our remaining liability by 05 million in the second quarter of 2007 

  

interest and other income interest and other income was 36 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and 47 million for the year ended december 31 2007 despite higher cash cash equivalent and investment balances in 2008 interest income decreased yearoveryear due to a significant decline in interest rates in 2008 resulting from the global credit crisis 

  

interest and other income was 47 million and 26 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively interest and other income increased due to higher yields and higher cash cash equivalent and shortterm investment balances and was comprised primarily of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

  

  

other expense other expense comprised mainly of foreign exchange losses from the sale of a bond held in taiwan in connection with a litigation settlement was 07 million for the year ended 2008 

  

income tax provision the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2008 was 12 million or 48 of our income before income taxes this differs from the federal statutory rate of 34 due primarily to a benefit from earnings in low foreign tax jurisdictions and a decrease in prioryear fin 48 reserves which is partially offset by an increase in currentyear fin 48 reserves additional fin 48 interest accruals an increase in valuation allowance in the us and nondeductible stock option compensation expenses the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2007 was 27 million or 189 of our pretax income this differs from the federal statutory rate of 34 primarily because we recorded an increase in the valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets in the amount of 15 million as we no longer expect that our deferred tax assets will be realized furthermore we provided a full valuation allowance against the tax benefits from the unpaid portion of the tse litigation settlement which was offset by deductions from stock option exercises and the paid portion of the tse litigation settlement in the second quarter of 2007 

  

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2006 was 60 million or 1674 of the pretax income this differs from the federal statutory rate of 34 primarily for the following reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

for additional information see note 8 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

cumulative effect of applying sab 108 in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 sab 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements in connection with the adoption of sab 108 effective january 1 2006 we corrected our financial statements for the cumulative effect of certain prior period errors by decreasing accumulated deficit and accounts payable as of the sab 108 adoption date by 033 million these errors had resulted from the duplicate recording of certain inventory costs in 2003 2004 and 2005 in addition an error resulting from unrecorded stock grants in 2000 and 2001 was corrected by increasing accumulated deficit and common stock as of the sab 108 adoption date by 027 million we used our historical method for evaluating materiality prior to the adoption of sab 108 and determined that these errors were not material to the financial statements for any of the prior periods 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2008 we had working capital of 1174 million including cash and cash equivalents of 833 million and shortterm investments of 219 million compared to working capital of 1193 million including cash and cash equivalents of 831 million and shortterm investments of 278 million as of december 31 2007 our working capital decreased slightly yearoveryear with the 

  

reclassification of 374 million in auctionrate securities from shortterm to longterm investments and 250 million in cash used to repurchase our stock diminishing working capital and proceeds from the issuance of common stock the exercise of stock options and cash generated from operating activities contributing to working capital 

  

for the year ended december 31 2008 net cash provided by operating activities was 396 million primarily due to strong sales and net income in 2008 for the year ended december 31 2007 net cash provided by operating activities was 261 million primarily due to increased sales partially offset by an increase in inventory purchases in anticipation of future demand requirements for the year ended december 31 2006 net cash provided by operating activities was 138 million primarily from increased revenues and related margin contributions 

  

for the year ended december 31 2008 net cash used in investing activities was 296 million primarily related to the purchase of 281 million in auctionrate securities which became illiquid in february 2008 and for which we have not been able to sell and the purchase of 52 million in capital equipment this was offset by the release of 86 million in restricted assets as a result of an agreement between o2micro and us relating to certain legal proceedings in taiwan for the year ended december 31 2007 net cash used by investing activities was 139 million primarily due to capital equipment purchases of 67 million in addition we placed in escrow 74 million in connection with the tse litigation for which we could be liable subject to the outcome of certain legal activities for the year ended december 31 2006 net cash generated from investing activities was 48 million primarily due to net proceeds from our investments in the amount of 111 million these amounts were offset by capital purchases of 75 million primarily related to equipment purchases for our facility in chengdu and the ramping up of our research and development activities 

  

we use professional investment management firms to manage the majority of our invested cash within the us the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds outside of the us our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in us treasury notes and other sovereign obligations and highly rated corporate notes the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes 

  

the market for governmentback student loan auctionrate securities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days became illiquid in 2008 as of december 31 2008 our investment portfolio included 361 million net of impairment charges of 27 million in governmentbacked student loan auctionrate securities which we classified as longterm investments the portfolio also included a ubs auctionrate rights offering which was valued at 13 million in accordance with the fair value measurement provisions of sfas 159 as of december 31 2008 388 million the face value of our auctionrate security investments have failed to reset through successful auctions and it is unclear as to when these investments will regain their liquidity the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 30 years and the underlying credit quality of these instruments in which we have invested remains aaa rated 

  

we used the guidelines set forth in fasb statement no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities to determine whether the impairment is temporary or otherthan temporary temporary impairment charges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within equity and have no impact on net income otherthantemporary impairment charges are recorded in other income expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 

  

in october 2008 we accepted an offer to participate in an auctionrate security rights offering from ubs to sell up to 182 million in the face amount of eligible auctionrate securities commencing in june 2010 the offer gives us the right but not the obligation to sell these securities at par to ubs and will allow us to borrow up to 182 million beginning october 7 2008 in accepting the offer we also entered into a release of claims in favor of ubs 

  

since we accepted this put right from ubs we intend to sell these securities at par to ubs commencing in june 2010 and therefore do not possess the intent to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value the impairment related to these securities of 13 million was therefore considered to be otherthantemporary and charged to the consolidated statement of operations during the quarter ended december 31 2008 

  

having accepted ubs’ rights offering we valued the put right at fair value estimated to be equal to the par value of the auctionrate securities less their fair value as determined by management the value of the put right was 13 million which we recorded in other income in the consolidated statement of operations the ubs rights offering is being accounted for as a fairvalue instrument under sfas no 159 and as such all future changes in the fair value of these instruments will be recognized in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

  

for the remaining auctionrate securities for which the rights offering described above does not apply and which have a face value of 206 million management concluded that as of december 31 2008 the impairment was temporary based on the following analysis 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

unless another rights offering or other similar offers are made to and accepted by us on terms that we deem favorable we intend to hold the balance of these investments through successful auctions at par which we believe could take approximately 15 years 

  

the valuation of the auctionrate securities is subject to fluctuations in the future which will depend on many factors including the collateral quality potential to be called or restructured underlying final maturity insurance guaranty liquidity and market conditions among others to determine the fair value of the auctionrate securities at december 31 2008 we used a discounted cash flow model for which there are three valuation parameters including timetoliquidity discount rate and expected return over the past year the parameters changed as follows 

  

   

in both the third and fourth quarters of 2008 we assumed a constant timetoliquidity of 18 months the treasury rate decreased significantly from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2008 which in turn decreased the expected return cash flows libor also decreased from the third quarter 

  

to the fourth quarter of 2008 but the studentloan credit default swaps spread widened significantly the net impact was an increase in the total impairment charge from 20 million as of september 30 2008 to 27 million as of december 31 2008 of which 14 million was recorded as temporary and the remaining 13 million was recorded as otherthantemporary 

  

net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 was 98 million primarily from the repurchase of 250 million of our common stock of which our board approved a repurchase of up to 250 million this was partially offset by the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock in the amount of 145 million and excess tax benefits related to the exercise of options of 08 million net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 200 million primarily from the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock in the amount of 173 million and excess tax benefits related to the exercise of options in the amount of 27 million net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 72 million primarily from the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock in the amount of 53 million excess tax benefits related to the exercise of options in the amount of 14 million and the repayment of a stockholder note in the amount of 04 million 

  

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding our operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 

  

we lease our headquarters and sales offices in san jose california under a noncancelable operating lease which expires in october 2016 although we relocated our headquarters from los gatos california to san jose we have a noncancelable lease on our los gatos facility which expired in february 2009 for which we signed an agreement in may 2007 to sublease a portion of the property for the remaining term in the second quarter of 2007 we reversed 05 million of the 13 million writeoff that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 as a result of the aforementioned sublease certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases in addition as described below we have a fiveyear lease arrangement which we entered into in september 2004 for our manufacturing facility located in chengdu china we also lease our sales offices in japan china taiwan and korea 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2007 we qualified a second source foundry and have incorporated their wafers in our production units as of december 31 2008 our total outstanding purchase commitments were 103 million which includes wafer purchases from our two foundries and the purchase of assembly services primarily from multiple contractors in asia this compares to purchase commitments of 91 million as of december 31 2007 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility of approximately 02 million we also have the option to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 20 million 

  

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years in thousands 

  

   

because of the uncertainty as to the timing of payments related to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded estimated obligations of 48 million from the table above 

  

off balance sheet arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2008 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of the securities and exchange commission’s regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

interest rate risk 

  

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities 

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale or trading and no gains or losses are recognized by us in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired availableforsale investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains being included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 

  

fluctuations in interest rates of  10 could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 03 million 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes in 2008 the primary functional currency of the company’s offshore operations was the local currency primarily the new taiwan dollar and the chinese yuan to date fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations however fluctuations in the currency of  10 in such local currencies could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 17 million 

  

value change to investments 

  

as of february 28 2009 all of our holdings in auction rate securities which have a face value of 388 million have failed to reset as a result of current market conditions should these auctions 

  

continue to fail and if the credit rating for these securities decline a 10 decline in the par value could impact our results of operations by approximately 39 million 

  

in valuing the auctionrate securities using the discounted cash flow model a change in the risk premium and timetomaturity by 10 would result in a change in the value of our auctionrate securities portfolio by 01 million and 02 million respectively

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend   

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to us including our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

  

based on our evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at december 31 2008 and provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15df our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

  

our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a deficiency in design exists when a a control necessary to meet the control objective is missing or b an existing control is not properly 

  

designed so that even if the control operates as designed the control objective would not be met a deficiency in operation exists when a properly designed control does not operate as designed or when the person performing the control does not possess the necessary authority or competence to perform the control effectively a significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 in performing this assessment management used the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—an integrated framework based upon this assessment our management has concluded that as of december 31 2008 our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report included elsewhere herein on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  

while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance that their respective objectives will be met we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors and all fraud any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2008 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

industry overview 

  

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or as ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for ‘high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics ‘high performance’ products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish analog and mixedsignal ic markets from digital ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have however targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

products and applications 

  

we currently have three primary product families that address multiple applications within the computing consumer electronics and communications markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

  

direct current dc to dc converters dc to dc converter ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points computers automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc converters are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of 

  

integration and rapid switching speeds these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components a smaller form factor more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system cost and increased reliability through the elimination of many discrete components and power devices 

  

light emitting diode led driver ics are also included in our dc to dc product family led driver ics are used in lighting displays in small portable devices such as color cellular handsets personal digital assistants global positioning systems and electronic gaming systems and in applications such as traffic lights and automobile signal lights 

  

liquid crystal display lcd backlight inverters lcd backlight inverter ics are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers lcd monitors car navigational systems and lcd televisions these ics function by converting lowvoltage direct current dc or battery voltage to highvoltage alternating current ac we believe our lcd backlight inverter ics were the first to utilize a full bridge resonant topology that allows for high efficiency extended lifetimes for cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfls and lower signal interference with adjacent components the full bridge topology is now the industry standard for these products we also believe that our lcd backlight inverter ics are the semiconductor industry’s only backlight inverter ics with four fullyintegrated power devices this integration reduces the overall size total solution part count and cost for our customers our lcd product family encompasses all of the products that we formerly referred to as our ccfl product family as well as other nonccfl solutions for lcd backlight inverters 

  

audio amplifiers audio amplifier ics are used to amplify sound produced by audio processors we currently offer classd audio amplifiers which are wellsuited for applications that require both a small form factor and high power efficiency such as plasma televisions lcd televisions and dvd players with today’s systems becoming smaller and utilizing larger amounts of power solution sizes and the management of heat dissipation are becoming increasingly important to the overall system design the high degree of power efficiency and small form factor provided by our classd audio amplifiers allows system vendors to significantly reduce heat dissipation eliminating the costly and sizable fans and heat sinks traditionally required by audio amplifier ics these features enable our customers to achieve their design and cost objectives without sacrificing sound quality 

  

we currently target our products at the computing consumer electronics and communications markets with the consumer market representing the largest portion of our revenue as we continue to expand our product portfolio and addressable markets and as other end markets in which we participate continue to grow we expect our revenue from the computing market to decline as a percentage of our total revenue over time 

  

the following is a brief summary of our product family solutions for various applications for each of these applications we are currently shipping product or have design wins which are decisions by original equipment manufacturers or oems or original design manufacturers or odms to use our ics 

  

   

we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter ic product family to the computing consumer electronics and communications markets in the future we expect to introduce additional new products within our existing product families such as high current high voltage small form factor switching voltage regulators battery chargers voltage references and low dropout regulators our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share grow in regions outside of greater china expand our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

please refer to the table showing our revenue by product family in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—revenue” 

  

customers sales and marketing 

  

we sell our products through third party distributors and directly to oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers our third party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with mps which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors may distribute our products to end customers which include oems odms or electronic manufacturing service providers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and electronic manufacturing service providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers the following is a summary for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 of those customers that accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in one or more of these years 

  

  

   

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor shall have the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in several countries in asia these agreements may be terminated by either us or the distributor on up to three months’ notice these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

  

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china korea and japan and have marketing representatives in europe our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems electronics containing our products 

  

because our sales are billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are not directly subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because 90 of our revenue in 2007 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped our backlog at december 31 2007 was 181 million we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future sales order lead times may vary and as is common within our industry customers are allowed to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice our quarterly revenue is also influenced by orders booked and shipped within that quarter which are not reflected as backlog at the end of any preceding quarter our manufacturing lead times are generally 4 to 12 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we will not be immune from future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers in the united states china and europe with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products 

  

we introduced a series of fully synchronous stepdown switch mode dc to dc power converters in the 2a4a current range this family of product is optimized for lowvoltage distributed power and pointofload applications in broadband communications equipment digital entertainment systems and portable electronics such as portable gps navigation graphics cards for notebook pcs and digital video cameras these applications require high efficiency to save battery power and a small footprint solution to meet the demand for a smaller higher performance end product 

  

please refer to the discussion of the amount spent on research and development during each of the last three fiscal years in the section entitled “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—research and development” 

  

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of february 28 2008 we had approximately 200 patents issued and pending of which 27 have been issued in the united states our us issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through august 2025 and our other issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through october 2025 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we have entered into a patent license agreement with another integrated circuit company pursuant to which we have granted this company a license with certain limited sublicense rights under certain of our patents to make use and sell certain of this company’s own integrated circuit products for a period of two years and for which this company is obligated to pay us royalties based on sales of those products we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation with o2 micro international limited “o2” linear technology corporation “linear” and chip advanced technology inc “cat” for a more complete description of our legal matters please read item 3 legal proceedings and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers 

  

and a supplier in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or supplier or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technology on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our integrated circuits 

  

we currently contract with two suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in malaysia and china the assembled ics are then sent for final testing at our chengdu facility prior to shipping to our customers 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and have exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility for approximately 02 million we also have the option to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 21 million the facility is fully operational and we have already experienced a reduction in costs due to significantly shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower labor and overhead costs in 2007 we expanded our product testing capabilities in our china facility and took advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and engineering operations 

  

key personnel and employees 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would harm the business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2007 we employed 500 employees located in the united states taiwan china japan korea and europe 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices inc fairchild semiconductor international intersil corporation linear technology maxim integrated products micrel inc microsemi corporation national semiconductor corporation o2 micro international richtech co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated 

  

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive with respect to these factors particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

our business involves risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 

  

if we are unsuccessful in any of the legal proceedings involving us and o2 micro or linear technology we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

  

we are engaged in legal proceedings with o2 and linear these proceedings involve various claims and counterclaims in the united states and taiwan alleging among other things patent infringement and breach of contract o2 has also taken legal action against one of our customers of our products in taiwan which we are indemnifying and against one of our suppliers we are also involved in litigation with cat see the legal proceedings section item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for more information 

  

if we or our customer are not ultimately successful in any of these proceedings or other litigation that could be brought against us or if any of the decisions in our favor are reversed on appeal we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement damages could be doubled or tripled we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products either into taiwan or in the us moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products our wafer manufacturer could decide to reduce or eliminate its manufacturing of some of our products or our products or our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized in taiwan finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

  

in july 2007 we settled our litigation with taiwan sumida electronics inc “tse” concerning our december 25 2002 indemnification agreement with tse if certain conditions are met under the settlement agreement we could be liable for additional potential payments up to a total sum of 74 million subject to the outcome of certain legal activities which amount does not include approximately 25 million that we paid tse as an upfront payment 

  

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publiclydisclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and business 

  

until our legal proceedings with o2 linear and cat are resolved we will continue to incur significant legal expenses that vary with the level of activity in each of these proceedings this level of activity is not entirely within our control as we may need to respond to legal actions by the opposing parties or scheduling decisions by the judges consequently it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be impacted 

  

our ongoing legal proceedings and the potential for additional legal proceedings have diverted financial and management resources 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation matters with o2 linear and cat patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could adversely affect our business 

  

the market for auction rate securities which are generally issued by municipalities with interest rates that reset every 7 to 35 days has recently suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio 

  

the market for auctionrate securities which are generally issued by municipalities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days has recently become illiquid as of march 7 2008 our investment portfolio included 397 million in auction rate securities backed by municipal bonds and governmentbacked student loans as of this date 22 of the auctionrate securities in our portfolio totaling 360 million have failed to reset through successful auction the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 30 years and the underlying credit quality of these instruments in which we have invested has not been downgraded and remains aaa rated it is uncertain as to when these investments will regain their liquidity and our management is in the process of assessing the value of these securities while it is too early to quantify the impact if this situation continues the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be negatively impacted and the potential value of our investment portfolio could decline and we may need to record an impairment on these assets in addition we may be required to reclassify our auctionrate securities as longterm investments rather than shortterm investments which could require us to waive certain conditions within our investment policy 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

  

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors 

  

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets 

  

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease 

  

we believe that the application of our products in the computer consumer electronics and communications markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease for example as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

moreover approximately 27 of our business is based on products that are used in systems that contain cold cathode fluorescent lighting ccfl ccfl tubes contain mercury which is the subject of environmental concerns particularly in europe should environmental issues impair the widespread use of our ccflbased products and should we be unable to produce replacement products based on led lighting fast enough to compensate for the loss of our ccflrelated business our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

we may not experience growth rates comparable to past years 

  

in the past our revenues increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products due to increased competition market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and ongoing litigation we may not experience growth rates comparable to past periods which could affect our stock price and results of operations 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline 

  

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 

  

we have a history of losses and we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

  

our accumulated deficit was 92 million as of december 31 2007 our profitability is dependent on many factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future unfavorable changes in any of the factors noted above may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability 

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our 

  

products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from our distribution channel and the loss of any one of these distributors or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

  

we market our products through distribution arrangements and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers receivables from our customers are not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible for the year ended december 31 2007 sales to our two largest distributors accounted for 34 of our total revenue significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply contracts 

  

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor odms to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 

  

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

our products must meet exacting specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

  

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems in 2005 we extended our standard warranty period from 90 days to one year as a result we now have an increased risk of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support delays in cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

  

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

  

we currently depend on two thirdparty suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products if our wafer suppliers fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders 

  

we have a supply arrangement with two suppliers for the production of wafers although certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual many important aspects of these relationships depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management relationships in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce the yields the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if our suppliers extend lead times limit supplies or the types of capacity we require or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may decline 

  

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice under our agreement with our suppliers we have an option to order wafers based on a committed forecast that can cover a period of one to six months if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

o2 sued asmc one of our suppliers for patent infringement because asmc manufactures our products it is possible that our relationship with asmc or any other supplier could be materially and adversely affected by the o2 litigation 

  

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

  

all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors we do not have any longterm agreements with these subcontractors as a result we may not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

  

we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct or indirect sales through distribution arrangements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations for the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 90 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

devaluation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the chinese yuan may adversely affect results of operations 

  

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will be substantially located in china should the value of the chinese yuan continue to rise against the us dollar there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition because we collect payments from all customers in us dollars fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could have an adverse impact on our customers’ business which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and may receive the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that include conditions or may be reduced or eliminated any of which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

  

most of our manufacturing partners are located in china in addition we have established a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to the facility we are establishing in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our testing facility in china which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments 

  

we have a testing facility in china that began operations in 2006 in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this annual report we face the following risks among others 

  

   

   

if we are unable to continue a fully operational status with appropriate controls we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses 

  

because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately 

  

forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

  

the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future which could harm our revenues and gross profits 

  

average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits or increasing our sales volumes additionally because we do not operate our own manufacturing or assembly facilities we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase which could also reduce our margins 

  

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

  

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from a third party manufacturer in advance of selling our product we place orders with our manufacturer based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturer in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the time frame that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigations or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be disposed of if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position 

  

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

  

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures must be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process which averages six to twelve months requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional three to six months after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

  

if we fail to retain key employees in sales applications and finance and make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

  

since 2006 we significantly increased the quantity and quality of our sales applications and financial staff however if we fail to continue to adequately staff these areas and maintain internal controls that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about the company and its products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

  

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands or our business including design cycles our business could be harmed 

  

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

  

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships or acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities and we may be unable to successfully integrate these companies into our operations which would adversely affect our business 

  

as a part of our business strategy we may review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other growth opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership andor incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities such actions by us could impact our operating results andor the price of our common stock in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business 

  

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financing and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our competitors to include but not be limited to analog devices fairchild semiconductor intersil linear maxim integrated products micrel microsemi national semiconductor o2 richtech semtech stmicroelectronic and texas instruments we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market 

  

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the stock market in general often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

if securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

because of their significant stock ownership our officers and directors will be able to exert significant influence over our future direction 

  

executive officers directors and affiliated entities beneficially own in aggregate approximately 26 of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2007 these stockholders if acting 

  

together would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

  

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer supplier a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in asia such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

o2 micro inc 

  

since november 2000 we have been engaged in multiple legal proceedings involving patent infringement claims with o2 micro inc and its parent corporation o2 micro international limited referred to hereinafter as “o2” all of these claims relate to our ccfl backlight inverter products which are part of its lcd backlight inverter family 

  

in the united states district court for the northern district of california o2 alleged that certain of our ccfl products our foundry and several of our customers whose products incorporate our inverter controllers infringe o2’s ‘722 patent o2 also accused our customers of infringing o2’s ‘615 patent on february 8 2007 the court granted our summary judgment motion and denied o2’s claim for any monetary damages the court also granted summary judgment of noninfringement of the ‘615 patent in favor of our customers on march 14 2007 the court ruled on the parties summary judgment motions with respect to each party’s unfair competition claims and determined that neither party could recover monetary damages on may 15 2007 the jury returned a verdict that all of the ‘722 patent claims asserted by o2 against us our foundry and customers are invalid the jury also found that our ccfl products do not literally infringe the ‘722 patent on september 7 2007 the court dismissed 

  

with prejudice the parties’ unfair competition claims and counterclaims pursuant to a stipulation between the parties on october 30 2007 the court denied all posttrial motions and entered judgment in favor of the company subsequently o2 filed an appeal and we filed a crossappeal with the federal circuit the appeals are currently pending 

  

on may 1 2007 we filed for declaratory judgment relief in the united states district court for the northern district of california against o2 that certain of our ccfl products do not infringe o2’s ‘129 patent and that the ‘129 patent is invalid and unenforceable on february 12 2008 o2 filed a counterclaim and alleged certain of our ccfl products infringe the ‘129 patent the case is still in the early proceeding and no trial date has been set 

  

in addition to the us litigation described above o2 has brought various legal proceedings against us in taiwan based upon a taiwan patent we have obtained counterinjunctions from the taiwan courts against o2 one of which prohibits o2 from interfering with our or other parties’ manufacture sale use or importation by either us or a third party of certain of our ccfl products in connection with the counterinjunctions we posted cash bonds of approximately 61 million which are currently recorded as longterm restricted assets on our consolidated balance sheet in addition we posted an additional 19 million which we have included in restricted assets on the consolidated balance sheet to have our assets released and to avoid seizures until the matter with o2 is resolved if we do not prevail at trial we might have to forfeit some or all of these bonds any such forfeiture would be an expense in the quarter in which the outcome of the trial is probable and reasonably estimable which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position for that quarter 

  

taiwan sumida electronics 

  

in august 2005 we sued taiwan sumida electronics tse and were countersued by tse for material breach of the indemnity agreement seeking among other things reimbursement of attorney fees paid by us to tse’s attorneys on july 30 2007 we settled our litigation with tse concerning our december 25 2002 indemnification agreement with tse based on the settlement agreement we provided an upfront payment to tse of 25 million on october 22 2007 we placed into escrow an additional 74 million for which we could be liable subject to the outcome of certain legal activities the settlement agreement releases us and tse from all claims and indemnification obligations that relate to or arise under the patent infringement lawsuit brought by o2 micro international limited in the eastern district of texas o2 micro international limited v sumida corp et al case no c 030007 tjw and the lawsuit filed by us against tse in the northern district of california monolithic power systems inc v taiwan sumida electronics inc case no c 053522 cw the settlement agreement also terminates the indemnification agreement 

  

we recorded a onetime settlement provision of 98 million in the second quarter of 2007 

  

linear technology corporation 

  

on august 3 2006 linear technology “linear” filed an action against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware linear alleges that one of our parts infringes linear’s ‘178 and ‘258 patents and constitutes a breach of the settlement and license agreement dated october 1 2005 trial is currently scheduled for june 23 2008 and at this time we are not able to reasonably estimate the probability of loss or the range of possible loss in this case

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report on form 10k 

  

overview 

  

we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors we currently offer products that serve multiple markets including notebook computers flat panel displays cellular handsets digital cameras telecommunications equipment home entertainment systems and set top boxes among others we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as in new product categories 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain of our products while we will not be immune from future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths 

  

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes six to twelve months to achieve revenue volume production is usually achieved in three to six months after we receive an initial customer order for a new product typical lead times for orders are fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue challenging 

  

we derive most of our revenue from direct sales or sales through distribution arrangements to customers in asia where the components we produce are incorporated into an enduser product 90 of our revenue in 2007 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia we derive a 

  

majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which services the computing consumer electronics and communications markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to stockbased compensation inventories income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates under different estimates assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” issued by the staff of the sec sab 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in our generally recognizing revenue upon shipment when title passes to customers should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 

  

the majority of our sales are made through distribution arrangements with third parties we recognize revenue upon our shipment to those third party distributors under these distribution arrangements some of these arrangements include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months’ purchases we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns and information related to product in the distribution channel we record an estimate of the stock rotation returns at the time of sale 

  

our normal payment terms with our distributors are generally 30 to 45 days from invoice date and our arrangements with our largest distributors do not include price protection provisions in addition terms in a majority of our distribution agreements include the nonexclusive right to sell and the agreement to use best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in certain regions of the world and the ability to terminate the agreement by either party with up to three months notice estimated sales returns are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 

  

in 2006 we signed a distribution agreement with a us distributor revenue from this distributor is recognized upon sale by the distributor to the end customer because the distributor has certain rights of return which management believes are not estimable for the year ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we recognized 08 million and 02 million respectively in revenue that is attributable to this distributor we also had a distribution and service agreement with a distributor for which the revenue is deferred until the services have been performed for the year ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we recognized 22 million and 01 million respectively in revenue from this distributor we also had 07 million in deferred revenue from this distributor as of december 31 2007 

  

inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

  

accounting for income taxes  financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “fin 48” accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes and was adopted by us on january 1 2007 in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions on the tax returns if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made due to the adoption of fin 48 effective january 1 2007 we calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure 

  

as of december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we had a valuation allowance of 96 million 46 million and 21 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that a portion of the deferred tax assets generated from tax benefits associated with certain stock based compensation transactions will not be realized should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

  

contingencies  we are engaged in legal proceedings resulting from several patent infringement actions against us in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities using sfas no 5 “ accounting for contingencies ” to determine whether a 

  

contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas 5 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations which may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations 

  

accounting for stockbased compensation effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment  under the modified prospective method sfas 123r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of accounting principles board “apb” opinion 25 to stock compensation awards issued to employees rather the standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period  we currently use the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of our sharebased payments the blackscholes optionpricing model is based on a number of assumptions including expected volatility for which we use the average volatility of a number of our competitors and combine them with our limited historical volatility to come up with an overall volatility that is used in the model the blackscholes option pricing model also includes an assumption of expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends if these assumptions change stockbased compensation may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past the amount of stockbased compensation that we recognize is also based on an expected forfeiture rate if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stockbased compensation costs and the actual forfeitures which become known over time we may change the forfeiture rate which could have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

  

warranty reserves   we currently provide a 12month warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods or provide replacement products at no charge to the customer for defective products we record estimated warranty costs by product which are based on historical experience over the preceding 12 months by product at the time we recognize product revenue reserve requirements are recorded in the period of sale and are based on an assessment of the products sold with warranty and historical warranty costs incurred as the complexity of our products increases we could experience higher warranty claims relative to sales than we have previously experienced and we may need to increase these estimated warranty reserves 

  

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 sfas 157 fair value measurements this statement defined fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute accordingly this statement does not require any new fair value measurements this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we are currently evaluating the provision and are unable to estimate the impact 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets and financial liabilities on an instrumentbyinstrument basis if the fair value option is elected unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings subsequent to the adoption of sfas 159 changes in fair value are recognized in earnings sfas no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the provision and are unable to estimate the impact 

  

results of operations

the following table shows our revenue by product family amounts in thousands except percentages 

  

   

revenue revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 was 1340 million an increase of 290 million or 276 from 1050 million for year ended december 31 2006 the increase in revenue between the two periods resulted from increased sales of our dc to dc converters of 150 million lcd backlight inverter products of 65 million and audio products of 75 million for the year ended december 31 2007 despite a decline in our average sales price for certain of our units revenue from our dc to dc converters increased 209 due to increased sales of flat panel tvs and other consumer devices revenue for our ccfl products which are a part of our lcd backlight inverter family increased 223 due to strength in the notebook market over the same period in 2006 however given the uncertainty of the outcome of our litigation with o2 we cannot predict the impact that such litigation will have on such revenue in the future revenue for our audio amplifier product family increased by 1828 primarily due to increased demand for new and existing products used in consumer electronic applications 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 was 1050 million an increase of 59 million or 59 over 991 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in revenue primarily resulted from increased sales of our dc to dc converter products which increased 140 million or 242 the increase in dc to dc products was mainly due to higher sales volumes from existing products used in consumer electronic applications including tvs and portable dvds revenue from lcd backlight inverter products decreased 89 million or 234 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 primarily due to customer concerns resulting from our lawsuit with o2 and the availability of alternative solutions from parties not involved in the litigation revenue for our audio amplifier product family increased 08 million or 261 primarily due to increased demand for existing products used in consumer electronic applications 

  

gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin was 636 for year ended december 31 2007 and 637 for the year ended december 31 2006 our gross margin remained relatively flat year over year there was a decline in our average sales prices for certain of our mature dc to dc products which was offset by a shift in product mix and certain production efficiencies at our chengdu facility 

  

gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin remained constant at 637 for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 in the first half of 2006 we incurred startup costs for our chengdu facilities in the amount of 08 million however due to a change in product mix and efficiencies in test costs resulting from the startup of our chengdu operations we were able to absorb those costs and maintain our margins

rd expenses were 273 million or 204 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 and 223 million or 212 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in rd 

  

expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 was due to increased bonus accruals for rd personnel costs associated with an increase in headcount for design engineering personnel as well as new product development activities primarily in the dc to dc product line both in the us and asia rd expenses also increased because of patent related activities 

  

rd expenses were 223 million or 212 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 and 148 million or 150 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was due to costs associated with an increase in design engineering personnel as well as new product development activities both in the us and asia we also completed the start up phase of our design center in china and initiated startup activities for several design centers outside of california rd expenses also increased due to additional stock compensation expenses related to the adoption of sfas 123r effective january 1 2006

sga expenses were 276 million or 263 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 and 184 million or 186 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 sga expenses increased as a result of our strengthening our sales distribution and finance infrastructure sga also increased due to an increase in professional fees primarily for audit tax and accounting services and activities related to sarbanesoxley compliance the implementation of sfas 123r and the restatement of prior sec filings 

  

patent litigation settlement

lease abandonment 

  

   

in december 2006 we abandoned our lease in los gatos and wrote off 12 million in operating expenses based on the fair value of the liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  in may 2007 we entered into a sublease agreement to rent a portion of our los gatos facility for a period of 21 months commencing on june 1 2007 during which we are to receive gross payments of 07 million as the amount we expect to receive is greater than the amount we originally estimated we reduced the estimate of our remaining liability by 05 million in the second quarter of 2007 

  

interest and other income interest and other income was 47 million 26 million and 17 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively interest and other income increased due to higher yields and higher cash cash equivalent and shortterm investment balances and is comprised primarily of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

  

other expense other expense comprised mainly of vat expenses was 01 million 03 million and 01 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

income tax provision benefit the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2007 was 50 million or 349 of our income before income taxes we recorded a onetime write off 

  

of our deferred tax assets in the amount of 15 million in the quarter ended march 31 2007 as we no longer expect that any of our deferred tax assets will be realized in addition we had a full valuation allowance against the tax benefits from the unpaid portion of the tse litigation settlement which was offset by deductions from stock option exercises and the paid portion of the tse litigation settlement 

  

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2006 was 65 million or 1795 of the pretax income this differs from the federal statutory rate of 34 primarily for the following reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

for additional information see note 9 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

cumulative effect of applying sab 108 in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 sab 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements in connection with the adoption of sab 108 effective january 1 2006 we corrected our financial statements for the cumulative effect of certain prior period errors by decreasing accumulated deficit and accounts payable as of the sab 108 adoption date by 033 million these errors had resulted from the duplicate recording of certain inventory costs in 2003 2004 and 2005 in addition an error resulting from unrecorded stock grants in 2000 and 2001 was corrected by increasing accumulated deficit and common stock as of the sab 108 adoption date by 027 million we used our historical method for evaluating materiality prior to the adoption of sab 108 and determined that these errors were not material to the financial statements for any of the prior periods 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2007 we had working capital of 1193 million including cash and cash equivalents of 831 million and shortterm investments of 278 million compared to working capital of 770 million including cash and cash equivalents of 508 million and shortterm investments of 277 million as of december 31 2006 we financed our growth primarily with proceeds from the issuance of common stock the exercise of stock options and cash generated from operating activities 

  

for the year ended december 31 2007 net cash provided by operating activities was 243 million primarily due to increased sales and an increase in accrued liabilities primarily resulting from a provision for litigation of 98 million for the tse lawsuit 74 million of which has been placed in escrow and for which the company could be potentially liable this was partially offset by an increase in inventory purchases in anticipation of future demand requirements for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 net cash provided by operating activities of 118 million and 172 million respectively primarily from increased revenues and related margin contributions 

  

for the year ended december 31 2007 net cash used by investing activities was 139 million primarily due to capital equipment purchases of 67 million in addition we placed in escrow 74 

  

million for which we could be liable subject to the outcome of certain legal activities for the year ended december 31 2006 net cash generated from investing activities was 66 million primarily due to net proceeds from our investments in the amount of 111 million and releasing a restriction on our cash in the amount of 29 million cash that was previously restricted as collateral to a surety bond that we have outstanding as a result of our litigation with o2 is no longer restricted these amounts were offset by capital purchases of 75 million primarily related to our facility in chengdu and the ramping up of our research and development activities for the year ended december 31 2005 we used 266 million in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 we had net proceeds from sale of shortterm investments of 1722 million which was offset by purchases of shortterm investments of 1941 million for the year ended december 31 2005 we purchased 19 million of capital equipment 

  

we use professional investment management firms to manage the majority of our invested cash within the us the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds outside of the us our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in us treasury notes and other sovereign obligations and highly rated corporate notes the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes 

  

the market for auctionrate securities which are generally issued by municipalities with interest rates that reset through a dutch auction every 7 to 35 days has recently become illiquid as of march 7 2008 our investment portfolio included 397 million in auction rate securities backed by municipal bonds and governmentbacked student loans as of this date 22 of the auctionrate securities in our portfolio totaling 360 million have failed to reset through successful auction the underlying maturity of these auctionrate securities is up to 30 years and the underlying credit quality of these instruments in which we have invested has not been downgraded and remains aaa rated it is uncertain as to when these investments will regain their liquidity and our management is in the process of assessing the value of these securities while it is too early to quantify the impact if this situation continues the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be negatively impacted and the value of our investment portfolio could decline accordingly we may be required to reclassify our auctionrate securities as longterm investments rather than shortterm investments and to record impairment charges in the value of such investments 

  

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 218 million primarily from the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock in the amount of 173 million and excess tax benefits related to the exercise of options in the amount of 45 million net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 73 million primarily from the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock in the amount of 53 million excess tax benefits related to the exercise of options in the amount of 16 million and the repayment of a stockholder note in the amount of 04 million net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was 27 million primarily from the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock in the amount of 27 million 

  

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding our operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 

  

we lease our headquarters and sales offices in san jose california under a noncancelable operating lease which expires in october 2009 although we relocated our headquarters from los 

  

gatos california to san jose we have a noncancelable lease on our los gatos facility which expires in february 2009 for which we signed an agreement in may 2007 to sublease a portion of the property for the remaining term in the second quarter of 2007 we reversed 05 million of the 13 million writeoff that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 as a result of the aforementioned sublease certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases in addition as described below we have a fiveyear lease arrangement which we entered into in september 2004 for our manufacturing facility located in chengdu china we also lease our sales offices in japan china taiwan and korea 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2007 we qualified a second source foundry and have incorporated their wafers in our production units as of december 31 2007 our total outstanding purchase commitments were 91 million which includes wafer purchases from our two foundries and the purchase of assembly services primarily from multiple contractors in asia this compares to purchase commitments of 93 million as of december 31 2006 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility of approximately 02 million we also have the option to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 21 million 

  

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years in thousands 

  

   

in january 2008 we made our final payment of 10 million to micrel as part of a settlement agreement 

  

because of the uncertainty as to the timing of payments related to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded estimated obligations of 55 million from the table above 

  

as of december 31 2007 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4 of the securities and exchange commission’s regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

interest rate risk 

  

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities 

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investments in debt securities are classified as availableforsale and no gains or losses are recognized by us in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or are determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired these investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains being included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

fluctuations in interest rates by  10 could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 05 million 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes in 2007 the primary functional currency of the company’s offshore operations was the local currency primarily the new taiwan dollar and the chinese yuan to date fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations however fluctuations in the currency by  10 could impact our annual results of operations by approximately 15 million 

  

value change to investments 

  

as of march 7 2008 we had 397 million invested in auction rate securities some of which have failed to reset as a result of current market conditions should these auctions continue to fail and if the credit rating for these securities decline a 10 decline in the par value could impact our results of operations by approximately 40 million

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend   

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15 and rule 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

  

based on our evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15df our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

  

our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a deficiency in design exists when a a control necessary to meet the control objective is missing or b an existing control is not properly designed so that even if the control operates as designed the control objective would not be met a deficiency in operation exists when a properly designed control does not operate as designed or when the person performing the control does not possess the necessary authority or competence to perform the control effectively a significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in 

  

internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 in performing this assessment management used the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—an integrated framework based upon this assessment our management has concluded that as of december 31 2007 our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp which audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report included elsewhere herein on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  

while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance that their respective objectives will be met we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors and all fraud any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified either as discrete devices such as individual transistors or as ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for ‘high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics ‘high performance’ products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors which include integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish analog and mixedsignal ic markets from digital ic markets and in particular the high performance portion of the analog and mixed signal ic market these factors include longer product life cycles numerous market segments technology that is difficult to replicate relative complexity of design and process technology importance of experienced design engineers lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets we have however targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

products and applications 

  

we currently have three primary product families that address multiple applications within the computing consumer electronics and communications markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

  

direct current dc to dc converters dc to dc converter ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points home appliances automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc converters are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their high degree of integration and rapid switching speeds these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components smaller form factors more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system costs through the elimination of discrete power devices 

  

light emitting diode led driver ics are also included in our dc to dc product family led driver ics are used in lighting displays in small portable devices such as color cellular handsets personal digital assistants global positioning systems and electronic gaming systems as well as in emerging applications such as traffic lights and automobile signal lights we were one of the first companies to offer led driver ics with a protection feature that limits damage to a system in the event of a poor power connection we believe that our led driver ics are differentiated in the market particularly with respect to their small form factor power efficiency and costeffectiveness 

  

liquid crystal display lcd backlight inverters lcd backlight inverter ics are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebook computers lcd monitors car navigational systems and more recently lcd televisions these ics function by converting low voltage direct current dc or battery voltage to high voltage alternating current ac we believe our lcd backlight inverter ics were the first to utilize a full bridge resonant topology that allows for high efficiency extended lifetimes for cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfls and lower 

  

signal interference with adjacent components the full bridge topology is now the industry standard for these products we also believe that our lcd backlight inverter ics are the semiconductor industry’s only backlight inverter ics with four fullyintegrated power devices this integration reduces the overall size total solution part count and cost for our customers our lcd product family encompasses all of the products that we formerly referred to as our ccfl product family as well as other nonccfl solutions for lcd backlight inverters 

  

audio amplifiers audio amplifier ics are used to amplify sound produced by audio processors we currently offer class d audio amplifiers which are wellsuited for applications that require both a small form factor and high power efficiency such as plasma televisions lcd televisions and dvd players with today’s systems becoming smaller and utilizing larger amounts of power solution sizes and the management of heat dissipation are becoming increasingly important to the overall system design the high degree of power efficiency and small form factor provided by our class d audio amplifiers allows system vendors to significantly reduce heat dissipation eliminating the costly and sizable fans and heat sinks traditionally required by audio amplifier ics these features enable our customers to achieve their design and cost objectives without sacrificing sound quality 

  

we currently target our products at the computing consumer electronics and wireless markets with the computing market representing the largest portion of our revenue as we continue to expand our product portfolio and addressable markets and as other end markets in which we participate continue to grow we expect our revenue from the computing market to decline as a percentage of our total revenue over time 

  

the following is a brief summary of our product family solutions for various applications for each of these applications we are currently shipping product or have design wins which are decisions by oems or odms to use our ics 

  

   

we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter ic product family to the computing consumer electronics and wireless markets in the future we expect to introduce additional new products within our existing product families such as high current high voltage small form factor switching voltage regulators battery chargers voltage references and low dropout regulators our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter new market segments gain market share expand our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

customers sales and marketing 

  

we sell our products through third party distributors and directly to oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers our third party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with mps which allow the distributor to sell our products to end customers and other resellers distributors may distribute our products to end customers which include oems odms or electronic manufacturing service providers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and electronic manufacturing service providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers for the year ended december 31 2006 sales to our two largest customers accounted for 31 of our total revenue this is a decrease from prior years as we experienced increased diversity in our customer base the following is a summary for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 of those customers that accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in one or more of these years 

  

    

current distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor shall have the nonexclusive right to sell and use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in several countries in asia these agreements may be terminated by either us or the distributor on up to three months’ notice these agreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice in addition we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements 

  

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china korea and japan and have marketing representatives in europe for the year ended december 31 2006 88 of our direct and indirect sales were to customers located in asia our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we assist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application we maintain a staff of applications engineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems electronics containing our products 

  

because our sales are billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are not directly subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because 88 of our revenue in 2006 was attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers which have not yet shipped our backlog at december 31 2006 was 136 million we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future sales order lead times may vary and as is common within our industry customers are allowed to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice our quarterly revenue is also influenced by orders booked and shipped within that quarter which are not reflected as backlog at the end of any preceding quarter our manufacturing lead times are generally 4 to 12 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders based on our forecast of future customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that sales will not meet our forecast which could lead to inventories in excess of demand if excess inventory exists it may be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets these include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits expertise in mixedsignal integration and the development of proprietary semiconductor process technologies 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas systems architecture circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of systems architecture we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products in 2006 we expanded our research and development and design activities in china with the addition of new employees and capabilities 

  

we developed a proprietary process technology bcd plus™ that is applicable across a wide range of analog and mixedsignal products in 2006 we introduced 6amp and 8amp switching voltage regulators with high voltage capability in small form factors as the first products in our minimonster™ family these innovative products provide high performance and a high degree of integration which are created on our bcd plus™ process technology we intend to continue to invest in our process technology to create smaller footprint higher power and more costeffective devices 

  

research and development expenses were approximately 223 million 148 million and 129 million in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively which includes stockbased compensation of 52 million 26 million and 52 million respectively 

  

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of february 15 2007 we have 169 patents issued and pending of which 20 have been issued in the united states our us issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through june 2025 and our other issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through october 2025 our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we have entered into a patent license agreement with another integrated circuit company pursuant to which we have granted this company a license with certain limited sublicense rights under certain of our patents to make use and sell certain of this company’s own integrated circuit products for a period of two years and for which this company is obligated to pay us royalties based on sales of those products we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to 

  

issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation with o2 micro international limited and linear technology corporation for a more complete description of our legal matters please read item 3 legal proceedings and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management resources further we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and a supplier in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or supplier or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technology on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields for our integrated circuits 

  

we currently contract with advanced semiconductor manufacturing corporation of shanghai “asmc” to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped either to third party subcontractors or to our facility in chengdu china for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in malaysia and china the assembled ics are then sent for final testing at our chengdu facility prior to shipping to our customers 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and have exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility for approximately 02 million we also have the option to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 22 million the facility is fully operational and we have already experienced a reduction in costs due to significantly shorter manufacturing cycle times in the intermediate to long term we intend to expand our product testing capabilities in our china facility and to position ourselves to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support operations 

  

key personnel and employees 

  

our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude than the more prevalent digital circuit design engineer analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would harm the business our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract train retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike our management considers employee relations to be good as of december 31 2006 we employed 393 employees located in the united states taiwan china japan korea and europe 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include analog devices inc fairchild semiconductor international intersil corporation linear technology maxim integrated products micrel inc microsemi corporation national semiconductor corporation o2 micro international richtech co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics and texas instruments incorporated 

  

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive with respect to these factors particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than most of our competition however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business involves risks and uncertainties you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 

  

if we are unsuccessful in any of the legal proceedings between us and o2 micro linear technology or taiwan sumida electronics we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages or fines an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results 

  

we are engaged in legal proceedings with o2 micro and linear technology these proceedings involve various claims and counterclaims in the united states and taiwan alleging among other things patent and trade secret infringement misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition o2 micro has also taken legal action against our wafer manufacturer and various customers and users of our products in taiwan and the united states some of which we are indemnifying see part 1 item 3 of our current form 10k for a description of each of these proceedings 

  

if we or our customers are not ultimately successful in any of these litigations or other litigations that could be brought against us or if any of the decisions in our favor are reversed on appeal we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages if we are found liable for willful patent infringement or trade secret misappropriation damages could be doubled or tripled we andor our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products either into taiwan or in the us moreover our customers and endusers could decide not to use our products our wafer manufacturer could decide to reduce or eliminate its manufacturing of some of our products or our products or our customers’ accounts payable to us could be seized in taiwan finally interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings 

  

we are also engaged in a legal proceeding with taiwan sumida electronics inc tse in november 2005 a jury found that tse infringed one of o2 micro’s patents the products that were the subject of the litigation contained some of our products in august 2005 we terminated an indemnity agreement we had previously entered with tse and sued tse for material breach of the agreement in january 2006 tse filed a counterclaim against us for breach of the indemnification agreement and related claims if we do not ultimately prevail on our contention that tse materially breached our agreement we could be required to pay tse damages including any damages awarded against tse in favor of o2 micro as well as any attorneys fees and costs resulting from these lawsuits 

  

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publiclydisclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and business 

  

until our legal proceedings with o2 micro tse and linear technology are resolved we will continue to incur significant legal expenses that vary with the level of activity in each of these proceedings this level of activity is not entirely within our control as we may need to respond to legal actions by the opposing parties or scheduling decisions by the judges consequently it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses our stock price could be impacted 

  

our ongoing legal proceedings and the potential for additional legal proceedings have diverted financial and management resources 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation matters with o2 and linear technology patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims such litigation is very costly in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time effort and energy to these legal proceedings which could adversely affect our business 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

  

our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenue andor a loss of market share to competitors 

  

as we develop new product lines we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past some of our new product lines require us to reequip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets 

  

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we have a history of losses and we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 

  

since our inception in 1997 we have only been profitable in one year our accumulated deficit is 176 million as of december 31 2006 for the year ended december 31 2006 our net loss was 29 million we expect to incur significant operating expenses over the next several years in connection with the continued development and expansion of our business our operating expenses include general and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses litigation expenses stockbased compensation expenses and research and development expenses relating to products that will not be introduced and will not generate revenue until later periods if at all in addition we expect to continue to incur significant legal expenses in connection with the litigations in which we are involved we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 

  

we do not expect to sustain our recent growth rate 

  

from 2002 through 2005 our revenues increased significantly from 122 million to 991 million due primarily to increased sales of our dc to dc converter and lcd backlight inverter product families in 2006 however we experienced some slowing in revenue growth across several of our product lines including our dc to dc product line in which we experienced increased price competition for some of our products as well as longer than expected new product acceptance by our customers in addition we experienced a decline in revenue growth of our ccfl backlight inverter products in which we experienced increased competition and customer concerns resulting from our ongoing litigation with o2 micro our revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 was 1050 million due to increased competition market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and ongoing litigation we do not expect growth rates comparable to past periods 

  

due to the nature of our business as a component supplier we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses 

  

we were incorporated in 1997 and did not generate significant revenue until 2000 because we provide components for end products and systems demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ end product demand as a result we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses our revenue depends on the timing size and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products all of which are inherently difficult to forecast as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems in addition demand for our products is influenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which in itself is inherently difficult to forecast if our customers including distributors do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 

  

finally a significant percentage of our revenue in each quarter is dependent on sales that are booked and shipped in the same quarter this is referred to as our turns business due to increased dependence on our turns business and the fact that we typically do not enter into longterm agreements with our customers or require them to provide us with quarterly forecasts it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenue for any given quarter 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline 

  

our revenue expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease 

  

we believe that the application of our products in the computer consumer electronics networking and wireless markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenue will decrease for example as technology evolves the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components including our discrete semiconductor products onto a single chip andor onto other components of systems containing our products increases should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer demand for our products could decrease and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

moreover approximately one quarter of our business is based on products that are used in systems that contain cold cathode fluorescent lighting ccfl ccfl tubes contain mercury which is the subject of environmental concerns particularly in europe should environmental issues impair the widespread use of our ccflbased products and should we be unable to produce replacement products based on led lighting fast enough to compensate for the loss of our ccflrelated business our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

we receive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

  

we market our products through distribution arrangements and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include original equipment manufacturers original design manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers receivables from our customers are not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible for the year ended december 31 2006 sales to our two largest customers accounted for 31 of our total revenue significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis and we do not have any longterm supply contracts 

  

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of original equipment manufacturers or oems although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor original design manufacturers to incorporate our products we do not have purchase commitments from these end users therefore there can be no assurance that the oems andor original design manufacturers will continue to incorporate our ics into their products oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an endcustomer for whom we have had previous design wins we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 

  

we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products and if demand is not as expected we may have insufficient or excess inventory which could adversely impact our financial position 

  

as a fabless semiconductor company we purchase our inventory from a third party manufacturer in advance of selling our product we place orders with our manufacturer based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products while our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturer in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the time frame that is required we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders unexpected order cancellations injunctions due to patent litigations or product returns we may have excess inventory which if not sold may need to be disposed of if any of these situations were to arise it could have a material impact on our business and financial position 

  

if we fail to retain key employees in sales applications and finance and make continued improvements to our internal systems particularly in the accounting and finance area our business may suffer 

  

in 2006 we significantly increased the quantity and quality of our sales applications and financial staff however if we fail to continue to adequately staff these areas and maintain internal controls that meet the demands of our business our ability to operate effectively will suffer the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about the company and its products and if they were to terminate their employment our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives including michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology in addition personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are 

  

unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands or our business including design cycles our business could be harmed 

  

we currently depend on one thirdparty supplier to provide us with wafers for our products if our wafer supplier fails to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenue and gross margin may decline 

  

we have a supply arrangement with asmc for the production of wafers although certain aspects of our relationship with asmc are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on asmc’s continued cooperation and our management relationships o2 sued asmc for patent infringement because asmc manufactures our products it is possible that our relationship with asmc could be materially and adversely affected by the o2 litigation in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional this could potentially reduce the yields the failure of asmc to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue 

  

although we provide asmc with rolling forecasts of our production requirements asmc’s ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity particularly capacity in the geometries we require at the facilities in which it manufactures wafers for us an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause asmc to reduce capacity available to us asmc may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements if asmc extends lead times limits supplies or the types of capacity we require or increases prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenue and gross margin may decline 

  

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice under our agreement with asmc we have an option to order wafers based on a committed forecast that can cover a period of one to six months if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to asmc for the corresponding wafers we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

  

all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a significant percentage of our testing is currently performed by thirdparty subcontractors we do not have any longterm agreements with these subcontractors as a result we may not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies 

  

used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology including through patents however there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia which may expose us to political cultural regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

  

we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct or indirect sales through distribution arrangements with parties located in asia as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations in 2006 approximately 88 of our revenue was from customers in asia there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

devaluation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies including the chinese yuan may adversely affect results of operations 

  

our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will be substantially located in china should the value of the chinese yuan continue to rise against the us dollar there could be an increase in 

  

our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the us which could adversely affect our operations in addition because we collect payments from all customers in us dollars fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could have an adverse impact on our customers’ business which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

  

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation and may receive the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that include conditions or may be reduced or eliminated any of which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

  

most of our manufacturing partners including asmc our current foundry are located in china in addition we have established a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to the facility we are establishing in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

we may incur additional expenses in connection with the operation of our testing facility in china which could increase product costs 

  

we have constructed a new testing facility in china and have begun operations in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this annual report we face the following risks among others 

  

   

   

   

if we are unable to continue a fully operational status with appropriate controls we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels which would affect our gross margins in addition if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

  

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures must be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we 

  

have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process which averages six to twelve months requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional three to six months after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

  

our products must meet exacting specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

  

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems in 2005 we extended our standard warranty period from 90 days to one year as a result we now have an increased risk of claims for defects and failures if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenue increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support delays in cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

  

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

  

we intend to continue to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

  

we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth strategic relationships or acquisitions we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs 

  

to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financing and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with several domestic and nondomestic semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our competitors to include but not be limited to analog devices fairchild semiconductor intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products micrel microsemi national semiconductor corporation o2 micro richtech co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronic and texas instruments we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market 

  

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the stock market in general often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

if securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of the company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

because of their significant stock ownership our officers and directors will be able to exert significant influence over our future direction 

  

executive officers directors and affiliated entities beneficially own in aggregate approximately 31 of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2006 these stockholders if acting together would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

  

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer supplier a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenue as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in southeast asia such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities and we may be unable to successfully integrate these companies into our operations which would adversely affect our business 

  

as a part of our business strategy we may review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other growth opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership andor incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities such actions by us could impact our operating results andor the price of our common stock in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

o2 micro inc 

  

since november 2000 we have been engaged in multiple legal proceedings with o2 micro inc and its parent corporation o2 micro international limited referred to hereinafter as “o2” these proceedings involve various claims and counterclaims in the united states and taiwan alleging patent infringement trade secret misappropriation and unfair competition all of these claims relate to our ccfl backlight inverter products which are part of our lcd backlight inverter family for a more complete description of the litigations and recent court orders please see part i item 3 of the company’s form 10k filed with the securities and exchange commission on march 28 2006 part ii item 1 of the company’s form 10q filed with the securities and exchange commission on august 4 2006 and the company’s form 8k filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 12 2007 

  

there are two cases pending in the us 

  

the first case is now on appeal to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit in this case o2 claimed that the company misappropriated certain trade secrets and the company claimed that o2 infringed certain of its patents a provision for litigation in the amount of 35 million has been set aside for this matter we will continue to incur substantial legal expenses in connection with the appeals in this case if o2 were to be successful on any appeals from the judgments the initial jury award of 12 million which was subsequently overturned could be reinstated andor o2’s claims could be remanded for further proceedings rulings against us on any of these issues on retrial could result in an award of damages to o2 or an injunction against selling our ccfl products in the us any such injunction could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations to date direct sales of our ccfl products in the us have not been significant 

  

the second case is now pending in the united states district court for the northern district of california in this action o2 alleged that certain of our ccfl products and several of our indirect customers and supplier infringe o2’s ‘722 patent and that we and our ceo michael hsing engaged in unfair competition on february 8 2007 the court granted our motion that o2 has presented no evidence of damages finding that o2’s damages claim was unreliable and inadmissible we are defending and indemnifying some of these defendants trial is currently scheduled for april 30 2007 if we do not prevail in trial and o2 were to be successful on seeking an injunction against selling our ccfl products in the us any such injunction would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation 

  

in addition to the us litigation described above o2 has brought various legal proceedings against us in taiwan based upon a taiwan patent unlike the us where a party seeking a preliminary injunction must first file a lawsuit on the merits of the underlying claim in taiwan it is possible for a party to be granted a preliminary injunction without first filing a lawsuit on the merits in january 2003 a court in taiwan issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing designing displaying importing or selling our mp1011a and mp1015 products in taiwan either directly or through a third party acting at our request we are pursuing various legal avenues to remove the preliminary injunction andor have o2’s taiwan patent declared invalid 

  

we have obtained two counterinjunctions from the taiwan courts against o2 one of which prohibits o2 from interfering with our or other parties’ manufacture sale use or importation by either us or a third party of certain of our ccfl products we posted cash bonds of approximately 61 million which are currently recorded as restricted assets on our balance sheet in addition we posted an additional 19 million to have our assets released and to avoid seizures until the matter with o2 is resolved if we do not prevail at trial we might have to forfeit some or all of these bonds any such forfeiture would be an expense in the quarter in which the outcome of the trial is probable and reasonably estimable which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position for that quarter we are not currently able to reasonably estimate the probability of loss or the range of possible loss in the taiwan matters discussed above 

  

taiwan sumida electronics 

  

in august 2005 we sued taiwan sumida electronics tse and were countersued by tse for material breach of the indemnity agreement seeking among other things reimbursement of attorney fees paid by us to tse’s attorneys if we do not win this litigation we could be required to reimburse tse for the amount of any final judgment obtained by o2 against tse and other damages tse may claim in the future resulting from our termination of the indemnity agreement trial is currently scheduled for july 9 2007 we are not currently able to reasonably estimate the probability of loss or the range of possible loss in this case 

  

linear technology corporation 

  

on august 3 2006 linear technology “linear” filed an action in the united states district court for the district of delaware linear alleges that our newly introduced synchronous rectified stepup converter mps 1543 infringes linear’s ‘178 and ‘258 patents and constitutes a breach of the settlement and license agreement dated october 1 2005 we are investigating the claims involved in this allegation we are not able to reasonably determine the risk of any losses or estimate the range of possible losses in this case

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report on form 10k 

  

overview 

  

we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs develops and markets proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal integrated circuits “ics” we currently offer products that serve multiple markets including notebook computers flat panel displays cellular handsets digital cameras wireless local area network lan access points home entertainment systems and personal digital assistants among others we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated smaller in size more energy efficient more accurate with respect to performance specifications and consequently more costeffective than many competing solutions we plan to introduce additional new products within our existing product families as well as in new product categories a description of our products may be found in part i item i of this report under the heading “business” 

  

we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is no strong or primary influence of seasonality while we will not be immune from future industry downturns we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry growth over the long term 

  

we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths 

  

following the introduction of a product our sales cycle generally takes six to twelve months to complete volume production is usually achieved in three to six months after we receive an initial customer order for a new product typical lead times for orders are fewer than 90 days these factors combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer make the forecasting of our orders and revenue challenging 

  

we sell our ics primarily through distribution arrangements and through our direct sales and applications support organization to original design manufacturers and electronic manufacturing 

  

service providers in 2006 sales to our top two customers represented 31 of our revenues which is less than the amount represented by our top two customers in 2005 this is attributable to the diversification of our customer base see note 13 “segment information” to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

we derive the majority of our revenue from direct sales or sales through distribution arrangements to customers in asia where the components we produce are incorporated into an enduser product sales to our taiwan distributors in 2006 were significantly lower than in 2005 in part due to our lawsuit with o2 micro for that reason sales to asia decreased as a percentage of revenue from 95 in 2005 to 88 in 2006 

  

we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which services the computing consumer electronics and wireless markets we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part on our ability to develop new products enter new market segments gain market share manage litigation risk diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity 

  

in 2006 we settled our lawsuits with microsemi for 15 million for which we recorded a provision in the fourth quarter of 2005 and micrel for 30 million for which we recorded a liability for in the third quarter of 2006 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable inventories income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are by their nature uncertain and unpredictable and depend upon among other things many factors outside of our control such as demand for our products and economic conditions accordingly our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ perhaps significantly from these estimates under different estimates assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” issued by the staff of the sec sab 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in our generally recognizing revenue upon shipments when title passes to customers should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 

  

the majority of our sales are made through distribution arrangements with third parties we recognize revenue upon our shipment to those third party distributors under these distribution arrangements some of these arrangements include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percent of the previous six months’ purchases in 2006 we established a sales reserve for those stock rotation rights our normal payment terms with our distributors are generally 30 to 45 days from invoice date and our arrangements with our largest distributors do not include price protection provisions in addition terms in a majority of our distribution agreements include the nonexclusive right to sell and the agreement to use best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in certain regions of the world and the ability to terminate the agreement by either party with up to three months notice estimated sales returns are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 

  

in the first quarter of 2006 we signed a distribution agreement with a major us distributor revenue from this distributor will be recognized upon sale by the distributor to the end customer at december 31 2006 02 million in deferred revenue was recorded for shipments to this distributor 

  

inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand on assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

  

accounting for income taxes  financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “fin 48” accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an amendment of fasb statement no 5 accounting for contingencies and an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

  

as of december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we had a valuation allowance of 24 million 21 million and 18 million respectively attributable to management’s determination that a portion of the deferred tax assets generated from tax benefits associated with certain stock based compensation transactions will not be realized should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made 

  

contingencies  we are engaged in legal proceedings resulting from several patent infringement actions two of which also include claims for trade secret misappropriation in addition from time to time we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities when this occurs we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities using sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the facts and circumstances in each matter we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated if we determine a loss is probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas 5 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations which may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on results of operations 

  

accounting for stockbased compensation our stockbased employee compensation expenses are described more fully in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r sharebased payment  under the modified prospective method sfas 123r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of accounting principles board “apb” opinion 25 to stock compensation awards issued to employees rather the standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 

  

warranty reserves warranty reserves were established beginning august 1 2005 due to a change in the standard warranty period in our agreements with our customers prior to august 1 2005 we provided a standard 90 day warranty against any defects in material and workmanship we currently provide a 12month warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods provide replacement products at no charge to the customer or refund amounts to the customer for defective products we record estimated warranty costs which are based on historical experience over the preceding 12 months by product at the time we recognize product revenue as the complexity of our products increases we could experience higher warranty claims relative to sales than we have previously experienced and we may need to increase these estimated warranty reserves 

  

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 sfas 157 fair value measurements this statement defined fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute accordingly this statement does not require any new fair value measurements this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we are currently evaluating the provision and are currently unable to estimate the impact 

  

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an amendment of fasb statement no 5 accounting for contingencies and an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109  this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are currently evaluating the provision and are currently unable to estimate the impact 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings sfas no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 159 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 

  

results of operations 

  

the table below shows the statement of operations amounts and shows each as a percentage of revenue 

  

   

revenue revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 was 1050 million an increase of 59 million or 59 over 991 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in revenue primarily resulted from increased sales of our dc to dc converter products which increased 140 million or 242 the increase in dc to dc products is mainly due to higher sales volumes from existing products used in consumer electronic applications including tvs and portable dvds revenue from lcd backlight inverter products decreased 89 million or 234 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 primarily due to customer 

  

concerns resulting from our lawsuit with o2 micro and the availability of alternative solutions from parties not involved in the litigation revenue for our audio amplifier product family increased 08 million or 261 primarily due to increased demand for existing products used in consumer electronic applications 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 was 991 million an increase of 515 million or 1083 over 476 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in revenue primarily resulted from increased sales of our dc to dc converter products which increased 334 million or 1370 the increase in dc to dc products was mainly due to higher sales volumes from existing products used in consumer electronic applications including tvs and portable dvds and revenue from new products which began shipping in 2005 revenue from our lcd backlight inverter products increased 162 million or 740 for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 revenue for our audio amplifier product family increased 19 million or 1477 primarily due to increased demand for existing products used in consumer electronic applications such as tvs and revenue from new products which began shipping in 2005 

  

the following table shows our revenue by product family amounts in thousands 

  

   

gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin remained constant at 637 for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 in the first half of 2006 we incurred startup costs for our chengdu facilities in the amount of 08 million however due to a change in product mix and efficiencies in test costs resulting from the startup of our chengdu operations we were able to absorb those costs and maintain our margins 

  

gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin was 637 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 588 for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in gross profit was primarily due to volume efficiencies attributable to growth in unit shipments in all of our product families during the fourth quarter of 2005 our gross profit was adversely impacted by 03 million of startup expenses for our chengdu testing facility 

  

research and development research and development rd expenses consist of salary and benefit expenses for design and product engineers expenses related to new product development and related facility costs 

  

   

rd expenses were 223 million or 212 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 and 148 million or 150 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was due to costs associated with an increase in design engineering personnel as well as new product development activities both in the us and asia we also completed the start up phase of our design center in china and initiated startup activities for several design centers outside of california rd expenses also increased due to additional stock compensation expenses related to the adoption of sfas 123r effective january 1 2006 

  

rd expenses were 148 million or 150 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 and 129 million or 270 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase of 20 million was primarily due to an increase in personnel and wage related expenses for new product development we believe that investments in research and development including the recruiting and hiring of design engineers are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products we will continue to focus on longterm opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of new products related to these end markets 

  

selling general and administrative selling general and administrative sga expenses include salary and benefit expenses sales commissions travel expenses related facilities costs outside legal and accounting fees and fees associated with sarbanesoxley compliance requirements 

  

   

sga expenses were 276 million or 263 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 and 184 million or 186 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 sga expenses increased to strengthen the sales distribution and finance infrastructure sga also increased due to an increase in professional fees primarily for audit tax and accounting services and activities related to sarbanesoxley compliance the implementation of sfas 123r and the restatement of prior sec filings 

  

sga expenses were 184 million or 186 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 and 125 million or 264 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily due to increases in personnel and wage related expenses of 37 million and increases in professional services and insurance costs of 33 million related to increased audit and tax related services compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act and increased do insurance costs 

  

we believe that nongaap rd and sga excluding stockbased compensation expense are useful measures that allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in our financial and operational decision making and are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business these measures also allow our investors to compare our historical performance to that of our competitors 

  

patent litigation 

  

   

patent litigation expenses were 146 million or 139 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 234 million or 236 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 this included a 30 million settlement with micrel and a provision for litigation of 35 million for our lawsuit with o2 in 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in patent litigation expenses was due to the settlement of certain lawsuits in 2005 and 2006 and a corresponding reduction in legal costs for those cases for a more complete description of our litigation matters please see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 11 “litigation” of notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

patent litigation expenses were 234 million or 236 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 which included a provision for litigation of 35 million for our lawsuit with o2 patent litigation expenses were 78 million or 165 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in patent litigation expenses was due to an increase in activities associated with multiple lawsuits in the united states several trials and trial preparations in 2005 and a settlement with microsemi in 2006 for which we recorded an expense in 2005 

  

lease abandonment 

  

in december 2006 we abandoned our lease in los gatos and incurred a related impairment charge in the amount of 13 million of which 01 million was allocated to cost of revenue 

  

interest and other income interest and other income was 26 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and 17 million for the year ended december 31 2005 interest and other income increased due to higher cash balances and higher yields and is comprised primarily of interest earned on our cash and shortterm investments 

  

interest and other income was 17 million for the year ended december 31 2005 and 02 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in interest income was primarily due to the increase in our cash and shortterm investments resulting from the 349 million in proceeds of our initial public offering 

  

other expense other expense comprised mainly of vat expenses was 03 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and relatively constant at 01 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 

  

income tax provision benefit the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2006 was 65 million or 1795 of the pretax income this differs from the federal statutory rate of 34 primarily for the following reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2005 was 366 for additional information see note 9 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

cumulative effect of applying sab 108 in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 sab 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying missatatements in current year financial statements in connection with the adoption of sab 108 effective january 1 2006 we corrected our financial statements for the cumulative effect of certain prior period errors by decreasing accumulated deficit and accounts payable as of the sab 108 adoption date by 033 million these errors had resulted from the duplicate recording of certain inventory costs in 2003 2004 and 2005 in addition an error resulting from unrecorded stock grants in 2000 and 2001 was corrected by increasing accumulated deficit and common stock as of the sab 108 adoption date by 027 million we used our historical method for evaluating materiality prior to the adoption of sab 108 and determined that these errors were not material to the financial statements for any of the prior periods 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2006 we had working capital of 770 million including cash and cash equivalents of 508 million and shortterm investments of 277 million compared to working capital of 655 million including cash and cash equivalents of 251 million shortterm investments of 388 million and restricted cash of 29 million as of december 31 2005 we financed our growth primarily with proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock the exercise of stock options and cash generated from operating activities in november 2004 we received total proceeds of 349 million net of related issuance fees and offering costs from our initial public offering 

  

for the year ended december 31 2006 net cash provided by operating activities of 118 million was primarily due to changes in working capital in the amount of 115 million net cash provided by operating activities was 172 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 90 million for the year ended december 31 2004 cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was primarily from increased revenues and related margin contributions 

  

for the year ended december 31 2006 net cash generated from investing activities was 66 million primarily due to net proceeds from our investments in the amount of 111 million and releasing a restriction on our cash in the amount of 29 million cash that was previously restricted as collateral to a surety bond that we have outstanding as a result of our litigation with o2 micro is no longer restricted these amounts were offset by capital purchases of 75 million primarily related to our facility in chengdu and the ramping up of our research and development activities 

  

for the year ended december 31 2005 we used 266 million in investing activities as compared to 245 million for the year ended december 31 2004 for the year ended december 31 2005 we had net proceeds from sale of shortterm investments of 1722 million which was offset by purchases of shortterm investments of 1941 million for the year ended december 31 2005 we purchased 19 million of capital equipment 

  

we use professional investment management firms to manage the majority of our invested cash within the us the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds outside of the us our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in us treasury notes and other sovereign obligations and highly rated corporate notes the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes all investments are made according to guidelines and policies approved by the board of directors 

  

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 73 million primarily from the proceeds related to the exercise of options and warrants in the amount of 41 million proceeds from the purchase of stock through our employee stock purchase plan in the amount of 12 million excess tax benefits related to the exercise of options in the amount of 16 million and the repayment of a stockholder note in the amount of 04 million 

  

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was 27 million compared to 357 million for the year ended december 31 2004 for the year ended december 31 2005 we generated cash from financing activities primarily through proceeds of 21 million from the exercise of stock options and warrants and 06 million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2004 was 357 million primarily from our initial public offering which increased our cash by 349 million net of offering expenses 

  

although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above we believe that cash generated from operations together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months for further details regarding our operating investing and financing activities see the consolidated statement of cash flows 

  

contractual obligation and off balance sheet arrangements 

  

in december 2006 we relocated our corporate headquarters from los gatos california to san jose california and wrote off the fair value of the lease in the amount of 13 million we lease our headquarters and sales offices in san jose california under a noncancelable operating lease which expires in october 2009 certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases in addition we entered into a fiveyear lease arrangement in 2004 for our manufacturing facility located in chengdu china we also lease sales offices in japan china taiwan and korea total obligations under these leases are included in the table below 

  

we outsource the production of wafers to a third party foundry the agreement with the foundry provides for threemonth production forecasts we have committed to purchase any wafers under a threemonth production forecast once production has begun as of december 31 2006 these purchase commitments were 93 million 

  

in september 2004 we signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to construct a facility in chengdu china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to this agreement we agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 50 million to our whollyowned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital for the subsidiary and exercised the option to purchase land use rights for the facility of approximately 02 million we also have the option to acquire the facility after a fiveyear lease term for the original construction cost less rents paid which is currently estimated at 22 million 

  

as of december 31 2006 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements or activities outside of operating leases and non cancelable purchase orders other than those discussed above the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements at december 31 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years in thousands 

  

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk primarily interest rate and credit risk our investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us such guidelines include security type credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively shortterm maturities 

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio investment debt securities are classified as availableforsale and no gains or losses are recognized by us in our results of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity these investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains being included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes in 2006 the primary functional currency of the company’s offshore operations was the local currency primarily the new taiwan dollar and the chinese yuan to date fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend   

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

as of december 31 2006 under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2006 to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act 1 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and 2 is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15df our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

  

our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

a control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a significant deficiency is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects the company’s ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is a more than remote likelihood that a misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 in performing this assessment management used the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—an integrated framework 

  

based upon this assessment our management has concluded that as of december 31 2006 our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm deloitte  touche llp which audited the financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has issued an attestation report included elsewhere herein on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

in response to the material weaknesses that we reported in our form 10k filed with the sec on march 28 2006 we made the following changes that have materially affected our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

based on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2006 we have fully remediated the material weaknesses previously described in our periodic reports including our form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 and our quarterly reports for the threemonth periods ended march 31 2006 june 30 2006 and september 30 2006 

  

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  

while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance that their respective objectives will be met we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors and all fraud any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks

 item 1 business tableend general 

monolithic power systems inc together with its consolidated subsidiaries “mps” or the “company” is a high performance analog and mixedsignal semiconductor company we design develop and market proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors for large and high growth markets our semiconductors or integrated circuits ics are used in a variety of electronic products such as notebook computers flat panel displays cellular handsets digital cameras wireless local area network lan access points home entertainment systems and personal digital assistants the company competes on its ability to offer deep systemlevel and applications knowledge strong analog and mixedsignal design expertise and low cost and high performance products through our proprietary process technology for the design and manufacture of our ics 

industry overview 

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified as either discrete devices such as individual transistors or ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic 

  

circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for ‘high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics ‘high performance’ includes integration of higher levels of functionality into a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixedsignal ic market from digital ic markets these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 products and applications 

we currently have four standard product families that address multiple applications within the computing consumer and communications markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

liquid crystal display lcd backlight inverter ics lcd backlight inverter ics are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebooks lcd monitors car navigational systems and more recently lcd televisions these ics function by converting low voltage direct current dc or battery voltage to high voltage alternating current ac we believe our lcd backlight inverter ics were the first to utilize a full bridge resonant topology that allows for high efficiency extended lifetimes for cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfls and lower signal interference with adjacent components the full bridge topology is now industry standard for these products we also believe that our lcd backlight inverter ics are the semiconductor industry’s only backlight inverter ics with four fullyintegrated power devices this integration reduces the overall size total solution part count and cost for our customers our lcd product family encompasses all of the products that we formerly referred to as our ccfl product family as well as other nonccfl solutions for lcd backlight inverters 

direct current dc to dc converter ics dc to dc converter ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points home appliances automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc converters are differentiated particularly with respect to their high degree of integration and rapid switching speeds these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components smaller form factors more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system costs through the elimination of discrete power devices 

light emitting diode led driver ics led driver ics are used in lighting displays and can be used in small portable devices such as color cellular handsets personal digital assistants global positioning systems and electronic gaming systems as well as in emerging applications such as traffic lights and automobile signal lights we were one of the first companies to offer led driver ics with a protection feature that limits damage to a system in the event of a poor connection we believe that our led driver ics are differentiated in the market with respect to their small size power efficiency and costeffectiveness 

audio amplifier ics audio amplifier ics are used to amplify sound produced by audio processors we currently offer class d audio amplifiers which are wellsuited for applications that are particularly sensitive to both size and power efficiency such as plasma televisions lcd televisions and dvd players with today’s systems becoming smaller and utilizing larger amounts of power solution sizes and the management of heat dissipation are becoming increasingly important to overall system design the high degree of power efficiency and small form factor provided by our class d audio amplifiers allows system vendors to significantly reduce heat dissipation 

  

eliminating the costly and sizable fans and heat sinks traditionally required by audio amplifier ics these features enable our customers to achieve their objectives without sacrificing sound quality 

we currently target the computing consumer electronics and wireless markets of these three markets the computing market represents the largest portion of our revenues as we continue to expand our product portfolio and addressable markets and as other end markets in which we participate continue to grow we expect that our revenues from the computing market may decline as a percentage of our total revenues over time the following chart is a brief summary of our portfolio solution for various applications for each of these applications we either are currently shipping product or have design wins which are decisions by oems or odms to use our ics 

 

 customers sales and marketing 

we market our products through distribution arrangements and through our direct sales organization to oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and electronic manufacturing service providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers in 2004 our largest direct customers were asian information technology ait and uppertech accounting for 28 and 21 of our net revenues respectively our current distribution agreements with ait and uppertech provide that each distributor shall each have the nonexclusive right to sell and each agrees to use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in china taiwan and hong kong that each agreement may be terminated by either us or the distributor on three months’ notice and that payment shall occur within 30 days from the end of the month in which we deliver the product neither agreement includes price protection provisions original design manufacturers electronic manufacturing service providers and other third parties under distribution arrangements are not end customers but rather serve as a channel to many end users of our products while other end users of our products purchase from us directly 

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china and korea because our products typically require a highly technical sales effort we are planning to expand our base of sales and applications support personnel worldwide for example in 2005 we expect to expand or complete the opening of additional sales offices in the united states japan and europe information about our revenues and longlived assets in different geographic regions of the world is provided in note 15 to the financial statements 

because our sales are billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are not directly subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because 989 of our revenues in 2004 were attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers who manufacture their products in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products 

  

we generally warrant our products for 90 days from shipment and for longer periods in certain cases historical warranty expense as a percentage of revenues has been negligible 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers that have not yet shipped our backlog at december 31 2004 was 86 million as order lead times may vary and as industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future sales and our quarterly revenues also depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter because our manufacturing lead times are generally 6 to 14 weeks we often must build in advance of customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that expected sales will not materialize leading to excess inventory if we have excess inventory we would expect to either sell it at a substantial discount or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

research and development 

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design expertise through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets examples of our intellectual property and knowhow include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits and expertise in mixedsignal integration 

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas system architectures circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of system architectures we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products developing more standard cells and libraries improving our device structures and adding new features to our products for example we are currently working to expand our product portfolio into new products areas such as operational amplifiers 

we have developed a proprietary process technology that is applicable across a wide range of analog and mixedsignal products we intend to continue to invest in our process technology to further refine this technology with respect to overall chip size and power handling capabilities as appropriate in the future we may also expand our base of process technologies but only if these technologies are costeffective and enable us to further expand our product offerings beyond what is currently achievable 

research and development expenses were approximately 77 million 55 million and 45 million in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively which excludes stockbased compensation of 52 million 11 million and 6900 respectively 

patents and intellectual property matters 

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies for manufacturing our products our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of march 1 2005 we have 13 issued united states and foreign patents and 61 united states and foreign applications on file our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success our issued us patents are due to expire between 2018 and 2023 we also rely on a 

  

combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we have entered into a patent license agreement with another integrated circuit company pursuant to which we have granted this company a license with certain limited sublicense rights under certain of our patents to make use and sell certain of this company’s own integrated circuit products for a period of two years and for which this company is obligated to pay us royalties based on sales of those products we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not to date registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation with o2 linear microsemi and micrel for a more complete description of our legal matters please read “legal proceedings” beginning on page 23 patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management’s resources further we have agreed to indemnify our customers and supplier in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or supplier or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

manufacturing 

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technology on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields for our integrated circuits 

we currently contract with advanced semiconductor manufacturing corporation of shanghai “asmc” to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped either to third party subcontractors or to our facilities in los gatos california for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in malaysia china and thailand the assembled ics are then forwarded for final testing primarily at our los gatos facilities prior to shipping to our customers 

  

we have signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to establish a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to the agreement we have agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 5 million to a wholly owned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital of the subsidiary pursuant to the agreement the local authorities have agreed to pay for design and build our plant and related infrastructure based on our specifications we have agreed to buy the plant five years after completion for the actual cost of construction which is anticipated to be under 1 million we expect the facility to become operational in the fourth quarter of 2005 at which point we hope to realize several improvements in our business model in the near term we expect to experience an immediate reduction in testing and shipping costs due to lower labor and facility costs and significantly shorter transportation distances in the intermediate to long term we hope to expand our product testing capabilities in our china facility and be positioned to be able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support operations 

key personnel and employees 

the company’s performance is substantially dependent on the performance of its executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater aptitude for analog and mixedsignal design engineers with such skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would harm the business the success of the company depends on its ability to identify hire train develop and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel as of december 31 2004 we had 154 employees located in the united states taiwan china and korea of these employees approximately 40 were involved in research and development 

competition 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products micrel incorporated microsemi corporation national semiconductor corporation o2 micro international semtech corporation stmicroelectronic and texas instruments 

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive with respect to these factors particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than competitive products however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market 

trends risks and uncertainties 

our business is inherently risky you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10ka and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 

  

we have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 

we have incurred losses on an annual basis since our inception as of december 31 2004 we had an accumulated deficit of 202 million we expect to incur significant operating expenses over the next several years in connection with the continued development and expansion of our business our operating expenses include general and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses litigation expenses stock based compensation expenses and research and development expenses relating to products that will not be introduced and will not generate revenues until later periods if at all we may not achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 

if we are unsuccessful in our current lawsuits with o2 micro international limited in either the us or in taiwan we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages or fines any unfavorable outcome would cause our revenues in the lcd backlight product family to decline significantly and severely harm our business and operating results 

this risk factor only summarizes the various legal proceedings and related events we strongly advise you to read “ legal proceedings ” beginning on page 23 for a more detailed description 

we are engaged in multiple legal proceedings with o2 micro inc and its parent corporation o2 micro international limited we refer to o2 micro and o2 micro international together as o2 these proceedings involve various claims and counterclaims in the united states and taiwan by o2 and us alleging among other things patent infringements and misappropriation of trade secrets all of which relate to our ccfl backlight inverter ics which are part of our lcd backlight inverter product family o2 has obtained an injunction in taiwan prohibiting us from manufacturing designing displaying importing or selling two of our most significant products in taiwan either directly or through a third party acting at our request the patent dispute in both the united states and the taiwanese litigation involves issues that could affect all of our ccfl backlight inverter products used in the united states and taiwan o2 has also taken legal action against our wafer manufacturer and some of our customers and users of our products in the united states and taiwan if we are not successful in our litigation with o2 we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages to o2 andor our customers if we are found to be in violation of the taiwan injunction or liable to o2 on its claims against us we could also be prevented from selling many of our products either into taiwan directly or through the distribution arrangements we currently employ or in the us because we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and manufacturer against patent infringement claims and we are currently defending our manufacturer and one of our customers against claim by o2 we could be liable to our manufacturer or customers who have purchased our products and whom we have indemnified against liability for damages arising from claims by o2 or others that our products infringe patents of o2 or others our customers and endusers of our products could decide not to use our products or our wafer manufacturer could decide to reduce or eliminate its manufacturing of the related lcd backlight inverter product family in an attempt to avoid litigation with o2 or our products or their accounts payable to us could be seized from them 

a significant portion of our expected future revenues over the next several years is expected to come from users of our lcd backlight product family in taiwan any of the outcomes described above would have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations for one or more quarters and any injunction that prohibits us from selling significant products for any length of time would have an immediate and drastic negative effect on our business and results of operations depending on the scope and severity of those claims any injunctions that may be issued against us or fines andor damages that we may to pay could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are unsuccessful in our current patent infringement lawsuits with linear technology corporation microsemi corporation or micrel incorporated we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages or fines any unfavorable outcome would cause our revenues to decline significantly and severely harm our business and operating results 

this risk factor only summarizes the various legal proceedings and related events we strongly advise you to read “legal proceedings” beginning on page 23 for a more detailed description 

in july 2004 linear technology corporation “linear” filed a complaint with the us international trade commission itc alleging that two of our products the mp1556 a product within our dc to dc converter product family and the ev0063 the evaluation board containing the mp1556 infringe its us patent nos 

  

5481178 and 6580258 linear has subsequently supplemented its infringement allegations to include certain additional products and products under development linear’s complaint requests that the itc issue an exclusion order and a cease and desist order that would prevent products utilizing the circuitry in question from being imported into the us sales of our products identified by linear in its complaint accounted for less than 2 of our revenues for 2004 however if linear successfully adds other products to its complaint then the potential financial impact on the company could be much greater our dc to dc converter products are expected to account for a significant portion of our future revenues over the next several years 

in october 2004 microsemi corporation “microsemi” sued us in the united states district court for the central district of california alleging that our products infringe four of its patents microsemi’s complaint does not identify which claims in the four patents are allegedly infringed nor does it identify which of our products supposedly infringe the patent claims we have filed an answer and counterclaim denying infringement and seeking a declaration that we do not infringe the patents andor that the patents are invalid based upon the description of the technology contained in microsemi’s complaint and responses to our discovery requests we understand that microsemi will contend that one or more of our ccfl backlight inverter products infringes its patents the complaint requests an injunction to prevent us from allegedly infringing the patents as well as unspecified damages attorneys’ fees costs and expenses 

in november 2004 micrel incorporated “micrel” sued us in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging that our products infringe two of its patents michael hsing our chief executive officer and another of our employees are named inventors on both of micrel’s patents and jim moyer our chief design engineer is a named inventor on one of them micrel’s complaint does not identify which claims in the two patents are allegedly infringed nor does it identify which of our products supposedly infringe the patent claims however because micrel’s patents relate to semiconductor manufacturing processes and semiconductor design elements rather than a specific device all of our products could potentially be implicated micrel’s complaint requests an injunction to prevent us from allegedly infringing the patents as well as unspecified damages attorneys’ fees costs and expenses 

if we do not prevail in the linear litigation the microsemi litigation or the micrel litigation we could be enjoined from selling one or more of our products into the us either directly or indirectly because many of our products are sold indirectly by our customers back into the us a us injunction covering one or more of our products would likely substantially reduce sales of those products in addition if we do not prevail in the microsemi or micrel litigation we could be ordered to pay monetary damages to microsemi andor micrel we could also be liable to customers who have purchased our products and whom we have indemnified against liability for damages arising from claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others even if we are ultimately successful in the litigation with linear microsemi and micrel we could lose customers in the interim due to the surrounding uncertainty any of these results would have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations for one or more quarters and any injunction that prohibits us from selling significant products for any length of time would have an immediate and drastic negative effect on our business and results of operations 

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our litigations our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our predictions with respect to any given quarter 

as described in “management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations— overview—patent litigation” until our litigations with o2 linear microsemi and micrel are resolved we will continue to incur substantial legal expenses that vary with the level of activity in the legal proceedings this level of activity is not entirely within our control as we may need to respond to legal actions by o2 linear microsemi or micrel consequently we may find it difficult to predict the legal expenses for any given quarter which will impair our ability to forecast our results of operations for that quarter it is likely that these expenses will increase leading up to and during our o2 trial scheduled for may 2005 the o2sumida trial scheduled for june 2005 and linear trial scheduled for june 2005 interim developments in these lawsuits may also contribute to increased volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of those developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in addition along with the claims asserted by o2 linear microsemi and micrel these or other third parties could assert that these or other of our products infringe their intellectual property rights which could result in restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of our products andor cause us to pay license fees and damages 

  

interim developments in our various legal proceedings may contribute to increased volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of those developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in the litigations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation matters with o2 linear microsemi and micrel patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims such litigation is very costly and may divert our management’s resources our management team could also be required to devote so much time effort and energy to the legal proceedings that the rest of our business suffers for example we spent 78 million or 165 of revenue in 2004 on patent litigation expenses and we expect patent litigation expenses to increase in absolute dollars in 2005 further we have agreed to indemnify our customers and supplier in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling some or potentially all of our products or could be required to indemnify our customers or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if we were unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our products so that they did not infringe or stop selling the infringing products which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we do not expect to sustain our recent growth rate 

due primarily to increased sales of our ccfl backlight inverter product family which are now part of our lcd backlight inverter product family and our dc to dc converter product family we have experienced significant revenue growth and have gained significant market share in relatively a short period of time specifically our annual revenues increased from 122 million in 2002 to 242 million in 2003 to 476 million in 2004 however we do not expect similar revenue growth or market share gains in the future periods accordingly you should not rely on results of any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance 

due to our limited operating history we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenues and appropriately budgeting for our expenses 

we were incorporated in 1997 and did not begin generating meaningful revenues until 2000 as a result we have only a short history from which to predict future revenues our limited operating experience combined with the rapidly evolving nature of the markets into which we sell our products as well as other factors which are beyond our control reduces our ability to accurately forecast quarterly or annual revenues we are currently expanding our staffing and increasing our expense levels in anticipation of future revenue growth if our revenues do not increase as anticipated significant losses could result due to our higher expense levels 

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline 

our revenues expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control for example our revenues for the first quarter of each year tend to be significantly less than the revenues for the last quarter of the previous year we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand production capacity and rapid erosion of average selling prices although the semiconductor industry has recently experienced strong demand the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in pricing pressure on our products as well as lower demand for our products because a significant portion of our expenses is fixed in the short term or is incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales this could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenues will decrease 

we believe that applications of our products in the computer consumer electronics and wireless markets will continue to account for a majority of our revenues in addition within these markets we are dependent upon a small number of products we are particularly dependent on the computing market including notebook and flat panel monitor applications and we expect that a significant level of our revenues and operating results will continue to be dependent upon notebook and flat panel monitor applications for at least the near term if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenues will decrease 

we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

we market our products through distribution arrangements and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include original equipment manufacturers original design manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers receivables from our customers are not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 

in addition in 2003 ctp yosun and ambitunique logistics third parties with whom we currently have or formerly had distribution arrangements accounted for 30 16 and 14 of our revenues respectively we terminated our distribution arrangement with ctp in march 2004 and entered into expanded distribution agreements with asian information technology or ait and uppertech in 2004 ait uppertech and yosun each of which is a distributor accounted for 28 21 and 9 of our revenues respectively any future termination or loss of a distribution arrangement could reduce customers’ willingness or ability to purchase our products and could thereby reduce our revenues and adversely affect our future operating results 

we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to longterm supply contracts the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our operations and financial condition for example revenues from our audio amplifier product family declined from 140 of total revenues in 2002 to 13 of total revenues in 2003 the decline was due to the loss of one major customer who placed a large nonrecurring order in the third and fourth quarters of 2002 

  

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a small number of end customer original equipment manufacturers or oems such as dell hewlettpackard ibm and sony although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor original design manufacturers to use our products we do not have agreements with any of these end customers formal or informal therefore there can be no assurance that they will continue to choose to incorporate our ics into their products we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics 

we have recently had to improve our internal accounting systems and controls and if we fail to make continued improvements our business may suffer 

our reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future as we have been an early stage private company we have had limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures as a result when we prepared our financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2003 we identified and reported to our audit committee three significant deficiencies in our internal accounting controls two of these significant deficiencies rose to the level of “material weaknesses” while the third was considered a “reportable condition” the two material weaknesses were that i we lacked certain formalized accounting policies and procedures including written procedures for the monthly quarterly and annual “closing” of our financial books and records and ii we lacked sufficient staff in our accounting and information technology departments the reportable condition was that our accounting personnel lacked adequate training on our enterprise resource planning system subsequently we consulted with our audit committee and undertook remedial steps to address these deficiencies including hiring additional staff training our new and existing staff and establishing monthly quarterly and annual closing procedures 

we believe that we have remediated the material weaknesses and reportable conditions in our internal controls as identified in connection with the preparation of our fiscal 2003 financial statements at the direction of our audit committee we engaged our external auditors to audit our financial statements for the quarter ended march 31 2004 which audit did not include an audit of internal control over financial reporting in their report to the audit committee following this audit the material weaknesses and reportable condition previously identified were no longer reported however other matters that did not constitute material weaknesses or reportable conditions were identified these other matters included control deficiency recommendations relating to 

 

  

  

  

 in response to these recommendations we will be transferring an internal employee to the position of financial planning and analysis this transfer will take effect once we hire a replacement to fill this employee’s current position of compliance and sec reporting we anticipate hiring this replacement in early april 2005 we have implemented the other recommendations relating to cost accounting and other reserve accrual and closing procedures in connection with our june 30 and september 30 2004 quarterly closes and our 2004 yearend audit we have also completed documentation of our information security policies these other control deficiencies did not have a material impact on our financial statements and as they all have now been addressed are not expected to have any future material impact on our financial statements if however we fail to continue to adequately staff our accounting and finance function and maintain internal controls adequate to meet the demands that will be placed upon us as a public company including the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our business may suffer 

  

standards for compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 are uncertain and if we fail to comply in a timely manner our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline 

we must comply with the rules promulgated under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 section 404 by december 31 2005 we expect to incur additional administrative expense as we implement section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act which requires management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our internal controls in addition the nasdaq national market on which our common stock is listed has also adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations these new or changed laws regulations and standards are also subject to varying interpretations in many cases and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices we cannot be certain that we will comply with the requirements of section 404 or other requirements in a timely manner if we fail to comply in a timely manner public perception of our internal controls could be damaged causing our financial results to suffer and our stock price to decline 

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business 

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent upon the continued services of michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology also personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees our business could be harmed 

we currently depend on one thirdparty supplier to provide us with wafers for our products if our wafer supplier fails to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenues and gross margins may decline 

we have a supply arrangement with asmc for the production of wafers although certain aspects of our relationship with asmc are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on their continued cooperation we began this relationship with asmc in 2001 and commenced volume production at asmc’s facilities in the first half of 2003 in october 2004 o2 sued asmc for patent infringement based on its manufacture of our products and it is possible that our relationship with asmc could be materially and adversely affected by the o2 litigation 

in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be nonfunctional thereby reducing yields the failure of asmc to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenues 

although we provide asmc with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity of the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause asmc to reduce capacity available to us asmc may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customers’ requirements if asmc extends lead times limits supplies or increases prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenues and gross margins may decline 

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice we are required under our agreement with asmc to order wafers at least three months in advance if we cancel these orders after asmc’s commencement of manufacturing which generally occurs six to fourteen weeks before scheduled delivery of the wafers we must pay cancellation fees to asmc if our customers cancel orders after we have ordered the corresponding wafers from asmc we may be forced to incur cancellation fees or to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a small percentage of our testing is performed by thirdparty subcontractors we do not have any ongoing agreements with these subcontractors as a result we may not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue protecting our proprietary technology including through patents there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from direct or indirect sales to foreign customers and have significant foreign operations which may expose us to political regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from direct or indirect sales to foreign customers including 989 for 2004 from sales either directly or through distribution arrangements to parties located in asia a majority of which represents revenues from parties with whom we have distribution arrangements for resale to users of our products in taiwan as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this concentration of business and operations there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive government regulation and may receive the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

most of our manufacturing partners including asmc our current foundry are located in china in addition we are currently in the process of establishing a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to the facility we are establishing in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

for example pursuant to our agreement to establish the facility in chengdu china the local authorities have agreed to pay for design and build our plant and related infrastructure based on our specifications we have agreed to buy the plant five years after completion for the actual cost of construction prior to the plant purchase we have agreed to make quarterly lease payments which will ultimately be applied against the construction costs due at the end of the five years the local authorities have agreed to ensure that we will obtain all necessary licenses for doing business that we will obtain favorable tax treatment similar to other foreign technology companies and that we will obtain our land use rights additionally we will not require an export license and upon approval by the applicable authorities will be exempt from certain import valueadded taxes and custom duties if at the end of five years we elect not to purchase the plant then the agreement will terminated and the local authorities can take back title to the plant revoke our land use rights and will refund our land purchase price however the local authority will retain all lease payments if any of these terms or incentives is reduced altered or eliminated the profitability of our china facility could be harmed and overall our revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

we operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to develop new technologies or to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenues andor a loss of market share to competitors 

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

to the extent that we fail to introduce new products or penetrate new markets our revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenues and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures must be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process which averages 6 to 12 months requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional 3 to 6 months after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons 

 

  

  

  

 as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenues because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenues the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

our products must meet exacting specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenues increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

we intend to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

we plan to expand our operations domestically and internationally and may do so through internal growth strategic relationships or acquisitions including but not limited to the establishment of a testing facility in china we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financing and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with several domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include intersil corporation linear maxim integrated products micrel microsemi national semiconductor corporation o2 semtech corporation stmicroelectronic and texas instruments we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market 

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

our current backlog may not be indicative of future sales 

due to the nature of our business in which order lead times may vary and customers are generally allowed to reschedule or cancel orders on short notice we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future sales our quarterly revenues also depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter because lead times for the manufacturing of our products generally take 6 to 8 weeks we often must build in advance of orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that expected sales will not materialize leading to excess inventory which we may be unable to sell to other customers therefore our backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future sales 

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer supplier a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenues as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in southeast asia such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories like sudden acute respiratory syndrome or bird flu could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities and we may be unable to successfully integrate these companies into our operations which would adversely affect our business 

as a part of our business strategy we expect to review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other growth opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership andor incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities such actions by us could impact our operating results andor the price of our common stock 

  

in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business 

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market in general often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

if securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could harm the market price of our stock 

if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of common stock in the public market soon after the lockup period ends the market price of our common stock could fall as of december 31 2004 we had outstanding 7785825 freely tradable shares of common stock another 19693392 shares will be eligible for sale in the public market on may 18 2005 which is 180 days from the date of our initial public offering on november 18 2004 all of which are subject to lockup agreements with us andor the underwriters either we or the underwriters 

  

may in our respective sole discretion and at any time without notice release all or any portion of the securities from the restrictions imposed by our respective lockup agreements with security holders prior to the expiration of such 180day period additionally 261324 shares are restricted securities that will become eligible for sale in the public market pursuant to rule 144 at various dates in the future the sale of a significant number of these shares could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

because of their significant stock ownership our officers and directors will be able to exert significant influence over our future direction 

executive officers directors and affiliated entities beneficially own in aggregate approximately 362 of our outstanding common stock additionally jim jones one of our directors is associated with bavp lp which owns approximately 83 of our outstanding common stock these stockholders if acting together would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend o2 micro inc 

overview 

since november 2000 we have been engaged in multiple legal proceedings against o2 micro inc “o2 micro” and its parent corporation o2 micro international limited “o2 international” we refer to o2 micro and o2 international together as “o2” these proceedings involve various claims and counterclaims in the united states and taiwan by us and o2 alleging patent infringements and misappropriation of trade secrets all of which relate to our ccfl backlight inverter product family although the taiwanese injunction against us specifically named only our mp 1011a and mp 1015 products within that product family the underlying patent dispute involves issues that could affect all of our ccfl backlight inverter products that are used in taiwan in 2004 revenues from our ccfl backlight inverter product family were 219 million or 460 of total revenue of which products used in taiwan represented a significant portion of our revenues in 2004 o2 has also sued a number of other companies in the us and taiwan for patent infringement including purchasers andor users of certain of our products and our wafer manufacturer all of these legal proceedings pose various degrees of risk to our business 

regardless of the extent to which these legal actions have been successful or not successful the legal expenses associated with the various actions in the us and taiwan have been high and have had a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations” for more detail on the financial impact these legal actions have had on us 

patents at issue 

the various litigations arise from patents issued to o2 and us covering products that compete with each other 

  

our patents our patents at issue are i us patent no 6114814 issued to us on november 5 2000 and relating to inverter ics for lcd display products which include for example our ccfl backlight inverter product family “the ‘814 patent” and ii us patent no 6316881 “the ‘881 patent” a continuation of the ‘814 patent that issued to us on november 13 2001 

o2’s patents the o2 patents at issue are i us patent no 6259615 b1 issued to o2 international on july 10 2001 and also relating to inverter ics for lcd display products “the ‘615 patent” ii us patent no 6396722 “the ‘722 patent” a continuation of the ‘615 patent that issued to o2 on may 28 2002 iii us patent no 6804129 “the ‘129 patent” a continuation of the ‘615 and ‘722 patents that issued to o2 on october 12 2004 and iv taiwan patent no 152318 issued to o2 international on march 1 2002 which is a counterpart to the ‘615 patent “the ‘318 patent” o2’s original applications for its us ‘615 patent and its taiwan ‘318 patent were substantially similar but some of o2’s claims contained in the ‘318 patent were rejected by the us patent and trademark office and accordingly the us patent was narrowed significantly before issuance the taiwan patent however was not similarly narrowed and was issued in the broader form originally requested 

us litigation 

various us lawsuits between o2 and us have been consolidated in the us district court for the northern district of california o2 has i claimed that we interfered with o2’s prospective economic advantage and disrupted o2’s customer relationships by misrepresenting the scope of our ‘814 patent ii asked the court to declare that o2 does not infringe our ‘814 patent and that our ‘814 patent is invalid iii claimed that our products infringe its ‘615 patent and iv claimed that we misappropriated its trade secrets we have i claimed that o2’s products infringe our ‘814 and ‘881 patents and ii asked the court to declare that o2’s ‘615 patent is invalid or not enforceable or that our products do not infringe o2’s ‘615 patent each party denied the allegations in the other party’s complaints and sought damages and an injunction prohibiting the other party from selling its products 

in february 2004 and may 2004 the court ruled on these matters as follows i granting summary judgment for us that our products do not infringe the ‘615 patent ii dismissing o2’s claim that we interfered with o2’s economic advantage iii denying o2’s motion for summary judgment that o2’s products do not infringe our ‘814 and ‘881 patents or that those patents are invalid and iv denying both parties’ motions for summary judgment on o2’s trade secret claims we expect o2 to eventually appeal one or more of these rulings to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit o2 could wait to file any such appeal until conclusion of the trial or could ask the trial judge to allow an earlier appeal prior to the trial 

the claims remaining after these rulings include i o2’s trade secret claims and ii our infringement claims for injunctive relief only and not for damages trial on these matters is currently scheduled for may 2005 while we believe that our ‘814 and ‘881 patents are valid and that we have not misappropriated any of o2’s trade secrets a court could find differently if the court finds that our ‘814 and ‘881 patents are invalid our competitive position would be severely harmed if the court finds that we have misappropriated o2’s trade secrets we could be liable for damages to o2 andor be enjoined from further misappropriation or use of the alleged trade secrets any award of damages could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 

in addition if o2 appeals the rulings in our favor we will at a minimum continue to incur substantial legal expense contesting any such appeal if o2 were to be successful on any such appeals o2’s claims would be remanded for further proceedings potentially including trial if the court were to find that our products infringe the ‘615 patent we could be liable to o2 for damages and could be enjoined from selling our products in the us any such injunction would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations at least for several quarters and possibly for a much longer period of time depending on the extent of any such damage award and the scope and applicability of any such injunction if the court found that we have interfered with o2’s economic advantage we could be liable for damages to o2 which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 

in january 2003 o2 filed a lawsuit against sumida corp and taiwan sumida electronics inc in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that sumida’s use of our products in sumida’s products infringes the ‘615 and ‘722 patents we have agreed to assume the defense of sumida pursuant to an indemnity agreement that case has been set for trial for june 2005 

in response to o2’s action against sumida in may 2004 we filed a complaint against o2 in the us district court for the northern district of california seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe o2’s 

  

‘722 patent that case has been assigned to the same judge presiding over the litigation over the ‘615 ‘814 and ‘881 patents described above but it has not been consolidated with the earlier case in october 2004 o2 filed a counterclaim for alleged infringement of the ‘722 patent and added our foundry advanced semiconductor manufacturing corporation of shanghai “asmc” as a counterclaim defendant because the litigation is in a very preliminary stage it is difficult to predict how it will proceed or what the ultimate outcome will be no trial date has yet been set in this matter 

on or about october 12 2004 o2 filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the eastern district of texas for alleged infringement of the ‘129 patent we have filed an answer and an antitrust and unfair competition counterclaim against o2 because the litigation is in a very preliminary stage it is difficult to predict how it will proceed or what the ultimate outcome will be 

if the california court were to find that our products infringe the ‘722 patent or if a court were to find that our products infringe the ‘129 patent we could be liable to o2 for damages and could be enjoined from selling our products in the us any such injunction would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations at least for several quarters and possibly for a much longer period of time depending on the extent of any such damage award and the scope and applicability of any such injunction 

taiwan litigation 

summary in addition to the us litigation described above o2 has brought legal proceedings against us in taiwan based upon its ‘318 patent unlike the us where a party seeking a preliminary injunction must first file a lawsuit on the merits of the underlying claim in taiwan it is possible for a party to be granted a preliminary injunction without first filing a lawsuit on the merits in january 2003 upon o2’s request the shihlin district court in taiwan issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing designing displaying importing or selling our mp1011a and mp1015 products in taiwan either directly or through a third party acting at our request 

we believe that we have at all times conducted our business in compliance with the injunction nevertheless o2 has attempted repeatedly various actions to persuade the court that we have violated it the court has not yet issued a ruling on o2’s motion we have also taken several legal actions in an attempt to have the injunction lifted andor to have o2’s ‘318 patent declared invalid these actions include appealing the shihlin district court’s injunction initiating proceedings with the taiwan intellectual property office tipo to invalidate o2’s ‘318 patent and seeking counterinjunctions from the taipei district court some of those actions have produced legal outcomes in our favor and others have not but none has yet resulted in the lifting of the injunction or the invalidation of o2’s patent we intend to continue pursuing the available legal avenues to achieve these objectives 

in june 2003 o2 filed a lawsuit against us in the shihlin district court for a resolution on the merits of o2’s claim that our products infringe o2’s ‘318 patent that lawsuit was dismissed in april 2004 but o2 filed a similar lawsuit in taipei district court shortly thereafter 

in august 2004 the tipo issued a letter ordering o2 to amend its ‘318 patent the tipo letter indicated that two of the three independent claims asserted by o2 lacked inventive steps and therefore should be amended or deleted by o2 as to the third independent claim the tipo indicated that certain corrections should be made but has not at this time indicated that the third independent claim should be amended or deleted in december 2004 o2 filed its amendment on its ‘318 patent and we have responded with our comments on its amendment in february 2005 tipo has not made a decision on whether o2’s amendment is adequate if following such correction the third claim is upheld by the tipo such claim could be sufficient for o2 to continue its patent claims against us in july 2004 the taiwan supreme court issued a ruling that remanded our motion for a retrial of o2’s preliminary injunction against us to the taiwan high court in that ruling the taiwan supreme court indicated that in order for o2 to be entitled to sue for or seek injunctions relating to infringement of its patents under taiwan patent law it must be demonstrated whether o2’s country of incorporation the cayman islands offers similar reciprocal protections to taiwanese individuals and entities under its patent law the court has not yet ruled on this issue 

our counterinjunctions against o2 we have obtained two defensive counterinjunctions from the taipei district court the first of which prohibits o2 from interfering with our or other parties’ use of our mp 1011a and mp1015 products the second injunction prohibits o2 from interfering with the manufacture sale use or importation by either us or a third party of a number of our other products which are specifically enumerated in the injunction although the mp1010b is not specifically addressed we posted cash bonds of approximately 61 

  

million including the 90000 bond discussed below with the taipei district court in connection with the two defensive preliminary injunctions these bonds are currently recorded as restricted assets on our balance sheet if we do not prevail at trial we might have to forfeit some or all of these bonds any such forfeiture would be an expense in the quarter in which the outcome of the trial is probable and reasonably estimable a forfeiture of any substantial part of the bonds would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position for that quarter 

o2’s other actions against us in august 2003 november 2003 and march 2004 o2 filed for provisional seizures against us in the shihlin district court and taipei district court which would entitle o2 to seize up to approximately 19 million of our assets in taiwan including but not limited to mp 1011a and mp 1015 parts this 19 million figure represents the amount of damages o2 has currently claimed in its taiwan patent infringement suit against us although at various times in the past o2 has claimed substantially higher damage amounts the court granted the provisional seizures the execution of the first provisional seizure was exempted because we posted a bond in the amount of approximately 90000 we elected not to post a bond to exempt the second and third provisional seizure orders and the court seized property from our taiwan office we have appealed the second and third provisional seizures to the supreme court one of our appeals involving the third seizure has been denied but the other appeal regarding the second seizure is still pending the second and third provisional seizure orders have not yet been executed to the satisfaction of o2’s demand and accordingly o2 may continue to request that the court seize our property under these orders o2 has applied for court orders allowing o2 to seize payments from our customers if such payments are made in taiwan to us the court has granted two such orders against two of our customers asustek and sumida but it is our understanding that o2 thus far has not been successful in seizing or attaching property of either of these customers the seized assets would be released to us upon the earlier to occur of i if and when the provisional seizure orders were to be revoked by the court or upon o2’s application or ii if and when the lawsuits on the merits filed by o2 were to be dismissed and such dismissal were final and conclusive however if o2 were to receive final judgment in its favor on the merits o2 would be able to file an application to sell the seized assets by auction to cover any damages that the court determines o2 to have suffered 

trial on the merits in taiwan we could lose at trial on the question of whether our products infringe o2’s ‘318 patent although o2 has named only our mp1011a and mp1015 products in its lawsuit if the court were to conclude that those products infringe the ‘318 patent the court could also conclude that many of our newer products including the 1010b and other ccfl products that are physically similar to the mp1011a andor the mp1015 infringe o2’s ‘318 patent we do not believe that the ‘318 patent is a valid patent or that any of our products infringe the ‘318 patent but a court may come to a different conclusion o2’s original applications for its us ‘615 patent and its taiwan ‘318 patent were substantially similar but some of o2’s claims contained in the ‘318 patent were rejected by the us patent and trademark office since the claims in the ‘318 patent are formulated more broadly than those of the ‘615 patent the summary judgment in the us that our products do not infringe the ‘615 patent may not be as helpful to us in the ‘318 case as it might be if the patents were identical 

if the court were to conclude that any of our products infringe the ‘318 patent and if the ‘318 patent were valid we could be liable to o2 for damages based on past sales and could further be permanently enjoined from selling those products directly or through distribution arrangements for use in taiwan although many system and module manufacturers who use our products have shifted and are continuing to shift their manufacturing from taiwan to china a significant portion of our expected future revenue over the next several years is expected to come from users of our ccfl backlight inverter product family in taiwan a final judgment awarded by a court prohibiting direct or indirect sales of our mp 1011a or mp 1015 products into taiwan would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for at least several quarters while we work to transition customers to alternative noninfringing products we cannot be sure that we could successfully effect such a transition if we are permanently enjoined from selling other newer products into taiwan this would have an immediate drastic and adverse effect on our ability to continue in our business as presently conducted 

o2’s lawsuits against our customers and other third parties 

in addition to lawsuits between o2 and us o2 has also initiated numerous legal proceedings in taiwan and in the united states against other companies which have been purchasers supplier andor users of our products we are aware that in some cases those companies have been enjoined from using mp1011a and mp1015 products imported into taiwan in at least two cases preliminary injunctions were upheld by district courts in taiwan injunctions against endusers of our products necessarily reduce the demand for our products potentially leading to reduced sales under certain circumstances we have agreed to indemnify certain customers and manufacturer against patent infringement continued expenditure of our funds in defending customers and manufacturer against o2’s lawsuits could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

  

additional o2 patents 

we are aware that o2 has recently been issued at least one other us patent that is a continuation of the patents it has accused us of infringing has also filed for a us patent that would be a continuation of the patents it has accused us of infringing and has filed for related patents in other asian countries we are not aware that any foreign patents have been issued in response to these patent applications and do not know when if ever any such patent will issue nevertheless we expect o2 may pursue claims against us based on this additional issued us patent or any other additional us or foreign patents that o2 may obtain in the future in this regard o2 often has sued us on additional patents as they have issued including suits on two additional patents filed in october 2004 depending on the scope and severity of those claims any injunctions that may be issued against us or damages that may be awarded against us could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

linear technology corporation 

on may 3 2004 linear filed a complaint for misappropriation of trade secrets unfair business practices california common law unfair competition breach of agreement and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing against us and timothy cox a former linear employee who currently works for us in the superior court of the state of california santa clara county effective january 25 2005 we entered into an agreement to settle the action on terms mutually satisfactory to the parties and the case was dismissed 

on july 16 2004 linear filed a complaint with the us international trade commission itc under section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 the investigation is now captioned in the matter of certain voltage regulator circuits components thereof and products containing same inv no 337ta521 linear filed a letter supplementing the complaint on august 10 2004 in its complaint linear alleges that two of our products the mp1556 a product within our dc to dc converter product family and the ev0063 the evaluation board containing the mp1556 infringe its us patent nos 5481178 and 6580258 linear subsequently supplemented its infringement allegations to include additional products and products under development linear has examined numerous other products within our dc to dc converter product family that do not employ the particular circuitry utilized in the mp1556 and has not accused those other products of infringement therefore linear’s allegations appear limited to the particular circuitry used in a relatively small number of products and products under development linear alleges that we violated section 337 because we imported these allegedly infringing products into the united states sold them for importation in the united states andor sold them within the united states after importing them the complaint requests that the itc institute an investigation and after the investigation issue an exclusion order and a cease and desist order prohibiting specific unfair acts found to be illegal in the investigation on august 11 2004 the itc ordered that an investigation be instituted to determine whether there has been a violation of section 337 as alleged in the complaint we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims and are defending vigorously against them the matter had been scheduled for trial before the itc commencing march 30 2005 however at linear’s request due to a conflict with another trial the judge has rescheduled the trial to commence june 22 2005 if linear is successful in securing an exclusion order against the mp1556 ev0063 and potentially other products such an exclusion order would prevent such products from being shipped into the united states and would have a material adverse effect on our business 

microsemi corporation 

on october 7 2004 microsemi filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the central district of california the lawsuit identifies four patents—us patent nos 5615093 5923129 5930121 and 6198234—that purportedly are now owned by microsemi and alleges that we infringe those patents the complaint describes the patents as covering ‘display lamp driver’ technologies which facilitate the lighting of electronic displays found in laptop and personal computers personal digital assistants and televisions as well as countless lcd screens 

the complaint does not identify which claims in the four patents are allegedly infringed nor does it identify which of our products supposedly infringe the patent claims the complaint requests an injunction to prevent us from allegedly infringing the patents as well as unspecified damages attorneys’ fees costs and expenses we have filed an answer and counterclaim denying infringement and seeking a declaration that we do not infringe the patents andor that the patents are invalid the court has scheduled a case management conference hearing for april 18 2005 

  

based upon the description of the technology contained in microsemi’s complaint and microsemi’s responses to discovery requests we understand that microsemi will contend that one or more of our ccfl backlight inverter products infringes its patents because the litigation is in a preliminary stage it is difficult to predict how it will proceed or what the ultimate outcome will be if we do not prevail in the litigation we could be ordered to pay monetary damages and we could be enjoined from selling one or more of our ccfl backlight inverter products into the us either directly or indirectly in 2004 revenues from our ccfl backlight inverter product family were 219 million respectively or 460 of total revenue because many of our products are sold indirectly by our customers back into the us a us injunction covering one or more of our products would likely substantially reduce sales of those products any of the results described above would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

micrel corporation 

on november 10 2004 micrel filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of california the lawsuit identifies two patents—us patent nos 5517046 entitled “high voltage lateral dmos device with enhanced drift region” and 5556796 entitled “selfalignment technique for forming junction isolation and wells”—that purportedly are owned by micrel and alleges that our products infringe those patents michael hsing our chief executive officer and another of our employees are named inventors on both of micrel’s patents and jim moyer our chief design engineer is a named inventor on one of them micrel’s complaint does not identify which claims in the two patents are allegedly infringed nor does it identify which of our products allegedly infringe the patent claims however because micrel’s patents relate to semiconductor manufacturing processes and semiconductor design elements rather than a specific device all of our products could potentially be implicated the complaint requests among other remedies preliminary and permanent injunctions to prevent us from allegedly infringing the patents as well as unspecified damages attorneys’ fees costs and expenses 

on november 29 2004 micrel filed an amended complaint adding causes of action for alleged statutory and common law misappropriation of trade secrets alleged breach of confidentiality agreements by messrs hsing and moyer both former employees of micrel and alleged violation of california’s unfair competition law the amended complaint also adds messrs hsing and moyer as defendants micrel’s amended complaint adds requests for damages attributable to the alleged misappropriation of micrel’s trade secrets and alleged violation of the confidentiality agreements for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent our future use of micrel’s alleged trade secrets and for attorneys’ fees and costs we have filed a motion to dismiss these claims on statute of limitations and preemption grounds 

the court has not set a trial date and discovery has not yet begun because the litigation is in a very preliminary stage it is difficult to predict how it will proceed or what the ultimate outcome will be we have however conducted an initial review of the micrel patents and compared them with the manufacturing processes and design elements we use for our products we have also conducted an initial review of the causes of action added by the amended complaint based on this initial review we believe that we have meritorious defenses to all of micrel’s claims if we do not prevail in the litigation we could be ordered to pay to micrel substantial monetary damages including restitution disgorgement of profits and punitive damages and we could be enjoined from selling one or more of our products into the us either directly or indirectly because many of our products are sold indirectly by our customers back into the us a us injunction covering one or more of our products would likely substantially reduce sales of those products any of these results would have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and any injunction that prohibits us from selling significant products for any length of time would have an immediate and drastic negative effect on our business and results of operations

market price of our common stock 

our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol “mpwr” as of march 1 2005 we had approximately 168 stockholders of record we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future we currently intend to retain our earnings if any for use in our business 

 

 recent sales of unregistered securities 

since january 1 2004 we have sold and issued the following unregistered securities 

 

  

 the sales and issuances of securities described in paragraphs 1 and 2 above were exempt from registration under the securities act by virtue of section 42 of the securities act or by virtue of rule 701 promulgated under the securities act in that they were offered and sold either pursuant to a written compensatory benefit plan or pursuant to a written contract relating to compensation as provided by rule 701 

use of proceeds 

on november 18 2004 our registration statement on form s1 registration no 333117327 was declared effective for our initial public offering our initial public offering of common stock occurred on november 18 2004 this offering terminated upon the expiration of the unexercised portion of the underwriters’ overallotment option therefore 39175 of the registered shares covered by the underwriters’ overallotment option were not sold the underwriting syndicate was managed by goldman sachs  co merrill lynch  co deutsche bank securities and piper jaffray 

under this registration statement we registered 6325000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of 850 per share including 825000 shares subject to the underwriters’ overallotment option which option was exercised in part with an aggregate public offering price of approximately 538 million we registered 4825000 of these shares on the company’s behalf and 1500000 of these shares on behalf of certain of our selling stockholders 

the sale of 4785825 shares of common stock by the company including 785825 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of the overallotment option resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to the company of approximately 407 million approximately 28 million of which the company applied to underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately 29 million of which the company applied to related costs as a result the company received net proceeds of approximately 349 million from the offering 

as of march 1 2005 we had invested the 349 million in net proceeds from the offering in government securities and corporate preferred equities we intend to use these proceeds for general corporate purposes including working capital research and development general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures including the facility in china described in “business—manufacturing” which facility involves a 

  

commitment of at least 5 million we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to fund possible investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses products or technologies or in establishing joint ventures although none is currently contemplated

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report on form 10ka this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see “forwardlooking statements” above our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report on form 10ka particularly under the heading “trends risks and uncertainties” 

the accompanying management’s discussion and analysis reflects the effects of the restatement discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable inventories income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources because these estimates can vary depending on the situation actual results may differ from the estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab 101a and 101b “sab 101” and staff accounting bulletin no104 revenue recognition collectively referred to as “sab 104” issued by the staff of the sec  sab 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in our recognizing revenue upon shipment when title passes to most customers but in the case of one third party who accounted for 30 of our revenue in 2003 we have recognized revenue upon its sale of our products to its customers sell through basis we discontinued using this third party in march 2004 should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 

  

the majority of our sales are made through distribution arrangements with third parties although some of these arrangements include stock rotation rights that permit the return of up to 5 of the previous six months’ purchases no more than once every six months we have not experienced any significant returns pursuant to these provisions our normal payment terms with our distributors are 30 days from invoice date and our arrangements with our largest distributors do not include price protection provisions although some of our arrangements with smaller distributors include price protection provisions permitting them a credit for unsold inventory if we reduce our list prices we have not experienced any significant claims pursuant to these provisions in addition terms of our significant distribution agreements include the nonexclusive right to sell and the agreement to use best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in certain regions of the world and the ability to terminate the agreement by either party with three months notice we provide a standard 90day warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods provide replacements at no charge to the customer or refund amounts to the customer for defective products estimated sales returns and warranty costs based on historical experience by product are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized we formerly had one distribution arrangement with a third party with extended payment terms these terms were the lesser of 60 days or upon receipt of end customer payment by the third party revenue for this arrangement was recognized on a sellthrough basis when the goods were shipped by the third party to the end customer under such distribution arrangement the third party did not stock inventory of our products 

inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the actual costs of our inventory or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

accounting for income taxes  statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “sfas no 109” accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the united states or us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

as of december 31 2003 we had a valuation allowance of approximately 48 million attributable principally to certain unrealizable net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as of december 31 2004 we had a valuation allowance of approximately 18 million attributable to the estimated unrealizable deferred tax assets generated from tax benefits resulting from certain stockbased compensation transactions should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination would be made 

contingencies  from time to time we receive notices or become aware that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the intellectual property rights of others when this occurs we will investigate and determine whether a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 sfas 5 “accounting for contingencies” should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the management’s judgment and given the facts and circumstances in each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated should a loss be probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas 5 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from the technical experts in each specific matter the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations which may be ongoing 

  

prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted for example if a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable outcome to operations 

accounting for stockbased compensation our stockbased employee compensation plans are described more fully in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we account for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations we amortize deferred stockbased compensation over the vesting periods of the related options which are generally four years in accordance with fasb interpretation no 28 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 15 and 25  

we have recorded deferred stockbased compensation representing the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock at the grant date and the option exercise price we determined the fair market value of our common stock based upon several factors including trends in the broad market for technology stocks and the expected valuation we would obtain in an initial public offering had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the fair market value of our common stock materially different amounts of stockbased compensation could have been reported 

pro forma information regarding net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is required in order to show our net loss as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation transition and disclosure  this information is contained in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the fair value of options issued pursuant to our option plan at the grant date were estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model 

recent accounting pronouncements 

the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 46 fin 46 consolidation of variable interest entities  in january 2003 and a revised interpretation of fin 46 fin 46r in december 2003 fin 46 requires certain variable interest entities vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties the provisions of fin 46 are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january 31 2003 since january 31 2003 we have not invested in any entities we believe are variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary for all arrangements entered into after january 31 2003 we are required to continue to apply fin 46 through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004 we are required to adopt the provisions of fin 46r for those arrangements in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 for arrangements entered into prior to february 1 2003 we were required to adopt the provisions of fin 46r in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 the adoption of fin 46r did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 150 “sfas 150” accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 sfas 150 is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption the adoption of sfas 150 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2003 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 104 “sab 104” revenue recognition  sab 104 updates portions of existing interpretative guidance in order to make this guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations the adoption of sab 104 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

on december 16 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas 123r” sfas 123r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb opinion 25 to stock compensation awards issued to employees rather the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 

we have not yet quantified the effects of the adoption of sfas 123r but it is expected that the new standard may result in significant stockbased compensation expense the actual effects of adopting sfas 123r will be dependent on numerous factors including but not limited to the valuation model chosen by us to value stockbased awards the assumed award forfeiture rate the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period and the transition method as described below chosen for adopting sfas 123r 

sfas 123r will be effective for our fiscal quarter beginning july 1 2005 sfas 123r is applied to new awards and to awards modified repurchased or cancelled after the effective date additionally compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grantdate fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas123 

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 151 inventory costs sfas 151 an amendment of arb no 43 adoption is required for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 sfas 151 requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material be recognized as currentperiod expenses in addition sfas 151 requires that the allocation of production overhead be based on normal capacity we do not expect the adoption of sfas 151 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

  

results of operations 

the table below states the income statement items as a percentage of revenues 

 

 revenues revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 were 476 million an increase of 234 million or 966 over 242 million for the previous fiscal year this was due to higher unit shipments for several new products introduced in 2002 and 2003 resulting in volume shipments that took place in 2004 our products gaining market share and growth of the computer and consumer electronic markets revenues from our dc to dc converter product family increased 139 million or 2508 due to higher volume shipments resulting from increased order rates for existing and new products for shipments into the computer and consumer electronic communications markets revenues from our ccfl backlight inverter product family increased 50 million or 297 due to higher volume shipments resulting from increased order rates for existing and new products revenues from our led driver product family increased 35 million or 2402 due to higher volume shipments resulting from increased order rates for existing and new products revenues for our audio amplifier product family increased 10 million or 3165 due to an increased demand for our existing products 

revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 were 242 million compared to 122 million for the year ended december 31 2002 an increase of 983 this increase was due to an increase in revenues from our ccfl backlight inverter and dc to dc converter product families the increase in revenues from our ccfl backlight inverter product family was due to several new product releases and increased demand for our existing products this resulted in higher unit volumes which were partially offset by a decline in average selling prices the increase in revenues from our dc to dc converter product family was due to an increased number of new product offerings for the computer consumer electronics and communications markets volume sales began in the third quarter of 2003 for our dc to dc product family revenues from our audio amplifier product family accounted for 13 and 140 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 respectively revenues for our audio amplifier product family for the year ended december 31 2002 were primarily driven by a nonrecurring order by one customer 

geographically international revenues were 460 million or 967 of net revenues for year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 295 million as compared to international revenues of 165 million or 683 of net revenues for the same period in fiscal 2003 international revenues consist of shipments to countries outside the united states 

although 33 and 317 of direct sales are to customers in the united states in 2004 and 2003 the majority of these shipments were made to a third party in the us with whom we had a distribution arrangement who in turn shipped to customers in asia our distribution arrangement with this third party was terminated in march 2004 as a result our overall revenues from both direct sales and sales through third parties into asia were 989 and 986 in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

the following table illustrates changes in our revenues by product family amounts in thousands 

 

  

 gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenues or gross margin was 588 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 547 for year ended december 31 2003 the increase in gross margin was primarily due volume efficiencies attributable to a growth in unit shipments from our dc to dc converter product family and volume efficiencies attributable to a growth in unit shipments from our ccfl backlight inverter product family the gross margin was adversely impacted by 913000 or 19 for stock compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 217000 or 09 for the year ended december 31 2003 

gross margin was 547 for the year ended december 31 2003 compared with 441 for the year ended december 31 2002 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower per unit costs associated with volume efficiencies attributable to a growth in unit shipments from our ccfl backlight inverter product family and the introduction of several new products in our dc to dc converter product in addition we reduced our manufacturing costs by converting to a lower cost foundry in the first half of 2003 reducing our assembly costs and improving our test yields the gross margin was adversely impacted by 217000 or 09 for stock compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2003

 research and development expenses were 77 million or 162 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 and 55 million or 227 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase of 22 million was due to an increase in personnel and expenses associated with new product development activities 

research and development expenses increased to 55 million or 227 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 from 45 million or 365 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 this dollar increase of 232 was primarily due to higher compensation and related costs of 08 million driven by increases in our engineering headcount 

  

selling general and administrative 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses were 71 million or 148 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 and 39 million or 162 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase of 32 million was due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel in the united states taiwan and china to support our increase in customers and growth in revenues in addition general and administrative expenses increased due to an increase in professional fees such as legal audit tax and director and officer liability insurance sales general and administrative expenses could increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future as a result of ongoing efforts to comply with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

selling general and administrative expenses were 39 million or 162 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 and 24 million or 200 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 the increase of 15 million was due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel in the united states taiwan and china which started in the second quarter of 2003 to support our increase in customers and growth in revenues in addition general and administrative expenses increased in administrative personnel higher insurance costs and professional service costs such as legal audit and tax 

patent litigation 

 

 patent litigation expenses were 78 million or 165 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 and 43 million or 179 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2003 the dollar increase was due to the increase in activities associated with multiple lawsuits in the us and taiwan in addition to the o2 lawsuit that existed in 2003 three more patent infringement suits were brought against us in 2004 by linear microsemi and micrel for a more complete description of our litigation matters please read “legal proceedings” beginning on page 25 

patent litigation expenses increased to 43 million or 179 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 from 16 million or 131 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 this dollar increase of 1703 was due to increased activities associated with multiple lawsuits in the us and taiwan with o2 

stockbased compensation 

 

 stockbased compensation expense was 106 million or 224 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 and 29 million or 122 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 the 

  

increase is due to the granting of options during the second half of 2003 and first half of 2004 with exercise prices below the deemed fair value of our common stock resulting in deferred stock compensation which resulted in an increase in amortization during 2004 

in october 2004 our stockholders approved an issuance of restricted stock of 176740 shares which resulted in additional amortization of stockbased compensation expense of 229800 in 2004 

future amortization of stockbased compensation for outstanding stock options and restricted stock at december 31 2004 will be 30 million for the six months ended june 30 2005 after which time the company will be required to adopt sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment and report stock compensation based on the fair values of the instruments 

stockbased compensation allocated to sales general and administrative expenses increased to 55 million in 2004 from 18 million in 2003 this increase is primarily due to current year option grants to sales administrative personnel board members and consultants similarly stock based compensation allocated to research and development expenses increased to 52 million in 2004 from 11 million in 2003 due to current year option grants to research and development employees in addition stockbased compensation of 02 million has been recorded as an offset to revenue in both 2004 and 2003 for stock options granted to a nonemployee in connection with a distribution arrangement 

we have also granted stock options to individuals employed by certain of our customers these options are valued using the fair value method and the related charge of 493312 for the year ended december 31 2004 is classified as a reduction of revenue in the statement of operations based on the fair value of our common stock at december 31 2004 additional charges of approximately 45944 will be recorded in 2005 over the remaining vesting periods the ultimate amount of this charge in 2005 will vary depending on changes in the fair market value of our common stock 

interest and other income net interest and other income net was 02 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 02 million for the year ended december 31 2003 interest income is earned on our cash and shortertem investments 

interest and other income was 02 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 02 million for the year ended december 31 2002 interest income is earned on our cash and shortterm investments 

interest and other expense net interest and other expense net was 01 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and for the year ended december 31 2003 we did not have interest or other expense 

for the year ended december 31 2003 we did not have interest or other expense for the year ended december 31 2002 we had 01 million in interest and other expense as a result of our notes payable and our credit line the notes along with all related interest were converted to preferred stock in 2002 and the credit line was repaid in 2002 

income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2004 our effective tax rate was 279 compared to the federal statutory rate of 35 the difference is principally due to state and foreign income taxes and stockbased compensation expenses partially offset by the change in the deferred tax allowance for the year ended december 31 2003 our effective tax rate was zero as a result of our net operating loss 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2004 we had working capital of 526 million including cash and cash equivalents of 320 million and shortterm investments of 170 million compared to working capital of 167 million including cash and cash equivalents of 116 million and shortterm investments of 15 million as of december 31 2003 we have financed our growth primarily with proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock and from operating activities in november 2004 we received total proceeds of 349 million net of related issuance fees and estimated offering costs from our initial public offering we believe that our current cash cash equivalents and investments as well as cash flows from operations will be sufficient to continue our operations and meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 

net cash provided by operating activities was 90 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 22 million of cash used for the year ended december 31 2003 the cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2004 was due to a decrease in accounts receivable of 06 million increases in accrued liabilities of 24 million accrued compensation of 10 million and accounts payable of 16 

  

million this was offset by an increase in inventory of 38 million and an increase in prepaid and other expenses of 09 million in addition we had 121 million of stock compensation expense 11 million of depreciation which are each noncash transactions and our loss of  37 million the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of one of our largest customers delaying payment in the second half of 2003 because it was in the process of being acquired by another company following the acquisition the customer paid 37 million in the first half of 2004 so its account is now current the increase in inventory is the result of product built to meet increased customer demand the increase in prepaid and other expense was primarily due to our directors and officers insurance premium and audit expenses related to us being a public company the use of cash in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was primarily due to our net loss of 33 million we also increased our accounts receivable by 33 million which was offset by 34 million in stock compensation expense a noncash transaction the use of cash in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was primarily due to our net loss of 32 million we increased our accounts receivable by 02 million inventory by 07 million and prepaid and other by 02 million which was offset by 08 million increase in accounts payable and 06 million in depreciation a noncash transaction 

net cash used in investing activities was 245 million in the year ended december 31 2004 and 39 million in the year ended december 31 2003 in the year ended december 31 2004 we made purchases of 32 million for capital equipment and 170 million for investments and made payments of 55 million cash deposit and 03 million in asset deposits to a court in taiwan related to our patent litigation with o2 all of which was partially offset by the sale of 15 million of investments in the year ended december 31 2003 we purchased 16 million of capital equipment and we purchased 40 million of investments offset by the sale of 25 million in investments in addition we paid 08 million as a deposit to a court in taiwan relating to the o2 patent litigation net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was 11 million the result of purchasing 11 million in capital equipment 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2004 was 357 million compared to 05 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2004 was the result of our initial public offering which increased our cash by 349 million net of offering expenses in addition we received 05 million from the exercise of stock options by our employees and 03 million from exercise of series c preferred stock warrants net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended 2003 was due from the exercise of stock options by our employees cash provided by financing activities for the year ended 2002 was primarily from the issuance of convertible preferred stock of 166 million partially offset by repayment of notes payable for 07 million and a bank line of credit of 06 million 

in addition we have the following litigationrelated contingencies that might also affect our liquidity and capital resources cash bonds of approximately 61 million posted with taiwanese courts potential penalties relating to our injunctions andor possible future legal fees and indemnification obligations to be incurred in connection with our o2 linear microsemi and micrel litigation matters please refer to “business—legal proceedings” on page 23 for a more complete discussion of these contingencies

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

monolithic power systems inc together with its consolidated subsidiaries “mps” or the “company” is a high performance analog and mixedsignal semiconductor company we design develop and market proprietary advanced analog and mixedsignal semiconductors for large and high growth markets our semiconductors or integrated circuits ics are used in a variety of electronic products such as notebook computers flat panel displays cellular handsets digital cameras wireless local area network lan access points home entertainment systems and personal digital assistants the company competes on its ability to offer deep systemlevel and applications knowledge strong analog and mixedsignal design expertise and low cost and high performance products through our proprietary process technology for the design and manufacture of our ics 

  

industry overview 

  

semiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment within the semiconductor industry components can be classified as either discrete devices such as individual transistors or ics in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form 

  

a more complicated electronic circuit ics can be further divided into three primary categories digital analog and mixedsignal digital ics such as memory devices and microprocessors can store or perform arithmetic functions on data that is represented by a series of ones and zeroes analog ics in contrast handle real world signals such as temperature pressure light sound or speed in addition analog ics also perform power management functions such as regulating or converting voltages for electronic devices mixedsignal ics combine digital and analog functions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to digital systems 

  

analog and mixedsignal markets we focus on the market for ‘high performance’ analog and mixedsignal ics ‘high performance’ includes integration of higher levels of functionality into a single chip greater precision higher speed and lower heat and noise there are several key factors that distinguish the analog and mixedsignal ic market from digital ic markets these factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

products and applications 

  

we currently have four standard product families that address multiple applications within the computing consumer and communications markets our products are differentiated with respect to their high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy and efficiency making them costeffective relative to many competing solutions these product families include 

  

liquid crystal display lcd backlight inverter ics lcd backlight inverter ics are used in systems that provide the light source for lcd panels typically found in notebooks lcd monitors car navigational systems and more recently lcd televisions these ics function by converting low voltage direct current dc or battery voltage to high voltage alternating current ac we believe our lcd backlight inverter ics were the first to utilize a full bridge resonant topology that allows for high efficiency extended lifetimes for cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfls and lower signal interference with adjacent components the full bridge topology is now industry standard for these products we also believe that our lcd backlight inverter ics are the semiconductor industry’s only backlight inverter ics with four fullyintegrated power devices this integration reduces the overall size total solution part count and cost for our customers our lcd product family encompasses all of the products that we formerly referred to as our ccfl product family as well as other nonccfl solutions for lcd backlight inverters 

  

direct current dc to dc converter ics dc to dc converter ics are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range of electronic systems such as portable electronic devices wireless lan access points home appliances automobiles and medical equipment we believe that our dc to dc converters are differentiated particularly with respect to their high degree of integration and rapid switching speeds these features are important to our customers as they result in fewer components smaller form factors more accurate regulation of voltages and ultimately lower system costs through the elimination of discrete power devices 

  

light emitting diode led driver ics led driver ics are used in lighting displays and can be used in small portable devices such as color cellular handsets personal digital assistants global positioning systems and electronic gaming systems as well as in emerging applications such as traffic lights and automobile signal lights we were one of the first companies to offer led driver ics with a protection feature that limits damage to a system in the event of a poor connection we believe that our led driver ics are differentiated in the market with respect to their small size power efficiency and costeffectiveness 

  

audio amplifier ics audio amplifier ics are used to amplify sound produced by audio processors we currently offer class d audio amplifiers which are wellsuited for applications that are particularly sensitive to both size and power efficiency such as plasma televisions lcd televisions and dvd players with today’s systems becoming smaller and utilizing larger amounts of power solution sizes and the management of heat dissipation are becoming increasingly important to overall system design the high degree of power efficiency and small form factor provided by our class d 

  

audio amplifiers allows system vendors to significantly reduce heat dissipation eliminating the costly and sizable fans and heat sinks traditionally required by audio amplifier ics these features enable our customers to achieve their objectives without sacrificing sound quality 

  

we currently target the computing consumer electronics and wireless markets of these three markets the computing market represents the largest portion of our revenues as we continue to expand our product portfolio and addressable markets and as other end markets in which we participate continue to grow we expect that our revenues from the computing market may decline as a percentage of our total revenues over time the following chart is a brief summary of our portfolio solution for various applications for each of these applications we either are currently shipping product or have design wins which are decisions by oems or odms to use our ics 

  

   

customers sales and marketing 

  

we market our products through distribution arrangements and through our direct sales organization to oems odms and electronic manufacturing service providers odms typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of oems and electronic manufacturing service providers typically provide manufacturing services for oems and other electronic product suppliers in 2004 our largest direct customers were asian information technology ait and uppertech accounting for 28 and 21 of our net revenues respectively our current distribution agreements with ait and uppertech provide that each distributor shall each have the nonexclusive right to sell and each agrees to use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in china taiwan and hong kong that each agreement may be terminated by either us or the distributor on three months’ notice and that payment shall occur within 30 days from the end of the month in which we deliver the product neither agreement includes price protection provisions original design manufacturers electronic manufacturing service providers and other third parties under distribution arrangements are not end customers but rather serve as a channel to many end users of our products while other end users of our products purchase from us directly 

  

we have sales offices located in the united states taiwan china and korea because our products typically require a highly technical sales effort we are planning to expand our base of sales and applications support personnel worldwide for example in 2005 we expect to expand or complete the opening of additional sales offices in the united states japan and europe information about our revenues and longlived assets in different geographic regions of the world is provided in note 15 to the financial statements 

  

because our sales are billed and payable in united states dollars our sales are not directly subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates however because 989 of our revenues in 2004 were attributable to direct or indirect sales to customers who manufacture their products in asia changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products 

  

we generally warrant our products for 90 days from shipment and for longer periods in certain cases historical warranty expense as a percentage of revenues has been negligible 

  

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers that have not yet shipped our backlog at december 31 2004 was 86 million as order lead times may vary and as industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future sales and our quarterly revenues also depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter because our manufacturing lead times are generally 6 to 14 weeks we often must build in advance of customer orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that expected sales will not materialize leading to excess inventory if we have excess inventory we would expect to either sell it at a substantial discount or dispose of it altogether either of which would negatively affect our profit margins 

  

research and development 

  

we have assembled a qualified team of engineers with core competencies in analog and mixedsignal design expertise through our research and development efforts we have developed a collection of intellectual property and knowhow that we are able to leverage across our products and markets examples of our intellectual property and knowhow include the development of high efficiency power devices the design of precision analog circuits and expertise in mixedsignal integration 

  

our research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas system architectures circuit design and implementation and process technology in the area of system architectures we are exploring new ways of solving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new markets and applications that align well with our core capabilities in the area of circuit design and implementation our initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products developing more standard cells and libraries improving our device structures and adding new features to our products for example we are currently working to expand our product portfolio into new products areas such as operational amplifiers 

  

we have developed a proprietary process technology that is applicable across a wide range of analog and mixedsignal products we intend to continue to invest in our process technology to further refine this technology with respect to overall chip size and power handling capabilities as appropriate in the future we may also expand our base of process technologies but only if these technologies are costeffective and enable us to further expand our product offerings beyond what is currently achievable 

  

research and development expenses were approximately 77 million 55 million and 45 million in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively which excludes stockbased compensation of 51 million 10 million and 6900 respectively 

  

patents and intellectual property matters 

  

we rely on our proprietary technologies which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and our proprietary manufacturing process technologies for manufacturing our products our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies 

  

in general we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit designs that we believe are patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies as trade secrets as of march 1 2005 we have 13 issued united states and foreign patents and 61 united states and foreign applications on file our patents are material to our business but we do not rely on any one particular patent for our success our issued us patents are 

  

due to expire between 2018 and 2023 we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes we have entered into a patent license agreement with another integrated circuit company pursuant to which we have granted this company a license with certain limited sublicense rights under certain of our patents to make use and sell certain of this company’s own integrated circuit products for a period of two years and for which this company is obligated to pay us royalties based on sales of those products we also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate we have not to date registered any of our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business despite precautions that we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation with o2 linear microsemi and micrel for a more complete description of our legal matters please read “legal proceedings” beginning on page 25 patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims any such litigation could be very costly and may divert our management’s resources further we have agreed to indemnify our customers and supplier in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling selected products or could be required to indemnify our customers or supplier or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if any of our products is found to infringe and we are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

manufacturing 

  

we utilize a fabless business model working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits this fabless approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs and capital expenditures in contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies which utilize standard process technologies and design rules established by their foundry partners we have developed our own proprietary process technology and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technology on their equipment in their facilities for use solely on our behalf this close collaboration and control over the manufacturing process has historically resulted in favorable yields for our integrated circuits 

  

we currently contract with advanced semiconductor manufacturing corporation of shanghai “asmc” to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in china once our silicon wafers have been produced they are shipped either to third party subcontractors or to our facilities in los gatos california for wafer sort our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent subcontractors in malaysia china and thailand the assembled ics are then forwarded for final testing primarily at our los gatos facilities prior to shipping to our customers 

  

we have signed an agreement with a chinese local authority to establish a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics pursuant to the agreement we have agreed to contribute capital in the form of cash inkind assets andor intellectual property of at least 5 million to a wholly owned chinese subsidiary as the registered capital of the subsidiary pursuant to the agreement the local authorities have agreed to pay for design and build our plant and related infrastructure based on our specifications we have agreed to buy the plant five years after completion for the actual cost of construction which is anticipated to be under 1 million we expect the facility to become operational in the fourth quarter of 2005 at which point we hope to realize several improvements in our business model in the near term we expect to experience an immediate reduction in testing and shipping costs due to lower labor and facility costs and significantly shorter transportation distances in the intermediate to long term we hope to expand our product testing capabilities in our china facility and be positioned to be able to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support operations 

  

key personnel and employees 

  

the company’s performance is substantially dependent on the performance of its executive officers and key employees due to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixedsignal ics our engineers generally have more years of experience and greater aptitude for analog and mixedsignal design engineers with such skills are limited in number and difficult to replace the loss of the services of key officers managers engineers and other technical personnel would harm the business the success of the company depends on its ability to identify hire train develop and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel as of december 31 2004 we had 154 employees located in the united states taiwan china and korea of these employees approximately 40 were involved in research and development 

  

competition 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit both applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products our industry is characterized by decreasing unit selling prices over the life of a product we compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products micrel incorporated microsemi corporation national semiconductor corporation o2 micro international semtech corporation stmicroelectronic and texas instruments 

  

we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market we believe that we are competitive with respect to these factors particularly because our ics typically are smaller in size are highly integrated possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than competitive products however we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market 

  

trends risks and uncertainties 

  

our business is inherently risky you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and growth prospects would likely be adversely affected in such an event the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 

  

we have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 

  

we have incurred losses on an annual basis since our inception as of december 31 2004 we had an accumulated deficit of 207 million we expect to incur significant operating expenses over the next several years in connection with the continued development and expansion of our business our operating expenses include general and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses litigation expenses stock based compensation expenses and research and development expenses relating to products that will not be introduced and will not generate revenues until later periods if at all we may not achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 

  

if we are unsuccessful in our current lawsuits with o2 micro international limited in either the us or in taiwan we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages or fines any unfavorable outcome would cause our revenues in the lcd backlight product family to decline significantly and severely harm our business and operating results 

  

this risk factor only summarizes the various legal proceedings and related events we strongly advise you to read “ legal proceedings ” beginning on page 25 for a more detailed description 

  

we are engaged in multiple legal proceedings with o2 micro inc and its parent corporation o2 micro international limited we refer to o2 micro and o2 micro international together as o2 these proceedings involve various claims and counterclaims in the united states and taiwan by o2 and us alleging among other things patent infringements and misappropriation of trade secrets all of which relate to our ccfl backlight inverter ics which are part of our lcd backlight inverter product family o2 has obtained an injunction in taiwan prohibiting us from manufacturing designing displaying importing or selling two of our most significant products in taiwan either directly or through a third party acting at our request the patent dispute in both the united states and the taiwanese litigation involves issues that could affect all of our ccfl backlight inverter products used in the united states and taiwan o2 has also taken legal action against our wafer manufacturer and some of our customers and users of our products in the united states and taiwan if we are not successful in our litigation with o2 we could be ordered to pay monetary fines andor damages to o2 andor our customers if we are found to be in violation of the taiwan injunction or liable to o2 on its claims against us we could also be prevented from selling many of our products either into taiwan directly or through the distribution arrangements we currently employ or in the us because we have agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and manufacturer against patent infringement claims and we are currently defending our manufacturer and one of our customers against claim by o2 we could be liable to our manufacturer or customers who have purchased our products and whom we have indemnified against liability for damages arising from claims by o2 or others that our products infringe patents of o2 or others our customers and endusers of our products could decide not to use our products or our wafer manufacturer could decide to reduce or eliminate its manufacturing of the related lcd backlight inverter product family in an attempt to avoid litigation with o2 or our products or their accounts payable to us could be seized from them 

  

a significant portion of our expected future revenues over the next several years is expected to come from users of our lcd backlight product family in taiwan any of the outcomes described above would have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations for one or more quarters and any injunction that prohibits us from selling significant products for any length of time would have an immediate and drastic negative effect on our business and results of operations depending on the scope and severity of those claims any injunctions that may be issued against us or fines andor damages that we may to pay could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

if we are unsuccessful in our current patent infringement lawsuits with linear technology corporation microsemi corporation or micrel incorporated we could be prevented from selling many of our products andor be required to pay substantial damages or fines any unfavorable outcome would cause our revenues to decline significantly and severely harm our business and operating results 

  

this risk factor only summarizes the various legal proceedings and related events we strongly advise you to read “legal proceedings” beginning on page 25 for a more detailed description 

  

in july 2004 linear technology corporation “linear” filed a complaint with the us international trade commission itc alleging that two of our products the mp1556 a product within our dc to dc converter product family and the ev0063 the evaluation board containing the mp1556 infringe its us patent nos 5481178 and 6580258 linear has subsequently supplemented its infringement allegations to include certain additional products and products under development linear’s complaint requests that the itc issue an exclusion order and a cease and desist order that would prevent products utilizing the circuitry in question from being imported into the us sales of our products identified by linear in its complaint accounted for less than 2 of our revenues for 2004 however if linear successfully adds other products to its complaint then the potential financial impact on the company could be much greater our dc to dc converter products are expected to account for a significant portion of our future revenues over the next several years 

  

in october 2004 microsemi corporation “microsemi” sued us in the united states district court for the central district of california alleging that our products infringe four of its patents microsemi’s complaint does not identify which claims in the four patents are allegedly infringed nor does it identify which of our products supposedly infringe the patent claims we have filed an answer and counterclaim denying infringement and seeking a declaration that we do not infringe the patents andor that the patents are invalid based upon the description of the technology contained in microsemi’s complaint and responses to our discovery requests we understand that microsemi will contend that one or more of our ccfl backlight inverter products infringes its patents the complaint requests an injunction to prevent us from allegedly infringing the patents as well as unspecified damages attorneys’ fees costs and expenses 

  

in november 2004 micrel incorporated “micrel” sued us in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging that our products infringe two of its patents michael hsing our chief executive officer and another of our employees are named inventors on both of micrel’s patents and jim moyer our chief design engineer is a named inventor on one of them micrel’s complaint does not identify which claims in the two patents are allegedly infringed nor does it identify which of our products supposedly infringe the patent claims however because micrel’s patents relate to semiconductor manufacturing processes and semiconductor design elements rather than a specific device all of our products could potentially be implicated micrel’s complaint requests an injunction to prevent us from allegedly infringing the patents as well as unspecified damages attorneys’ fees costs and expenses 

  

if we do not prevail in the linear litigation the microsemi litigation or the micrel litigation we could be enjoined from selling one or more of our products into the us either directly or indirectly 

  

because many of our products are sold indirectly by our customers back into the us a us injunction covering one or more of our products would likely substantially reduce sales of those products in addition if we do not prevail in the microsemi or micrel litigation we could be ordered to pay monetary damages to microsemi andor micrel we could also be liable to customers who have purchased our products and whom we have indemnified against liability for damages arising from claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others even if we are ultimately successful in the litigation with linear microsemi and micrel we could lose customers in the interim due to the surrounding uncertainty any of these results would have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations for one or more quarters and any injunction that prohibits us from selling significant products for any length of time would have an immediate and drastic negative effect on our business and results of operations 

  

given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our litigations our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our predictions with respect to any given quarter 

  

as described in “management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations— overview—patent litigation” until our litigations with o2 linear microsemi and micrel are resolved we will continue to incur substantial legal expenses that vary with the level of activity in the legal proceedings this level of activity is not entirely within our control as we may need to respond to legal actions by o2 linear microsemi or micrel consequently we may find it difficult to predict the legal expenses for any given quarter which will impair our ability to forecast our results of operations for that quarter it is likely that these expenses will increase leading up to and during our o2 trial scheduled for may 2005 the o2sumida trial scheduled for june 2005 and linear trial scheduled for june 2005 interim developments in these lawsuits may also contribute to increased volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of those developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in addition along with the claims asserted by o2 linear microsemi and micrel these or other third parties could assert that these or other of our products infringe their intellectual property rights which could result in restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of our products andor cause us to pay license fees and damages 

  

interim developments in our various legal proceedings may contribute to increased volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of those developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in the litigations 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights such as our litigation matters with o2 linear microsemi and micrel patent infringement is an ongoing risk in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may have to defend ourselves against infringement claims such litigation is very costly and may divert our management’s resources our management team could also be required to devote so much time effort and energy to the legal proceedings that the rest of our business suffers for example we spent 78 million or 165 of revenue in 2004 on patent litigation expenses and we expect patent litigation expenses to increase in absolute dollars in 2005 further we have agreed to indemnify our customers and supplier in some circumstances against liability from infringement by our products in the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our customers we could be enjoined from selling some or potentially all of our products or could be required to indemnify our customers or pay royalties or other damages to third parties if we were unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms we would either have to change our products so that they did not infringe or stop selling the infringing products which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we do not expect to sustain our recent growth rate 

  

due primarily to increased sales of our ccfl backlight inverter product family which are now part of our lcd backlight inverter product family and our dc to dc converter product family we have experienced significant revenue growth and have gained significant market share in relatively a short period of time specifically our annual revenues increased from 122 million in 2002 to 242 million in 2003 to 476 million in 2004 however we do not expect similar revenue growth or market share gains in the future periods accordingly you should not rely on results of any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance 

  

due to our limited operating history we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenues and appropriately budgeting for our expenses 

  

we were incorporated in 1997 and did not begin generating meaningful revenues until 2000 as a result we have only a short history from which to predict future revenues our limited operating experience combined with the rapidly evolving nature of the markets into which we sell our products as well as other factors which are beyond our control reduces our ability to accurately forecast quarterly or annual revenues we are currently expanding our staffing and increasing our expense levels in anticipation of future revenue growth if our revenues do not increase as anticipated significant losses could result due to our higher expense levels 

  

we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline 

  

our revenues expenses and results of operations are difficult to predict have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control for example our revenues for the first quarter of each year tend to be significantly less than the revenues for the last quarter of the previous year we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section many of which are beyond our control you should not rely on quartertoquarter or yearoveryear comparisons to predict our future financial performance unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 

  

the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and at various times has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand production capacity and rapid erosion of average selling prices although the semiconductor industry has recently experienced strong demand the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future which could result in pricing pressure on our products as well as lower demand for our products because a significant portion of our expenses is fixed in the short term or is incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales this could materially adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenues will decrease 

  

we believe that applications of our products in the computer consumer electronics and wireless markets will continue to account for a majority of our revenues in addition within these markets we are dependent upon a small number of products we are particularly dependent on the computing market including notebook and flat panel monitor applications and we expect that a significant level of our revenues and operating results will continue to be dependent upon notebook and flat panel monitor applications for at least the near term if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve our revenues will decrease 

  

we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position 

  

we market our products through distribution arrangements and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include original equipment manufacturers original design manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers receivables from our customers are not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 

  

in addition in 2003 ctp yosun and ambitunique logistics third parties with whom we currently have or formerly had distribution arrangements accounted for 30 16 and 14 of our revenues respectively we terminated our distribution arrangement with ctp in march 2004 and entered into expanded distribution agreements with asian information technology or ait and uppertech in 2004 ait uppertech and yosun each of which is a distributor accounted for 28 21 and 9 of our revenues respectively any future termination or loss of a distribution arrangement could reduce customers’ willingness or ability to purchase our products and could thereby reduce our revenues and adversely affect our future operating results 

  

we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to longterm supply contracts the loss of any significant customer any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers the cancellation of a significant customer order or the cancellation or delay of a customer’s or oem’s significant program or product could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our operations and financial condition for example revenues from our audio amplifier product family declined from 140 of total revenues in 2002 to 13 of total revenues in 2003 the decline was due to the loss of one major customer who placed a large nonrecurring order in the third and fourth quarters of 2002 

  

moreover we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a small number of end customer original equipment manufacturers or oems such as dell hewlettpackard ibm and sony although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve “design wins” which are decisions by oems andor original design manufacturers to use our products we do not have agreements with any of these end customers formal or informal therefore there can be no assurance that they will continue to choose to incorporate our ics into their products we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to oems or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics 

  

we have recently had to improve our internal accounting systems and controls and if we fail to make continued improvements our business may suffer 

  

our reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future as we have been an early stage private company we have had limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures as a result when our auditors audited our financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2003 they identified in their report to our audit committee three significant deficiencies in our internal accounting controls two of these significant deficiencies rose to the level of “material weaknesses” while the third was considered a “reportable condition” the two material weaknesses were that i we lacked certain formalized accounting policies and procedures including written procedures for the monthly quarterly and annual “closing” of our financial books and records and ii we lacked sufficient staff in our accounting and information technology departments the reportable condition was that our accounting personnel lacked adequate training on our enterprise resource planning system the report also contained other observations and recommendations none of which rose to the level of a “reportable condition” following our receipt of this report we consulted with our audit committee and undertook remedial steps to address these deficiencies including hiring additional staff training our new and existing staff and establishing monthly quarterly and annual closing procedures 

  

we believe that we have remediated the material weaknesses and reportable conditions in our internal controls as identified by our auditors in connection with our fiscal 2003 financial statements at the direction of our audit committee we engaged our external auditors to audit our financial statements for the quarter ended march 31 2004 in their report to the audit committee following this audit the material weaknesses and reportable condition previously identified were no longer reported however other matters that did not constitute material weaknesses or reportable conditions were identified these other matters included control deficiency recommendations relating to 

  

   

   

   

   

in response to these recommendations we will be transferring an internal employee to the position of financial planning and analysis this transfer will take effect once we hire a replacement to fill this employee’s current position of compliance and sec reporting we anticipate hiring this replacement in early april 2005 we have implemented the other recommendations relating to cost accounting and other reserve accrual and closing procedures in connection with our june 30 and september 30 2004 quarterly closes and our 2004 yearend audit we have also completed documentation of our information security policies these other control deficiencies did not have a 

  

material impact on our financial statements and as they all have now been addressed are not expected to have any future material impact on our financial statements if however we fail to continue to adequately staff our accounting and finance function and maintain internal controls adequate to meet the demands that will be placed upon us as a public company including the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our business may suffer 

  

standards for compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 are uncertain and if we fail to comply in a timely manner our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline 

  

we must comply with the rules promulgated under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 section 404 by december 31 2005 we expect to incur additional administrative expense as we implement section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act which requires management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our internal controls in addition the nasdaq national market on which our common stock is listed has also adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance these laws rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope complexity and cost of our corporate governance reporting and disclosure practices which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from business operations these new or changed laws regulations and standards are also subject to varying interpretations in many cases and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices we cannot be certain that we will comply with the requirements of section 404 or other requirements in a timely manner if we fail to comply in a timely manner public perception of our internal controls could be damaged causing our financial results to suffer and our stock price to decline 

  

the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our ability to grow our business 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel we are particularly dependent upon the continued services of michael hsing our president and chief executive officer who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology also personnel with highly skilled analog and mixedsignal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees our business could be harmed 

  

we currently depend on one thirdparty supplier to provide us with wafers for our products if our wafer supplier fails to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs our revenues and gross margins may decline 

  

we have a supply arrangement with asmc for the production of wafers although certain aspects of our relationship with asmc are contractual many important aspects of this relationship depend on their continued cooperation we began this relationship with asmc in 2001 and commenced volume production at asmc’s facilities in the first half of 2003 in october 2004 o2 sued asmc for patent infringement based on its manufacture of our products and it is possible that our relationship with asmc could be materially and adversely affected by the o2 litigation 

  

in addition the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on 

  

each wafer to be nonfunctional thereby reducing yields the failure of asmc to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenues 

  

although we provide asmc with rolling forecasts of our production requirements their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity of the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause asmc to reduce capacity available to us asmc may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customers’ requirements if asmc extends lead times limits supplies or increases prices due to capacity constraints or other factors our revenues and gross margins may decline 

  

further as is common in the semiconductor industry our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice we are required under our agreement with asmc to order wafers at least three months in advance if we cancel these orders after asmc’s commencement of manufacturing which generally occurs six to fourteen weeks before scheduled delivery of the wafers we must pay cancellation fees to asmc if our customers cancel orders after we have ordered the corresponding wafers from asmc we may be forced to incur cancellation fees or to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell which would adversely affect our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated 

  

all of our products are assembled by thirdparty subcontractors and a small percentage of our testing is performed by thirdparty subcontractors we do not have any ongoing agreements with these subcontractors as a result we may not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality also due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

  

failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete 

  

we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty to protect our technology knowhow and processes despite the precautions we take it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we intend to continue protecting our proprietary technology including through patents there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights that our patent applications will lead to issued patents that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies or that our patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others furthermore the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our business 

  

we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from direct or indirect sales to foreign customers and have significant foreign operations which may expose us to political regulatory economic foreign exchange and operational risks 

  

we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from direct or indirect sales to foreign customers including 989 for 2004 from sales either directly or through distribution arrangements to parties located in asia a majority of which represents revenues from parties with whom we have distribution arrangements for resale to users of our products in taiwan as a result we are subject to increased risks due to this concentration of business and operations there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive government regulation and may receive the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china 

  

most of our manufacturing partners including asmc our current foundry are located in china in addition we are currently in the process of establishing a facility in china initially for the testing of our ics the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china china’s government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies new regulations or the readjustment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

in addition the chinese government and provincial and local governments have provided and continue to provide various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china such incentives include tax rebates reduced tax rates favorable lending policies and other measures some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to the facility we are establishing in china any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

for example pursuant to our agreement to establish the facility in chengdu china the local authorities have agreed to pay for design and build our plant and related infrastructure based on our 

  

specifications we have agreed to buy the plant five years after completion for the actual cost of construction prior to the plant purchase we have agreed to make quarterly lease payments which will ultimately be applied against the construction costs due at the end of the five years the local authorities have agreed to ensure that we will obtain all necessary licenses for doing business that we will obtain favorable tax treatment similar to other foreign technology companies and that we will obtain our land use rights additionally we will not require an export license and upon approval by the applicable authorities will be exempt from certain import valueadded taxes and custom duties if at the end of five years we elect not to purchase the plant then the agreement will terminated and the local authorities can take back title to the plant revoke our land use rights and will refund our land purchase price however the local authority will retain all lease payments if any of these terms or incentives is reduced altered or eliminated the profitability of our china facility could be harmed and overall our revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business 

  

we operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design develop manufacture assemble test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets our failure to develop new technologies or to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products which could result in product obsolescence decreased revenues andor a loss of market share to competitors 

  

the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of longterm market demand and future technological developments as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

to the extent that we fail to introduce new products or penetrate new markets our revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenues and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products 

  

the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures must be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales it takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins this sales process which averages 6 to 12 months requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success volume production of products that use our ics if any may not be achieved for an additional 3 to 6 months after an initial sale sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of our lengthy sales cycles we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenues because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenues the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult in addition the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders our sales are made by purchase orders because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales if customer cancellations or product changes occur we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 

  

our products must meet exacting specifications and undetected defects and failures may occur which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk 

  

our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality performance and reliability that our products must meet integrated circuits as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments which might require product replacement or recall we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality performance or reliability problems if defects and failures occur in our products we could experience lost revenues increased costs including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts any of which would harm our operating results 

  

in addition product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products although we currently have insurance there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims 

  

we intend to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 

  

we plan to expand our operations domestically and internationally and may do so through internal growth strategic relationships or acquisitions including but not limited to the establishment of a testing facility in china we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls in addition we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs to manage our growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls if we fail to do so our growth will be limited if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations our business and operating results may be harmed 

  

we compete against many companies with substantially greater financing and other resources and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively 

  

the analog and mixedsignal semiconductor industry is highly competitive and we expect competitive pressures to continue our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will 

  

depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent our ability to introduce new products and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products we compete with several domestic and international semiconductor companies many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products we are in direct and active competition with respect to one or more of our product lines with at least 10 manufacturers of such products of varying size and financial strength the number of our competitors has grown due to expansion of the market segments in which we participate we consider our primary competitors to include intersil corporation linear maxim integrated products micrel microsemi national semiconductor corporation o2 semtech corporation stmicroelectronic and texas instruments we expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants in the semiconductor market 

  

we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 

  

our current backlog may not be indicative of future sales 

  

due to the nature of our business in which order lead times may vary and customers are generally allowed to reschedule or cancel orders on short notice we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future sales our quarterly revenues also depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter because lead times for the manufacturing of our products generally take 6 to 8 weeks we often must build in advance of orders this subjects us to certain risks most notably the possibility that expected sales will not materialize leading to excess inventory which we may be unable to sell to other customers therefore our backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future sales 

  

major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses 

  

our corporate headquarters the production facilities of our thirdparty wafer supplier a portion of our assembly and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake much of our revenues as well as our manufacturers and assemblers are concentrated in southeast asia such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters labor strikes terrorism war political unrest epidemics andor health advisories like sudden acute respiratory syndrome or bird flu could disrupt our operations in addition we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption systemwide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

  

we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities and we may be unable to successfully integrate these companies into our operations which would adversely affect our business 

  

as a part of our business strategy we expect to review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings enhance our design capability or offer other growth opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could use a significant portion of our available cash issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership andor incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities such actions by us could impact our operating results andor the price of our common stock 

  

in addition if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated we may experience disruptions that could harm our business 

  

the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 

  

the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the stock market in general often experiences substantial volatility that is seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

if securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could harm the market price of our stock 

  

if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of common stock in the public market soon after the lockup period ends the market price of our common stock could fall as of december 31 2004 we had outstanding 7785825 freely tradable shares of common stock another 19693392 shares will be eligible for sale in the public market on may 18 2005 which is 180 days from the date of our initial public offering on november 18 2004 all of which are subject to lockup agreements with us andor the underwriters either we or the underwriters may in our respective sole discretion and at any time without notice release all or any portion of the securities from the restrictions imposed by our respective lockup agreements with security holders prior to the expiration of such 180day period additionally 261324 shares are restricted securities that will become eligible for sale in the public market pursuant to rule 144 at various dates in the future the sale of a significant number of these shares could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

  

because of their significant stock ownership our officers and directors will be able to exert significant influence over our future direction 

  

executive officers directors and affiliated entities beneficially own in aggregate approximately 362 of our outstanding common stock additionally jim jones one of our directors is associated with bavp lp which owns approximately 83 of our outstanding common stock these stockholders if acting together would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

o2 micro inc 

  

overview 

  

since november 2000 we have been engaged in multiple legal proceedings against o2 micro inc “o2 micro” and its parent corporation o2 micro international limited “o2 international” we refer to o2 micro and o2 international together as “o2” these proceedings involve various claims and counterclaims in the united states and taiwan by us and o2 alleging patent infringements and misappropriation of trade secrets all of which relate to our ccfl backlight inverter product family although the taiwanese injunction against us specifically named only our mp 1011a and mp 1015 products within that product family the underlying patent dispute involves issues that could affect all of our ccfl backlight inverter products that are used in taiwan in 2004 revenues from our ccfl backlight inverter product family were 219 million or 460 of total revenue of which products used in taiwan represented a significant portion of our revenues in 2004 o2 has also sued a number of other companies in the us and taiwan for patent infringement including purchasers andor users of certain of our products and our wafer manufacturer all of these legal proceedings pose various degrees of risk to our business 

  

regardless of the extent to which these legal actions have been successful or not successful the legal expenses associated with the various actions in the us and taiwan have been high and have had a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations” for more detail on the financial impact these legal actions have had on us 

  

patents at issue 

  

the various litigations arise from patents issued to o2 and us covering products that compete with each other 

  

our patents our patents at issue are i us patent no 6114814 issued to us on november 5 2000 and relating to inverter ics for lcd display products which include for example our ccfl backlight inverter product family “the ‘814 patent” and ii us patent no 6316881 “the ‘881 patent” a continuation of the ‘814 patent that issued to us on november 13 2001 

  

o2’s patents the o2 patents at issue are i us patent no 6259615 b1 issued to o2 international on july 10 2001 and also relating to inverter ics for lcd display products “the ‘615 patent” ii us patent no 6396722 “the ‘722 patent” a continuation of the ‘615 patent that issued to o2 on may 28 2002 iii us patent no 6804129 “the ‘129 patent” a continuation of the ‘615 and ‘722 patents that issued to o2 on october 12 2004 and iv taiwan patent no 152318 issued to o2 international on march 1 2002 which is a counterpart to the ‘615 patent “the ‘318 patent” o2’s original applications for its us ‘615 patent and its taiwan ‘318 patent were substantially similar but some of o2’s claims contained in the ‘318 patent were rejected by the us patent and trademark office and accordingly the us patent was narrowed significantly before issuance the taiwan patent however was not similarly narrowed and was issued in the broader form originally requested 

  

us litigation 

  

various us lawsuits between o2 and us have been consolidated in the us district court for the northern district of california o2 has i claimed that we interfered with o2’s prospective economic advantage and disrupted o2’s customer relationships by misrepresenting the scope of our ‘814 patent ii asked the court to declare that o2 does not infringe our ‘814 patent and that our ‘814 patent is invalid iii claimed that our products infringe its ‘615 patent and iv claimed that we misappropriated 

  

its trade secrets we have i claimed that o2’s products infringe our ‘814 and ‘881 patents and ii asked the court to declare that o2’s ‘615 patent is invalid or not enforceable or that our products do not infringe o2’s ‘615 patent each party denied the allegations in the other party’s complaints and sought damages and an injunction prohibiting the other party from selling its products 

  

in february 2004 and may 2004 the court ruled on these matters as follows i granting summary judgment for us that our products do not infringe the ‘615 patent ii dismissing o2’s claim that we interfered with o2’s economic advantage iii denying o2’s motion for summary judgment that o2’s products do not infringe our ‘814 and ‘881 patents or that those patents are invalid and iv denying both parties’ motions for summary judgment on o2’s trade secret claims we expect o2 to eventually appeal one or more of these rulings to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit o2 could wait to file any such appeal until conclusion of the trial or could ask the trial judge to allow an earlier appeal prior to the trial 

  

the claims remaining after these rulings include i o2’s trade secret claims and ii our infringement claims for injunctive relief only and not for damages trial on these matters is currently scheduled for may 2005 while we believe that our ‘814 and ‘881 patents are valid and that we have not misappropriated any of o2’s trade secrets a court could find differently if the court finds that our ‘814 and ‘881 patents are invalid our competitive position would be severely harmed if the court finds that we have misappropriated o2’s trade secrets we could be liable for damages to o2 andor be enjoined from further misappropriation or use of the alleged trade secrets any award of damages could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 

  

in addition if o2 appeals the rulings in our favor we will at a minimum continue to incur substantial legal expense contesting any such appeal if o2 were to be successful on any such appeals o2’s claims would be remanded for further proceedings potentially including trial if the court were to find that our products infringe the ‘615 patent we could be liable to o2 for damages and could be enjoined from selling our products in the us any such injunction would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations at least for several quarters and possibly for a much longer period of time depending on the extent of any such damage award and the scope and applicability of any such injunction if the court found that we have interfered with o2’s economic advantage we could be liable for damages to o2 which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 

  

in january 2003 o2 filed a lawsuit against sumida corp and taiwan sumida electronics inc in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that sumida’s use of our products in sumida’s products infringes the ‘615 and ‘722 patents we have agreed to assume the defense of sumida pursuant to an indemnity agreement that case has been set for trial for june 2005 

  

in response to o2’s action against sumida in may 2004 we filed a complaint against o2 in the us district court for the northern district of california seeking a declaratory judgment that we do not infringe o2’s ‘722 patent that case has been assigned to the same judge presiding over the litigation over the ‘615 ‘814 and ‘881 patents described above but it has not been consolidated with the earlier case in october 2004 o2 filed a counterclaim for alleged infringement of the ‘722 patent and added our foundry advanced semiconductor manufacturing corporation of shanghai “asmc” as a counterclaim defendant because the litigation is in a very preliminary stage it is difficult to predict how it will proceed or what the ultimate outcome will be no trial date has yet been set in this matter 

  

on or about october 12 2004 o2 filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the eastern district of texas for alleged infringement of the ‘129 patent we have filed an answer and an antitrust and unfair competition counterclaim against o2 because the litigation is in a very preliminary stage it is difficult to predict how it will proceed or what the ultimate outcome will be 

  

if the california court were to find that our products infringe the ‘722 patent or if a court were to find that our products infringe the ‘129 patent we could be liable to o2 for damages and could be enjoined from selling our products in the us any such injunction would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations at least for several quarters and possibly for a much longer period of time depending on the extent of any such damage award and the scope and applicability of any such injunction 

  

taiwan litigation 

  

summary in addition to the us litigation described above o2 has brought legal proceedings against us in taiwan based upon its ‘318 patent unlike the us where a party seeking a preliminary injunction must first file a lawsuit on the merits of the underlying claim in taiwan it is possible for a party to be granted a preliminary injunction without first filing a lawsuit on the merits in january 2003 upon o2’s request the shihlin district court in taiwan issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing designing displaying importing or selling our mp1011a and mp1015 products in taiwan either directly or through a third party acting at our request 

  

we believe that we have at all times conducted our business in compliance with the injunction nevertheless o2 has attempted repeatedly various actions to persuade the court that we have violated it the court has not yet issued a ruling on o2’s motion we have also taken several legal actions in an attempt to have the injunction lifted andor to have o2’s ‘318 patent declared invalid these actions include appealing the shihlin district court’s injunction initiating proceedings with the taiwan intellectual property office tipo to invalidate o2’s ‘318 patent and seeking counterinjunctions from the taipei district court some of those actions have produced legal outcomes in our favor and others have not but none has yet resulted in the lifting of the injunction or the invalidation of o2’s patent we intend to continue pursuing the available legal avenues to achieve these objectives 

  

in june 2003 o2 filed a lawsuit against us in the shihlin district court for a resolution on the merits of o2’s claim that our products infringe o2’s ‘318 patent that lawsuit was dismissed in april 2004 but o2 filed a similar lawsuit in taipei district court shortly thereafter 

  

in august 2004 the tipo issued a letter ordering o2 to amend its ‘318 patent the tipo letter indicated that two of the three independent claims asserted by o2 lacked inventive steps and therefore should be amended or deleted by o2 as to the third independent claim the tipo indicated that certain corrections should be made but has not at this time indicated that the third independent claim should be amended or deleted in december 2004 o2 filed its amendment on its ‘318 patent and we have responded with our comments on its amendment in february 2005 tipo has not made a decision on whether o2’s amendment is adequate if following such correction the third claim is upheld by the tipo such claim could be sufficient for o2 to continue its patent claims against us in july 2004 the taiwan supreme court issued a ruling that remanded our motion for a retrial of o2’s preliminary injunction against us to the taiwan high court in that ruling the taiwan supreme court indicated that in order for o2 to be entitled to sue for or seek injunctions relating to infringement of its patents under taiwan patent law it must be demonstrated whether o2’s country of incorporation the cayman islands offers similar reciprocal protections to taiwanese individuals and entities under its patent law the court has not yet ruled on this issue 

  

our counterinjunctions against o2 we have obtained two defensive counterinjunctions from the taipei district court the first of which prohibits o2 from interfering with our or other parties’ use of our mp 1011a and mp1015 products the second injunction prohibits o2 from interfering with the manufacture sale use or importation by either us or a third party of a number of our other products which are specifically enumerated in the injunction although the mp1010b is not specifically addressed we posted cash bonds of approximately 61 million including the 90000 bond 

  

discussed below with the taipei district court in connection with the two defensive preliminary injunctions these bonds are currently recorded as restricted assets on our balance sheet if we do not prevail at trial we might have to forfeit some or all of these bonds any such forfeiture would be an expense in the quarter in which the outcome of the trial is probable and reasonably estimable a forfeiture of any substantial part of the bonds would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position for that quarter 

  

o2’s other actions against us in august 2003 november 2003 and march 2004 o2 filed for provisional seizures against us in the shihlin district court and taipei district court which would entitle o2 to seize up to approximately 19 million of our assets in taiwan including but not limited to mp 1011a and mp 1015 parts this 19 million figure represents the amount of damages o2 has currently claimed in its taiwan patent infringement suit against us although at various times in the past o2 has claimed substantially higher damage amounts the court granted the provisional seizures the execution of the first provisional seizure was exempted because we posted a bond in the amount of approximately 90000 we elected not to post a bond to exempt the second and third provisional seizure orders and the court seized property from our taiwan office we have appealed the second and third provisional seizures to the supreme court one of our appeals involving the third seizure has been denied but the other appeal regarding the second seizure is still pending the second and third provisional seizure orders have not yet been executed to the satisfaction of o2’s demand and accordingly o2 may continue to request that the court seize our property under these orders o2 has applied for court orders allowing o2 to seize payments from our customers if such payments are made in taiwan to us the court has granted two such orders against two of our customers asustek and sumida but it is our understanding that o2 thus far has not been successful in seizing or attaching property of either of these customers the seized assets would be released to us upon the earlier to occur of i if and when the provisional seizure orders were to be revoked by the court or upon o2’s application or ii if and when the lawsuits on the merits filed by o2 were to be dismissed and such dismissal were final and conclusive however if o2 were to receive final judgment in its favor on the merits o2 would be able to file an application to sell the seized assets by auction to cover any damages that the court determines o2 to have suffered 

  

trial on the merits in taiwan we could lose at trial on the question of whether our products infringe o2’s ‘318 patent although o2 has named only our mp1011a and mp1015 products in its lawsuit if the court were to conclude that those products infringe the ‘318 patent the court could also conclude that many of our newer products including the 1010b and other ccfl products that are physically similar to the mp1011a andor the mp1015 infringe o2’s ‘318 patent we do not believe that the ‘318 patent is a valid patent or that any of our products infringe the ‘318 patent but a court may come to a different conclusion o2’s original applications for its us ‘615 patent and its taiwan ‘318 patent were substantially similar but some of o2’s claims contained in the ‘318 patent were rejected by the us patent and trademark office since the claims in the ‘318 patent are formulated more broadly than those of the ‘615 patent the summary judgment in the us that our products do not infringe the ‘615 patent may not be as helpful to us in the ‘318 case as it might be if the patents were identical 

  

if the court were to conclude that any of our products infringe the ‘318 patent and if the ‘318 patent were valid we could be liable to o2 for damages based on past sales and could further be permanently enjoined from selling those products directly or through distribution arrangements for use in taiwan although many system and module manufacturers who use our products have shifted and are continuing to shift their manufacturing from taiwan to china a significant portion of our expected future revenue over the next several years is expected to come from users of our ccfl backlight inverter product family in taiwan a final judgment awarded by a court prohibiting direct or indirect sales of our mp 1011a or mp 1015 products into taiwan would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for at least several quarters while we work to transition 

  

customers to alternative noninfringing products we cannot be sure that we could successfully effect such a transition if we are permanently enjoined from selling other newer products into taiwan this would have an immediate drastic and adverse effect on our ability to continue in our business as presently conducted 

  

o2’s lawsuits against our customers and other third parties 

  

in addition to lawsuits between o2 and us o2 has also initiated numerous legal proceedings in taiwan and in the united states against other companies which have been purchasers supplier andor users of our products we are aware that in some cases those companies have been enjoined from using mp1011a and mp1015 products imported into taiwan in at least two cases preliminary injunctions were upheld by district courts in taiwan injunctions against endusers of our products necessarily reduce the demand for our products potentially leading to reduced sales under certain circumstances we have agreed to indemnify certain customers and manufacturer against patent infringement continued expenditure of our funds in defending customers and manufacturer against o2’s lawsuits could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

  

additional o2 patents 

  

we are aware that o2 has recently been issued at least one other us patent that is a continuation of the patents it has accused us of infringing has also filed for a us patent that would be a continuation of the patents it has accused us of infringing and has filed for related patents in other asian countries we are not aware that any foreign patents have been issued in response to these patent applications and do not know when if ever any such patent will issue nevertheless we expect o2 may pursue claims against us based on this additional issued us patent or any other additional us or foreign patents that o2 may obtain in the future in this regard o2 often has sued us on additional patents as they have issued including suits on two additional patents filed in october 2004 depending on the scope and severity of those claims any injunctions that may be issued against us or damages that may be awarded against us could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

linear technology corporation 

  

on may 3 2004 linear filed a complaint for misappropriation of trade secrets unfair business practices california common law unfair competition breach of agreement and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing against us and timothy cox a former linear employee who currently works for us in the superior court of the state of california santa clara county effective january 25 2005 we entered into an agreement to settle the action on terms mutually satisfactory to the parties and the case was dismissed 

  

on july 16 2004 linear filed a complaint with the us international trade commission itc under section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 the investigation is now captioned in the matter of certain voltage regulator circuits components thereof and products containing same inv no 337ta521 linear filed a letter supplementing the complaint on august 10 2004 in its complaint linear alleges that two of our products the mp1556 a product within our dc to dc converter product family and the ev0063 the evaluation board containing the mp1556 infringe its us patent nos 5481178 and 6580258 linear subsequently supplemented its infringement allegations to include additional products and products under development linear has examined numerous other products within our dc to dc converter product family that do not employ the particular circuitry utilized in the mp1556 and has not accused those other products of infringement therefore linear’s allegations appear limited to the particular circuitry used in a relatively small number of products and products under development linear alleges that we violated section 337 because we imported these allegedly infringing products 

  

into the united states sold them for importation in the united states andor sold them within the united states after importing them the complaint requests that the itc institute an investigation and after the investigation issue an exclusion order and a cease and desist order prohibiting specific unfair acts found to be illegal in the investigation on august 11 2004 the itc ordered that an investigation be instituted to determine whether there has been a violation of section 337 as alleged in the complaint we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims and are defending vigorously against them the matter had been scheduled for trial before the itc commencing march 30 however at linear’s request due to a conflict with another trial the judge has rescheduled the trial to commence june 22 2005 if linear is successful in securing an exclusion order against the mp1556 ev0063 and potentially other products such an exclusion order would prevent such products from being shipped into the united states and would have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

microsemi corporation 

  

on october 7 2004 microsemi filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the central district of california the lawsuit identifies four patents—us patent nos 5615093 5923129 5930121 and 6198234—that purportedly are now owned by microsemi and alleges that we infringe those patents the complaint describes the patents as covering ‘display lamp driver’ technologies which facilitate the lighting of electronic displays found in laptop and personal computers personal digital assistants and televisions as well as countless lcd screens 

  

the complaint does not identify which claims in the four patents are allegedly infringed nor does it identify which of our products supposedly infringe the patent claims the complaint requests an injunction to prevent us from allegedly infringing the patents as well as unspecified damages attorneys’ fees costs and expenses we have filed an answer and counterclaim denying infringement and seeking a declaration that we do not infringe the patents andor that the patents are invalid the court has scheduled a case management conference hearing for april 18 2005 

  

based upon the description of the technology contained in microsemi’s complaint and microsemi’s responses to discovery requests we understand that microsemi will contend that one or more of our ccfl backlight inverter products infringes its patents because the litigation is in a preliminary stage it is difficult to predict how it will proceed or what the ultimate outcome will be if we do not prevail in the litigation we could be ordered to pay monetary damages and we could be enjoined from selling one or more of our ccfl backlight inverter products into the us either directly or indirectly in 2004 revenues from our ccfl backlight inverter product family were 219 million respectively or 460 of total revenue because many of our products are sold indirectly by our customers back into the us a us injunction covering one or more of our products would likely substantially reduce sales of those products any of the results described above would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition 

  

micrel corporation 

  

on november 10 2004 micrel filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of california the lawsuit identifies two patents—us patent nos 5517046 entitled “high voltage lateral dmos device with enhanced drift region” and 5556796 entitled “selfalignment technique for forming junction isolation and wells”—that purportedly are owned by micrel and alleges that our products infringe those patents michael hsing our chief executive officer and another of our employees are named inventors on both of micrel’s patents and jim moyer our chief design engineer is a named inventor on one of them micrel’s complaint does not identify which claims in the two patents are allegedly infringed nor does it identify which of our products allegedly infringe the patent claims however because micrel’s patents relate to semiconductor manufacturing processes and semiconductor design elements rather than a specific 

  

device all of our products could potentially be implicated the complaint requests among other remedies preliminary and permanent injunctions to prevent us from allegedly infringing the patents as well as unspecified damages attorneys’ fees costs and expenses 

  

on november 29 2004 micrel filed an amended complaint adding causes of action for alleged statutory and common law misappropriation of trade secrets alleged breach of confidentiality agreements by messrs hsing and moyer both former employees of micrel and alleged violation of california’s unfair competition law the amended complaint also adds messrs hsing and moyer as defendants micrel’s amended complaint adds requests for damages attributable to the alleged misappropriation of micrel’s trade secrets and alleged violation of the confidentiality agreements for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent our future use of micrel’s alleged trade secrets and for attorneys’ fees and costs we have filed a motion to dismiss these claims on statute of limitations and preemption grounds 

  

the court has not set a trial date and discovery has not yet begun because the litigation is in a very preliminary stage it is difficult to predict how it will proceed or what the ultimate outcome will be we have however conducted an initial review of the micrel patents and compared them with the manufacturing processes and design elements we use for our products we have also conducted an initial review of the causes of action added by the amended complaint based on this initial review we believe that we have meritorious defenses to all of micrel’s claims if we do not prevail in the litigation we could be ordered to pay to micrel substantial monetary damages including restitution disgorgement of profits and punitive damages and we could be enjoined from selling one or more of our products into the us either directly or indirectly because many of our products are sold indirectly by our customers back into the us a us injunction covering one or more of our products would likely substantially reduce sales of those products any of these results would have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and any injunction that prohibits us from selling significant products for any length of time would have an immediate and drastic negative effect on our business and results of operations

the sales and issuances of securities described in paragraphs 1 and 2 above were exempt from registration under the securities act by virtue of section 42 of the securities act or by virtue of rule 701 promulgated under the securities act in that they were offered and sold either pursuant to a written compensatory benefit plan or pursuant to a written contract relating to compensation as provided by rule 701 

  

use of proceeds 

  

on november 18 2004 our registration statement on form s1 registration no 333117327 was declared effective for our initial public offering our initial public offering of common stock occurred on november 18 2004 this offering terminated upon the expiration of the unexercised portion of the underwriters’ overallotment option therefore 39175 of the registered shares covered by the underwriters’ overallotment option were not sold the underwriting syndicate was managed by goldman sachs  co merrill lynch  co deutsche bank securities and piper jaffray 

  

under this registration statement we registered 6325000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of 850 per share including 825000 shares subject to the underwriters’ overallotment option which option was exercised in part with an aggregate public offering price of approximately 538 million we registered 4825000 of these shares on the company’s behalf and 1500000 of these shares on behalf of certain of our selling stockholders 

  

the sale of 4785825 shares of common stock by the company including 785825 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of the overallotment option resulted in aggregate gross proceeds to the company of approximately 407 million approximately 28 million of which the company applied to underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately 29 million of which the company applied to related costs as a result the company received net proceeds of approximately 349 million from the offering 

  

as of march 1 2005 we had invested the 349 million in net proceeds from the offering in government securities and corporate preferred equities we intend to use these proceeds for general corporate purposes including working capital research and development general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures including the facility in china described in “business—manufacturing” which facility involves a commitment of at least 5 million we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to fund possible investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses products or technologies or in establishing joint ventures although none is currently contemplated 

  




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report on form 10k this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties please see “forwardlooking statements” above our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report on form 10k particularly under the heading “trends risks and uncertainties” 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable inventories income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources because these estimates can vary depending on the situation actual results may differ from the estimates 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab 101a and 101b “sab 101” and staff accounting bulletin no104 revenue recognition collectively referred to as “sab 104” issued by the staff of the sec  sab 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the fee is fixed and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured determination of criteria 3 and 4 are based on management’s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees the application of these criteria has resulted in our recognizing revenue upon shipment when title passes to most customers but in the case of one third party who accounted for 30 of our revenue in 2003 we have recognized revenue upon its sale of our products to its customers sell through basis we discontinued using this third party in march 2004 should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 

  

the majority of our sales are made through distribution arrangements with third parties although some of these arrangements include stock rotation rights that permit the return of up to 5 of the previous six months’ purchases no more than once every six months we have not experienced any significant returns pursuant to these provisions our normal payment terms with our distributors are 30 days from invoice date and our arrangements with our largest distributors do not include price protection provisions although some of our arrangements with smaller distributors include price protection provisions permitting them a credit for unsold inventory if we reduce our list prices we have not experienced any significant claims pursuant to these provisions in addition terms of our significant distribution agreements include the nonexclusive right to sell and the agreement to use best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products in certain regions of the world and the ability to terminate the agreement by either party with three months notice we provide a standard 90day warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods provide replacements at no charge to the customer or refund amounts to the customer for defective products estimated sales returns and warranty costs based on historical experience by product are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized we formerly had one distribution arrangement with a third party with extended payment terms these terms were the lesser of 60 days or upon receipt of end customer payment by the third party revenue for this arrangement was recognized on a sellthrough basis when the goods were shipped by the third party to the end customer under such distribution arrangement the third party did not stock inventory of our products 

  

inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the actual costs of our inventory or its current estimated market value we write down inventory for obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

  

accounting for income taxes  statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “sfas no 109” accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we also recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 

  

our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting or tax laws in the united states or us or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had a valuation allowance of approximately 48 million attributable principally to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on the company’s determination during the fourth quarter of 2004 that the realization of the deferred tax assets was more likely than not the recognition of a benefit of 10 million was recorded as a reduction to income tax expense should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination would be made 

  

contingencies  from time to time we receive notices or become aware that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the intellectual property rights of others when this occurs we will investigate and determine whether a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5 sfas 5 “accounting for contingencies” should be recorded in making this determination management may depending on the nature of the matter consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts based on the management’s judgment and given the facts and circumstances in each matter we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated should a loss be probable and estimable we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas 5 in determining the amount of a contingent loss we take into account advice received from the technical experts in each specific matter the status of legal proceedings settlement negotiations which may be ongoing prior case history and other factors should the judgments and estimates made by management be incorrect we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations alternatively if the judgments and estimates made by management are incorrect and a particular contingent loss does not occur the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable outcome to operations 

  

accounting for stockbased compensation our stockbased employee compensation plans are described more fully in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we account for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations we amortize deferred stockbased compensation over the vesting periods of the related options which are generally four years in accordance with fasb interpretation no 28 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 15 and 25  

  

we have recorded deferred stockbased compensation representing the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock at the grant date and the option exercise price we determined the fair market value of our common stock based upon several factors including trends in the broad market for technology stocks and the expected valuation we would obtain in an initial public offering had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the fair market value of our common stock materially different amounts of stockbased compensation could have been reported 

  

pro forma information regarding net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is required in order to show our net loss as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation as amended by sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation transition and disclosure  this information is contained in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements the fair value of options issued pursuant to our option plan at the grant date were estimated using the blackscholes optionpricing model 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 46 fin 46 consolidation of variable interest entities  in january 2003 and a revised interpretation of fin 46 fin 46r in december 2003 fin 46 requires certain variable interest entities vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties the provisions of fin 46 are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january 31 2003 since january 31 2003 we have not invested in any entities we believe are variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary for all arrangements entered into after january 31 2003 we are required to continue to apply fin 46 through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004 we are required to adopt the provisions of fin 46r for those arrangements in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 for arrangements entered into prior to february 1 2003 we were required to adopt the provisions of 

  

fin 46r in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 the adoption of fin 46r did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 150 “sfas 150” accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 sfas 150 is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption the adoption of sfas 150 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2003 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 104 “sab 104” revenue recognition  sab 104 updates portions of existing interpretative guidance in order to make this guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations the adoption of sab 104 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

on december 16 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas 123r” sfas 123r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of opinion 25 to stock compensation awards issued to employees rather the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 

  

we have not yet quantified the effects of the adoption of sfas 123r but it is expected that the new standard may result in significant stockbased compensation expense the actual effects of adopting sfas 123r will be dependent on numerous factors including but not limited to the valuation model chosen by us to value stockbased awards the assumed award forfeiture rate the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period and the transition method as described below chosen for adopting sfas 123r 

  

sfas 123r will be effective for our fiscal quarter beginning july 1 2005 and requires the use of the modified prospective application method under this method sfas 123r is applied to new awards and to awards modified repurchased or cancelled after the effective date additionally compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grantdate fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas123 in addition companies may use the modified retrospective application method this method may be applied to all prior years for which the original sfas 123 was effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption if the modified retrospective application method is applied financial statements for prior periods shall be adjusted to give effect to the fairvaluebased method of accounting for awards on a consistent basis with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods under the original sfas 123 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 151 inventory costs sfas 151 an amendment of arb no 43 adoption is required for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 sfas 151 requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material be recognized as currentperiod expenses in addition sfas 151 requires that the allocation of production overhead be based on normal capacity we do not expect the adoption of sfas 151 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

  

results of operations 

  

the table below states the income statement items as a percentage of revenues and provides the percentage change of such items compared to the prior fiscal year amount 

  

   

revenues revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 were 476 million an increase of 234 million or 966 over 242 million for the previous fiscal year this was due to higher unit shipments for several new products introduced in 2002 and 2003 resulting in volume shipments that took place in 2004 our products gaining market share and growth of the computer and consumer electronic markets revenues from our dc to dc converter product family increased 139 million or 2508 due to higher volume shipments resulting from increased order rates for existing and new products for shipments into the computer and consumer electronic communications markets revenues from our ccfl backlight inverter product family increased 50 million or 297 due to higher volume shipments resulting from increased order rates for existing and new products revenues from our led driver product family increased 35 million or 2402 due to higher volume shipments resulting from increased order rates for existing and new products revenues for our audio amplifier product family increased 10 million or 3165 due to an increased demand for our existing products 

  

revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 were 242 million compared to 122 million for the year ended december 31 2002 an increase of 983 this increase was due to an increase in revenues from our ccfl backlight inverter and dc to dc converter product families the increase in revenues from our ccfl backlight inverter product family was due to several new product releases and increased demand for our existing products this resulted in higher unit volumes which were partially offset by a decline in average selling prices the increase in revenues from our dc to dc converter product family was due to an increased number of new product offerings for the computer consumer electronics and communications markets volume sales began in the third quarter of 2003 for our dc to dc product family revenues from our audio amplifier product family accounted for 13 and 140 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 respectively revenues for our audio amplifier product family for the year ended december 31 2002 were primarily driven by a nonrecurring order by one customer 

  

geographically international revenues were 460 million or 967 of net revenues for year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 295 million as compared to international revenues of 165 million or 683 of net revenues for the same period in fiscal 2003 international revenues consist of shipments to countries outside the united states 

  

although 33 and 317 of direct sales are to customers in the united states in 2004 and 2003 the majority of these shipments were made to a third party in the us with whom we had a distribution arrangement who in turn shipped to customers in asia our distribution arrangement with this third party was terminated in march 2004 as a result our overall revenues from both direct sales and sales through third parties into asia were 989 and 986 in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

the following table illustrates changes in our revenues by product family amounts in thousands 

  

    

gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenues or gross margin was 590 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 548 for year ended december 31 2003 the increase in gross margin was primarily due volume efficiencies attributable to a growth in unit shipments from our dc to dc converter product family and volume efficiencies attributable to a growth in unit shipments from our ccfl backlight inverter product family the gross margin was adversely impacted by 810000 or 17 for stock compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 180000 or 07 for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

gross margin was 548 for the year ended december 31 2003 compared with 441 for the year ended december 31 2002 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower per unit costs associated with volume efficiencies attributable to a growth in unit shipments from our ccfl backlight inverter product family and the introduction of several new products in our dc to dc converter product in addition we reduced our manufacturing costs by converting to a lower cost foundry in the first half of 2003 reducing our assembly costs and improving our test yields the gross margin was adversely impacted by 180000 or 07 for stock compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

research and development 

  

   

research and development expenses were 77 million or 162 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 and 55 million or 227 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase of 22 million was due to an increase in personnel and expenses associated with new product development activities 

  

research and development expenses increased to 55 million or 227 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 from 45 million or 365 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 this dollar increase of 232 was primarily due to higher compensation and related costs of 08 million driven by increases in our engineering headcount 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

   

selling general and administrative expenses were 71 million or 148 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 and 39 million or 162 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase of 32 million was due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel in the united states taiwan and china to support our increase in customers and growth in revenues in addition general and administrative expenses increased due to an increase in professional fees such as legal audit tax and director and officer liability insurance sales general and administrative expenses could increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future as a result of ongoing efforts to comply with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

selling general and administrative expenses were 39 million or 162 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 and 24 million or 200 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 the increase of 15 million was due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel in the united states taiwan and china which started in the second quarter of 2003 to support our increase in customers and growth in revenues in addition general and administrative expenses increased in administrative personnel higher insurance costs and professional service costs such as legal audit and tax 

  

patent litigation 

  

   

patent litigation expenses were 78 million or 165 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 and 43 million or 179 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2003 the dollar increase was due to the increase in activities associated with multiple lawsuits in the us and taiwan in addition to the o2 lawsuit that existed in 2003 three more patent infringement suits were brought against us in 2004 by linear microsemi and micrel for a more complete description of our litigation matters please read “legal proceedings” beginning on page 25 

  

patent litigation expenses increased to 43 million or 179 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 from 16 million or 131 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 this dollar increase of 1703 was due to increased activities associated with multiple lawsuits in the us and taiwan with o2 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

   

stockbased compensation expense was 110 million or 232 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 and 27 million or 113 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase is due to the grants of options during second half of 2003 and first half of 2004 with exercise prices below the deemed fair value of our common stock resulting in deferred stock compensation which resulted in an increase in amortization during 2004 

  

in october 2004 our stockholders approved an issuance of restricted stock of 176740 shares which resulted in additional amortization of stockbased compensation expense of 195150 in 2004 

  

future amortization of stockbased compensation for outstanding stock options and restricted stock at december 31 2004 will be 34 million for the six months ended june 30 2005 after which time the company will be required to adopt sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment and report stock compensation based on the fair values of the instruments 

  

stockbased compensation allocated to sales general and administrative expenses increased to 59 million in 2004 from 18 million in 2003 this increase is primarily due to current year option grants to sales administrative personnel board members and consultants in addition stockbased compensation of 02 million has been recorded as an offset to revenue in 2003 for stock options granted to a nonemployee in connection with a distribution arrangement 

  

we have also granted stock options to individuals employed by certain of our customers these options are valued using the fair value method and the related charge of 327487 in the fourth quarter of 2004 is classified as a reduction of revenue in the statement of operations based on the fair value 

  

of our common stock at december 31 2004 additional charges of approximately 37934 will be recorded in 2005 over the remaining vesting periods the ultimate amount of this charge in 2005 will vary depending on changes in the fair market value of our common stock 

  

interest and other income net interest and other income net was 02 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 02 million for the year ended december 31 2003 interest income is earned on our cash and shortertem investments 

  

interest and other income was 02 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 02 million for the year ended december 31 2002 interest income is earned on our cash and shortterm investments 

  

interest and other expense net interest and other expense net was 01 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and for the year ended december 31 2003 we did not have interest or other expense 

  

for the year ended december 31 2003 we did not have interest or other expense for the year ended december 31 2002 we had 01 million in interest and other expense as a result of our notes payable and our credit line the notes along with all related interest were converted to preferred stock in 2002 and the credit line was repaid in 2002 

  

income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2004 we had an income tax benefit of 10 million this resulted primarily from the reversal of our remaining deferred tax valuation allowance as realization of our deferred tax assets is now more likely than not as the company has cumulative taxable income over the current and preceding two years 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had working capital of 521 million including cash and cash equivalents of 320 million and shortterm investments of 170 million compared to working capital of 167 million including cash and cash equivalents of 116 million and shortterm investments of 15 million as of december 31 2003 we have financed our growth primarily with proceeds from the issuance of preferred and common stock and from operating activities in november 2004 we received total proceeds of 349 million net of related issuance fees and estimated offering costs from our initial public offering we believe that our current cash cash equivalents and investments as well as cash flows from operations will be sufficient to continue our operations and meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months

as a deposit to a court in taiwan relating to the o2 patent litigation and increased our accounts receivable by 33 million which was offset by 31 million in stock compensation expense a noncash transaction the use of cash in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was primarily due to our net loss of 32 million we increased our accounts receivable by 02 million inventory by 07 million and prepaid and other by 02 million which was offset by 08 million increase in accounts payable and 06 million in depreciation a noncash transaction
