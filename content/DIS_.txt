media and entertainment distribution strategy 

the company has significantly increased its focus on distribution of content via our own dtc streaming services relative to traditional distribution of content in general film content was traditionally distributed first in the theatrical market followed by the home entertainment market and then in the tvsvod market in general episodic television content was traditionally launched on our domestic linear networks and licensed for use globally in other tvsvod windows although the company continues to monetize a significant amount of its content in the traditional manner our focus on our own dtc distribution has had a number of impacts including but not limited to 

• in some cases we are producing exclusive content for our dtc streaming services 

• rather than selling our content in the tvsvod market we generally distribute it on our dtc streaming services and 

• in part because of the impact of covid19 on theatrical markets around the world we may alter our traditional theatrical distribution approach for example by making a film available on our dtc streaming services at the same time it is in theaters or shortly thereafter eg premier access 

over time all else being equal these impacts will tend to increase revenue and costs at directtoconsumer and reduce revenue and costs at content saleslicensing and linear networks our distribution approach is based on flexibility in our windowing strategy and we may change our original launch and distribution strategy for any particular piece of content distribution decisions may impact revenues and viewership and the allocation of costs to our businessesdistribution platforms particularly programming production and marketing costs depends on the distribution approach

• dual networks  fcc rules currently prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks — abc cbs fox and nbc — from being under common ownership or control 

• regulation of programming  the fcc regulates broadcast programming by among other things banning “indecent” programming regulating political advertising and imposing commercial time limits during children’s programming penalties for broadcasting indecent programming can be over 400000 per indecent utterance or image per station 

federal legislation and fcc rules also limit the amount of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast or cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger in addition broadcast stations are generally required to provide an average of three hours per week of programming that has as a “significant purpose” meeting the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and younger fcc rules also give television station owners the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance 

• cable and satellite carriage of broadcast television stations with respect to mvpds operating within a television station’s designated market area fcc rules require that every three years each television station elect either “must carry” status pursuant to which mvpds generally must carry a local television station in the station’s market or “retransmission consent” status pursuant to which the mvpds must negotiate with the television station to obtain the consent of the television station prior to carrying its signal the abc owned television stations have historically elected retransmission consent 

• cable and satellite carriage of programming the communications act and fcc rules regulate some aspects of negotiations between programmers and distributors regarding the carriage of networks by cable and satellite distribution companies and some cable and satellite distribution companies have sought regulation of additional aspects of the carriage of programming on their systems new legislation court action or regulation in this area could have an impact on the company’s operations 

the foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act other legislation and specific fcc rules and policies reference should be made to the communications act other legislation fcc rules and public notices and rulings of the fcc for further information concerning the nature and extent of the fcc’s regulatory authority 

fcc laws and regulations are subject to change and the company generally cannot predict whether new legislation court action or regulations or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations would have an adverse impact on our operations

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as large and complex as the company a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the sec the most significant factors affecting our business include the following 

business economic market and operating condition risks 

the adverse impact of covid19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue 

since early 2020 the world has been and continues to be impacted by covid19 and its variants covid19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways most significantly at dpep where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended in addition at dmed we delayed or in some cases shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content collectively our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue operations have resumed at various points since may 2020 with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021 although operations resumed many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from covid19 such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses capacity restrictions and closures including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets and disruptions of content production activities 

covid19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our linear networks businesses and change consumer preferences for example covid19 impacts have changed and may continue to change consumer behavior and consumption patterns such as theatergoing to watch movies some industries in which our customers operate such as theatrical distribution retail and travel have experienced and could continue to experience contraction and financial distress which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward 

our mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of covid19 on our businesses have had or may continue to have negative impacts for example in response to covid19 impacts we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations in addition we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of covid19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses such as raising additional financing not declaring future dividends further suspending or reducing capital spending reducing film and television content investments implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy these and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses additionally there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of covid19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing 

geographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses including our production operations our operations could be suspended resuspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to covid19 such as the expansion of the omicron subvariants or other variants and other future health outbreaks and pandemics for example our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of covid19 some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant covid19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees customers or others interacting with our businesses including our supply chain 

the impacts of covid19 to our business have generally amplified or reduced our ability to mitigate the other risks discussed in our filings with the sec and our remediation efforts may not be successful 

covid19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses covid19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will in turn depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of covid19 and among other things the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to covid19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward 

changes in us global and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses 

a decline in economic conditions such as recession economic downturn andor inflationary conditions in the us and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand andor expenses for any of our businesses thus reducing our revenue and earnings past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts purchases 

of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations performance of our home entertainment releases and purchases of companybranded consumer products and similar impacts can be expected as such conditions recur the current decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming purchases of and prices for advertising on our dtc products or subscription levels for our cable programming or dtc products while also increasing the prices we pay for goods services and labor economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us in addition an increase in price levels generally or in price levels in a particular sector such as current inflation in the domestic and global energy sector and other pronounced price increases generally and in certain other sectors could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer which could also adversely affect our revenues and at the same time increase our costs a decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our business plans such as our plans to realign our cost structure and for the new dtc adsupported service pricing structure and price increases in addition actions to reduce inflation including raising interest rates increase our cost of borrowing which in turn could make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments on favorable terms further global economic conditions may impact foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar the current or continued strength in the value of the us dollar has adversely impacted the us dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and may reduce international demand for our products and services a decrease in the value of the us dollar may increase our labor supply or other costs in nonus markets although we hedge exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact particularly in periods of sustained us dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies further economic or political conditions in countries outside the us also have reduced and could continue to reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries broader supply chain delays such as those currently impacting global distribution may further exacerbate current inflationary pressures and impact our ability to sell and deliver goods or otherwise disrupt our operations the adverse impact on our businesses of the decline in economic conditions will depend in part on its severity and duration and our ability to mitigate the impacts of this decline on our businesses will be limited 

changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products 

the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies new technologies affect the demand for our products the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams the sources and nature of competing content offerings the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences this trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution as evidenced by the industrywide decline in ratings for broadcast television the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels including for a number of our networks in addition theatergoing to watch movies currently is and may continue to be below precovid19 levels declines in linear viewership have resulted in decreased advertising revenue in order to respond to these developments we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models most recently by developing investing in and acquiring dtc products initiating plans to again reorganize our media and entertainment businesses to advance our dtc strategies and developing next generation storytelling offerings there can be no assurance that our dtc offerings next generation storytelling offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes in addition declines in certain traditional forms of distribution may increase the cost of content allocable to our dtc offerings negatively impacting the profitability of our dtc offerings we expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources particularly as we expand our dtc offerings to date we have experienced significant losses in our dtc businesses there can be no assurance that the dtc model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be profitable or as profitable as our existing or historic business models 

misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment travel and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

our businesses create entertainment travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create compelling content which may be distributed among other ways through broadcast cable internet or cellular technology theme park attractions hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content the success of our theme parks resorts cruise ships and experiences as well as our theatrical releases depends on demand for public or outofhome 

entertainment experiences demand for certain of our outofhome entertainment experiences such as theatergoing to watch movies has not returned to prepandemic levels and covid19 may continue to impact consumer tastes and preferences in addition many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the us the success of our businesses therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the us moreover we must often invest substantial amounts in content production and acquisition acquisition of sports rights theme park attractions cruise ships or hotels and other facilities or customer facing platforms before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance and these products may be introduced into a significantly different market or economic or social climate from the one we anticipated at the time of the investment decisions if our entertainment offerings and products including our content offerings which have been impacted by covid19 and may in the future be impacted by covid19 developments or other health outbreaks or pandemics as well as our methods to make our offerings and products available to consumers do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance our revenue may decline decline further or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby further adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses further consumers’ perceptions of our position on matters of public interest including our efforts to achieve certain of our environmental and social goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands consumer tastes and preferences impact among other items revenue from advertising sales which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air affiliate fees subscription fees theatrical film receipts the license of rights to other distributors theme park admissions hotel room charges and merchandise food and beverage sales sales of licensed consumer products or sales of our other consumer products and services 

the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create 

the value to us of our ip is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights or if existing laws are changed our ability to generate revenue from our ip may decrease or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase the terms of some copyrights for ip related to some of our products and services have expired and other copyrights will expire in the future for example in the united states and countries that look to the united states copyright term when shorter than their own the copyright term for early works such as the short film steamboat willie 1928 and the specific early versions of characters depicted in those works expires at the end of the 95th calendar year after the date the copyright was originally secured in the united states revenues generated from this intellectual property could be negatively impacted 

the unauthorized use of our ip may increase the cost of protecting rights in our ip or reduce our revenues the convergence of computing communication and entertainment devices increased broadband internet speed and penetration increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and enforcement of ip rights more challenging the unauthorized distribution and access to entertainment content generally continues to be a significant challenge for ip rights holders inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect entertainment industry ip in one country can adversely affect the results of the company’s operations worldwide despite the company’s efforts to protect its ip rights covid19 and distribution innovation in response to covid19 has increased opportunities to access content in unauthorized ways additionally negative economic conditions coupled with a shift in government priorities could lead to less enforcement these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our ip against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content and other commercial misuses of our ip 

with respect to ip developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright trademark and patent rights by third parties successful challenges to our rights in ip may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from or utilize the ip that is the subject of challenged rights from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain ip rights of third parties technological changes in industries in which the company operates and extensive patent coverage in those areas may increase the risk of such claims being brought and prevailing 

protection of electronically stored data and other cybersecurity is costly and if our data or systems are materially compromised in spite of this protection we may incur additional costs lost opportunities damage to our reputation disruption of service or theft of our assets 

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees in digital form we also use computer systems to deliver our products and services and operate our businesses data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of unauthorized access modification exfiltration destruction or denial of access and our computer systems are subject to cyberattacks that may result in disruptions in service we use many thirdparty systems and software which are also subject to supply chain and other 

cyberattacks we develop and maintain an information security program to identify and mitigate cyber risks but the development and maintenance of this program is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated accordingly despite our efforts the risk of unauthorized access modification exfiltration destruction or denial of access with respect to data or systems and other cybersecurity attacks cannot be eliminated entirely and the risks associated with a potentially material incident remain in addition we provide some confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties in certain cases which may also be compromised 

if our information or cyber security systems or data are compromised in a material way our ability to conduct our business may be impaired we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and as described above we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees may be damaged resulting in loss of business or morale and we may incur costs to remediate possible harm to our customers and employees or damages arising from litigation andor to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident insurance we obtain may not cover losses or damages associated with such attacks or events our systems and users and those of third parties with whom we engage are continually attacked sometimes successfully 

a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for or consumption of our products and services impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost or reduce the profitability of providing our products and services 

demand for and consumption of our products and services particularly our theme parks and resorts is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism the environment for travel and tourism as well as demand for and consumption of other entertainment products can be significantly adversely affected in the us globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including health concerns including as it has been by covid19 and could be by future health outbreaks and pandemics adverse weather conditions arising from shortterm weather patterns or longterm climate change catastrophic events or natural disasters such as excessive heat or rain hurricanes typhoons floods droughts tsunamis and earthquakes international political or military developments including social unrest a decline in economic activity and terrorist attacks these events and others such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to some of these events an incident that affected our property directly would have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could have an extended effect of discouraging consumers from attending our facilities moreover the costs of protecting against such incidents including the costs of protecting against the spread of covid19 reduces the profitability of our operations 

for example hurricanes including hurricane ian in late september 2022 which caused walt disney world resort parks in florida to close for two days have impacted the profitability of walt disney world resort and may do so in the future the company has paused certain operations in certain regions and the profitability of certain operations has been impacted as a result of events in the corresponding regions 

in addition we derive affiliate fees and royalties from the distribution of our programming sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected in specific geographic markets we have experienced delayed andor partial payments from certain affiliate partners due to liquidity issues 

we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events generally including certain physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles exclusions terms conditions and limits of liability the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss and we may experience material losses not covered by our insurance for example many losses related to impacts of covid19 have not been covered by insurance available to us 

changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses has increased and may continue to increase our costs and has otherwise affected and may continue to affect the profitability of our businesses or the value of our assets 

as changes in our business environment occur we have adjusted continue to adjust and may further adjust our business strategies to meet these changes and we may otherwise decide to further restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets for example in november 2022 we announced plans to reorganize dmed to advance our dtc strategies and rationalize costs in fiscal 2022 we announced plans to introduce an adsupported disney service new pricing model and price increases and cost realignment in march 2021 we announced the closure of a substantial number of our disneybranded 

retail stores and we have announced exploration of a number of new types of businesses in addition with the recent change in leadership there may be additional adjustments to our business strategies our new organization and strategies are among other things subject to execution risk and may not produce the anticipated benefits such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value for example notwithstanding our announced plans to rationalize costs the costs of our dtc strategy and associated losses may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated which may impact our distribution strategy across businessesdistribution platforms the types of content we distribute through various businessesdistribution platforms and the timing and sequencing of content windows our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies in addition external events including changing technology changing consumer purchasing patterns acceptance of content offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets when these changes or events occur we have incurred and may continue to incur costs to change our business strategy and have needed and may in the future need to writedown the value of assets for example current conditions including covid19 and our business decisions have reduced the value of some of our assets we have impaired goodwill and intangible assets at our international channels businesses and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets we may writedown other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the current business environment we also make investments in existing or new businesses including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines in recent years such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks expansion of our fleet of cruise ships the acquisition of tfcf and investments related to dtc offerings some of these investments have returns that are negative or low the ultimate business prospects of the businesses related to these investments are uncertain these investments may impact the profitability of our other businesses and these risks are exacerbated by covid19 in any of these events our costs may increase we may have significant charges associated with the writedown of assets or returns on new investments may be negative or lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring even if our strategies are effective in the long term our new offerings will generally not be profitable in the short term growth of our new offerings is unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not expand into new markets as or when anticipated our ability to forecast for new businesses may be impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses speed with which the competitive landscape changes volatility beyond our control such as the events beyond our control noted above and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based accordingly we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes 

increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities this includes among other types competition for human resources content and other resources we require in operating our business for example 

• our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative performing and business talent sports and other programming story properties advertiser support and market share with other studio operators television networks svod providers and other new sources of broadband delivered content 

• our television networks and stations and dtc offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with other television and svod services as well as with newspapers magazines billboards and radio stations in addition we increasingly face competition for advertising sales from internet and mobile delivered content which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means 

• our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers 

• our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreation activities 

• our content saleslicensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment 

• our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of ip 

• our dtc businesses compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors’ dtc offerings all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment as well as for technology creative performing and business talent and for content 

competition in each of these areas may further increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels increased competition may increase the cost of programming and other products and divert consumers from our creative or other products or to other products or other forms of entertainment which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs 

competition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services deprive us of talent necessary to produce high quality creative material or increase the cost of compensation for our employees such competition may also reduce or limit growth in prices for our products and services including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks and dtc offerings parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues 

our results may be adversely affected if longterm programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms 

we enter into longterm contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors as these contracts expire we must renew or renegotiate the contracts and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms we may lose programming rights or distribution rights as a result our portfolio of programming rights and the distributors of our programming have changed and may continue to change over time even if these contracts are renewed the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase or increase at faster rates than our historical experience and programming distributors facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges have demanded and may continue to demand terms including pricing and the breadth of distribution that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience moreover our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by a number of factors such as consolidation in the market for program distribution the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms and the impacts of covid19 with respect to the acquisition of programming rights particularly sports programming rights the impact of these longterm contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors including the strength of advertising markets subscription levels and rates for programming effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming 

changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses 

our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of us and overseas regulations some of these regulations include 

• us fcc regulation of our television and radio networks our national programming networks and our owned television stations see item 1 — business — disney media and entertainment distribution federal regulation 

• federal state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations 

• regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations including potential regulation regarding the sourcing importation and the sale of goods 

• environmental protection regulations 

• us and international anticorruption laws sanction programs and trade restrictions restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed ownership restrictions currency exchange controls or film or television content requirements investment obligations or quotas 

• domestic and international labor laws tax laws or currency controls 

new laws and regulations as well as changes in any of these current laws and regulations or regulator activities in any of these areas or others may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable and create an increasingly unpredictable regulatory landscape for example in 2019 india implemented regulation and tariffs impacting certain bundling of channels in 2022 the us and other countries implemented a series of sanctions against russia in response to events in russia and ukraine us agencies have enhanced trade restrictions and legislation is currently under consideration that would prohibit importation of goods from certain regions us state governments have become more active in passing legislation targeted at specific sectors and companies and in many countriesregions around the world including but not limited to the eu regulators are requiring us to broadcast on our linear or display on our dtc streaming services programming produced in specific countries as well as invest specified amounts of our revenues in local content productions 

public health and other regional national state and local regulations and policies are impacting our ability to operate our businesses at all or in accordance with historic practice in addition to the government requirements that have impacted most of our businesses as a result of covid19 government requirements may continue to be extended and new government requirements may be imposed to address covid19 or future health outbreaks or pandemics 

our operations outside the us may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions 

our operations in nonus jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than or in addition to us law our risks of operating internationally have increased following the completion of the tfcf acquisition which increased the importance of international operations to our future operations growth and prospects laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the us these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under us law moreover enforcement of laws in some international jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business in addition the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption which could reduce our ability to compete 

successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or us anticorruption laws applicable to our businesses as a result our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in nonus jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if us law alone governed these operations 

environmental social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses 

us and international regulators investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental social and governance esg matters for example new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to esg matters including human capital diversity sustainability climate change and cybersecurity are under consideration or being adopted which may include specific targetdriven disclosure requirements or obligations our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes all entailing additional compliance risk in addition we have announced a number of esg initiatives and goals which will require ongoing investment and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes consumers’ perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands in addition our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors for example our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on thirdparty collaboration mitigation innovations andor the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale 

damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our company across businesses and regions 

our reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses because our brands engage consumers across our businesses damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses because some of our brands are globally recognized brand damage may not be locally contained maintenance of the reputation of our company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate in addition we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands significant negative claims or publicity regarding the company or its operations products management employees practices business partners business decisions social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation even if such claims are untrue damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales business opportunities profitability recruiting and valuation of our securities 

various risks may impact the success of our dtc business 

we may not successfully execute on our dtc strategy the success of our dtc strategy and profitability of our dtc businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize dmed to advance our dtc strategies drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content manage churn in reaction to price increases achieve the desired financial impact of the disney ad supported service pricing model and price increases our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows the initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the dmed businessdistribution platform of initial exploitation and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows accordingly our distribution determinations impact the costs of each businessdistribution channel including dtc an increasing number of competitors have entered dtc businesses consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of dtc streaming services at increasing prices potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn in addition economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our dtc streaming services we face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent or may face increased costs to do so our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect we may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals government regulation including revised foreign content and ownership regulations may impact the implementation of our dtc business plans the highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our dtc offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates these and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our dtc businesses 

potential credit ratings actions increases in interest rates or volatility in the us and global financial markets could impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments 

our borrowing costs have been and can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based in part on the company’s performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios as a result of the financial impact of covid19 on our businesses standard and poor’s downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to bbb and downgraded our shortterm debt ratings by one notch to a2 fitch downgraded our long and shortterm credit ratings by one notch to a and f2 respectively as of october 1 2022 moody’s investors service’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a2 and p1 stable respectively standard and poor’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were bbb and a2 positive respectively and fitch’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a and f2 stable respectively these ratings actions have increased and any potential future 

downgrades could further increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on acceptable terms 

in addition increases in interest rates have increased our cost of borrowing and volatility in us and global financial markets could impact our access to or further increase the cost of financing past disruptions in the us and global credit and equity markets made it more difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments 

labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

a significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses including employees of our theme parks and writers directors actors and production personnel for our productions are covered by collective bargaining agreements in addition some of our employees outside the us are represented by works councils trade unions or other employee associations further the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products and employees of providers of programming content such as sports leagues may be covered by labor agreements with their employers in general a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues resolution of disputes or negotiation of rate increases may increase our costs 

the seasonality of certain of our businesses and timing of certain of our product offerings could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations 

each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations and variations in connection with the timing of our product offerings including as follows 

• revenues at dpep fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities and seasonal consumer purchasing behavior which generally results in increased revenues during the company’s first and fourth fiscal quarters peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods in addition licensing revenues fluctuate with the timing and performance of our theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts many of which have been delayed canceled or modified 

• revenues from television networks and stations are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels in general advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months 

• revenues from content saleslicensing fluctuate due to the timing of content releases across various distribution markets release dates and methods are determined by a number of factors including among others competition the timing of vacation and holiday periods and impacts of covid19 to various distribution markets 

• dtc revenues fluctuate based on changes in the number of subscribers and subscriber fee or revenue mix viewership levels on our digital platforms and the demand for sports and film and television content each of these may depend on the availability of content which varies from time to time throughout the year based on among other things sports seasons content production schedules and league shut downs because our dtc business is relatively new we have limited data on which to base our understanding of dtc seasonality 

accordingly negative impacts on our business occurring during a time of typical high seasonal demand such as our park closures due to covid19 restrictions or hurricane damage during the summer travel season or other high seasons could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year 

costs of employee health welfare and pension benefits including postretirement medical benefits for some employees and retirees may reduce our profitability 

with approximately 220000 employees our profitability is substantially affected by costs of our health welfare and pension benefits including the costs of medical benefits for current employees and the costs of postretirement medical benefits for some current employees and retirees we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors which are beyond our control including increases in the cost of health care impacts of covid19 or future health outbreaks and pandemics may lead to an increase in the cost of medical insurance and expenses in addition changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension and postretirement medical expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses 

acquisition risks 

our consolidated indebtedness increased substantially following completion of the tfcf acquisition and further increased as a result of the impacts of covid19 this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility 

as a result of the tfcf acquisition in fiscal 2019 the company’s net indebtedness increased substantially the increased indebtedness could have the effect of among other things reducing our financial flexibility and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions such as those presented by covid19 among others increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for investments capital expenditures share repurchases and dividends and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels our leverage ratios have increased as the result of covid19’s impact on financial performance which caused certain of the credit ratings agencies to downgrade their assessment of our credit ratings and are expected to remain elevated at least in the near term our debt ratings may be further downgraded which may negatively impact our cost of borrowings 

the tfcf acquisition and integration and hulu putcall may result in additional costs and expenses 

we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction and financing costs in connection with the tfcf acquisition and integration and the hulu putcall agreement with nbcu we may also incur accounting and other costs that were not anticipated at the time of the tfcf acquisition including costs for which we have established reserves or which may lead to reserves in the future such costs including the company’s obligations under the hulu putcall agreement with nbcu could negatively impact the company’s free cash flow and result in the company incurring additional indebtedness 

general risks 

the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 

the price of our common stock has experienced substantial volatility and may continue to be volatile various factors have impacted and may continue to impact the price of our common stock including among others changes in management variations in our operating results variations between our actual results and expectations of securities analysts changes in our estimates guidance or business plans changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts the activities operating results or stock price of our competitors or other industry participants in the industries in which we operate the announcement or completion of significant transactions by us or a competitor events affecting the stock market generally and the economic and political conditions in the us and internationally as well as other factors described in this item 1a some of these factors may adversely impact the price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance further volatility in the price of our common stock may negatively impact one or more of our businesses including by increasing cash compensation or stock awards for our employees who participate in our stock incentive programs or limiting our financing options for acquisitions and other business expansion

significant developments 

leadership change and pending restructuring 

as previously announced on november 20 2022 robert a iger returned to the company as chief executive officer “ceo” and a director mr iger previously spent more than four decades at the company including 15 years as ceo in announcing mr iger’s appointment the company noted he has agreed to serve as ceo for two years with a mandate from the company’s board of directors “to set the strategic direction for renewed growth and to work closely with the board in developing a successor to lead the company at the completion of his term” mr iger succeeded robert a chapek who had served as ceo since 2020 

as contemplated by the leadership change announcement we anticipate that within the coming months mr iger will initiate organizational and operating changes within the company to address the board’s goals while the plans are in early stages changes in our structure and operations including within dmed and including possibly our distribution approach and the businessesdistribution platforms selected for the initial distribution of content can be expected the restructuring and change in business strategy once determined could result in impairment charges 

covid19 pandemic 

since early 2020 the world has been and continues to be impacted by covid19 and its variants covid19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways most significantly at dpep where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended in addition at dmed we delayed or in some cases shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content operations have resumed at various points since may 2020 with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021 although operations resumed many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from covid19 such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses capacity restrictions and closures including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets and disruption of content production activities 

the impact of covid19 related disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of covid19 and its variants and among other things governmental actions imposed in response to covid19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees guests and talent

the company’s borrowing costs can also be impacted by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies which are based in significant part on the company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios as of october 1 2022 moody’s investors service’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a2 and p1 stable respectively standard and poor’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were bbb and a2 positive respectively and fitch’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a and f2 stable respectively the company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs on october 1 2022 the company met this covenant by a significant margin the company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities including the asia theme parks from any representations covenants or events of default

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of our significant accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

produced and acquiredlicensed content costs 

we amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues ultimate revenues 

with respect to produced films intended for theatrical release the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues is theatrical performance revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance the company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our dtc streaming services are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of ultimate revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms program ratings which are an indication of market acceptance directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons 

ultimate revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment conversely if our estimate of ultimate revenues increases cost amortization may be slowed 

produced content costs that are part of a group and acquiredlicensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straightline amortization pattern the determination of projected usage requires judgment and is reviewed on a regular basis for changes adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change for example beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 for certain content we are accelerating the rate of amortization in early periods slowing the rate in later periods and have adjusted the useful life based on historical and projected usage patterns the most sensitive factors affecting projected usage are historical and estimated viewing patterns if projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense 

for content that is predominantly monetized as a group the aggregate unamortized costs of the group are compared to the present value of the discounted cash flows using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content if the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group if there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group the unamortized cost of the individual title is writtenoff immediately licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of assessing recoverability 

the amortization of multiyear sports rights is based on projections of revenues for each season relative to projections of total revenues over the contract period estimated relative value projected revenues include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season if estimated relative values by year were to change significantly amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed 

revenue recognition 

the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for our revenue recognition policies 

pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions 

the company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense andor liability measurement which we evaluate annually other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increase 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense the guideline for setting this rate is a highquality longterm corporate bond rate we increased our discount rate to 544  at the end of fiscal 2022 from 288  at the end of fiscal 2021 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2022 yearend measurement date the company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of highquality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2023 by approximately  242 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at october 1 2022 by approximately 23 billion a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately  59 million and 20 billion respectively 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class our expected return on plan assets is 700  a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense a one percentage point change in the longterm asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2023 annual expense by approximately  172 million 

goodwill other intangible assets longlived assets and investments 

the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require on an interim basis the company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter 

goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment to test goodwill for impairment the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value if it is a quantitative assessment is required alternatively the company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test 

the qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit 

the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

in fiscal 2022 the company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment 

the impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill and the determination of fair value of the reporting units to determine the fair value of our reporting units we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flows corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy the company’s longterm cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual we believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions the impairment test results could differ and we could be required to record impairment charges 

to test its other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinitelived intangible assets exceeds its fair value if it is a quantitative assessment is required alternatively the company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test 

the qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows 

the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for the excess fair values of indefinitelived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values as appropriate 

the company tests longlived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering events indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable once a triggering event has occurred the impairment test employed is based on whether the company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group an asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group for assets held for sale to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell an impairment loss is recognized for the difference determining whether a longlived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions including whether a triggering event has occurred the identification of asset groups estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values 

the company has investments in equity securities for equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments if these forecasts are not met impairment charges may be recorded 

the company recorded noncash impairment charges of  02 billion and  03 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively the fiscal 2022 charges primarily related to our businesses in russia the fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our disneybranded retail stores in north america and europe 

allowance for credit losses 

we evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions in times of economic turmoil including covid19 our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low costs and expenses may increase in future periods and if it is too high costs and expenses may decrease in future periods see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

contingencies and litigation 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings these estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate from time to time we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure 

income tax 

as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in proposed assessments our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings or negotiations with taxing and legal authorities the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors including the company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments 

policies and procedures 

in the normal course of business we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments 

our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company’s portfolio of borrowings by policy the company targets fixedrate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges accordingly the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the us dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets liabilities commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable but not firmly committed transactions the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro japanese yen british pound chinese yuan and canadian dollar cross 

currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to us dollar denominated borrowings by policy the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures the economic or political conditions in certain countries have reduced and in the future could further reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in or repatriate cash from those countries 

our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities such as fuel oil and gasoline 

our objectives in managing exposures to marketbased fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities the amounts hedged using total return swap contracts are based on estimated liability balances 

it is the company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes 

value at risk var 

the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation the company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates currencies commodities and equity prices a variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at each fiscal quarter end the model includes all of the company’s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts commodities and market sensitive equity investments forecasted transactions firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the model 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

var on a combined basis increased to 395 million at october 1 2022 from 364 million at october 2 2021 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model is as follows unaudited in millions 



the var for hong kong disneyland resort and shanghai disney resort is immaterial as of october 1 2022 and has been excluded from the above table

the terms “company” “we” “our” and “us” are used in this report to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which businesses are conducted 

covid19 pandemic 

since early 2020 the world has been and continues to be impacted by the novel coronavirus covid19 and its variants covid19 and measures to prevent its spread has impacted our segments in a number of ways most significantly at the dpep segment where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended these operations resumed generally at reduced capacity at various points since may 2020 we have delayed or in some cases shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and stage play performances were suspended as of march 2020 stage play operations resumed generally at reduced capacity in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 theaters have been subject to capacity limitations and shifting government mandates or guidance regarding covid19 restrictions we experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content including the delay of key live sports programming during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 as well as the suspension of most film and television production in march 2020 although film and television production generally resumed beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we continue to see disruption of production activities depending on local circumstances fewer theatrical releases and production delays have limited the availability of film content to be sold in distribution windows subsequent to the theatrical release 

the impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will in turn depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of covid19 and its variants and among other things the impact of governmental actions imposed in response to covid19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees guests and talent

media and entertainment distribution strategy 

shifting consumer preferences for consumption of video content and in particular the increasingly widespread adoption of video streaming technology has significantly disrupted the traditional means and patterns of distribution for film and television content in general film content was traditionally distributed first in the theatrical market followed by the home entertainment market and then in the tvsvod market episodic television content was traditionally distributed at linear networks and then in the tvsvod market 

in response to these changes the company has significantly increased its focus on distribution of content via our own dtc streaming services relative to distribution along traditional patterns although the company continues to monetize a significant amount of its content in the traditional manner our focus on our own dtc distribution has had a number of impacts including but not limited to 

• in some cases we are producing exclusive content for our dtc streaming services 

• rather than selling our content in the tvsvod market we may choose to distribute it on our dtc streaming services 

• in part because of the impact of covid19 on theatrical markets around the world we may alter our traditional theatrical distribution approach for example by making a film available on our dtc streaming services at the same time it is in theaters and 

• we may choose to offer our content in payperview format on our own dtc streaming services eg premier access in addition to distributing it in traditional home entertainment markets 

over time all else being equal these impacts will tend to increase revenue at directtoconsumer and reduce revenue at linear networks and content saleslicensing 

a more detailed discussion of our distribution businesses and production groups follows

• regulation of programming  the fcc regulates broadcast programming by among other things banning “indecent” programming regulating political advertising and imposing commercial time limits during children’s programming penalties for broadcasting indecent programming can be over 400000 per indecent utterance or image per station

competition and seasonality 

the company’s theme parks and resorts as well as disney cruise line and disney vacation club compete with other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities the profitability of the leisuretime industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations health concerns the political environment travel industry trends amount of available leisure time oil and transportation prices weather patterns and natural disasters the licensing and retail business competes with other licensors retailers and publishers of character brand and celebrity names as well as other licensors publishers and developers of game software online video content websites other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as large and complex as the company a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the sec the most significant factors affecting our business include the following 

business economic market and operating condition risks 

the adverse impact of covid19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue 

since early 2020 the world has been and continues to be impacted by covid19 and its variants covid19 and measures to prevent its spread has impacted our segments in a number of ways most significantly at the dpep segment where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended most of our businesses have been closed suspended or restricted consistent with government mandates or guidance these operations resumed generally at reduced capacity at various points since may 2020 we experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content although film and television production generally resumed beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we continue to see disruption in production activities depending on local circumstances production delays and fewer theatrical releases have limited the availability of film content to be sold in distribution windows subsequent to the theatrical release theaters have been subject to capacity limitations and shifting government mandates or guidance regarding covid19 restrictions declines in linear viewership and consumption of our content due to production delays or otherwise result in decreased advertising revenue 

sports content continues to be delayed or impacted by covid19 restrictions continued or increased unavailability of sports content is likely to exacerbate the impacts to our business other of our offerings will be exposed to additional financial impacts in the event of future significant unavailability of content covid19 impacts could also hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our linear networks businesses we have experienced reduced numbers of reservations at our hotels and cruises we have experienced increased returns and refunds and customer requests for payment deferrals 

collectively our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue many of our businesses that are open are operating subject to restrictions and increased expenses these and other impacts of covid19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time covid19 impacts that have subsided may again impact our businesses in the future and new impacts may emerge from covid19 developments or other pandemics for example some of our parks closed due to government mandates or guidance following their initial reopening 

consumers may change their behavior and consumption patterns in response to the prolonged suspension of certain of our businesses such as subscription to pay television packages which experienced accelerated decline during some periods after the onset of covid19 or theatergoing to watch movies certain of our customers including individuals as well as businesses such as theatrical distributors affiliates licensees of rights to use our programming and ip advertisers and others have been negatively impacted by the economic downturn caused by covid19 which may continue to result in decreased purchases of our goods and services even after certain operations resume some industries in which our customers operate such as theatrical distribution retail and travel could experience contraction which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward additionally we have incurred and will continue to incur incremental costs to implement health and safety measures reopen our parks and restart our halted projects and operations as we have resumed production of content including live sports events we have incurred costs to implement health and safety measures and productions will generally take longer to complete 

our mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of covid19 on our businesses have had or may have negative impacts the company or our board of directors as applicable issued senior notes in march and may 2020 entered into an additional 50 billion credit facility in april 2020 which has now been terminated did not pay a dividend with respect to fiscal 2020 operations and has not declared nor paid a dividend with respect to fiscal 2021 operations suspended certain capital projects temporarily reduced certain discretionary expenditures such as spending on marketing temporarily reduced management compensation temporarily eliminated board of director retainers and committee fees furloughed over half of our employees and reduced our employee population such mitigation measures have resulted in the delay or suspension of certain projects in which we have invested particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations we may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing not declaring future dividends the company has announced an intention not to declare further dividends until a return to a more normalized operating environment reducing or not making certain payments such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans further suspending capital spending reducing film and television content investments or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy these and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses additionally there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of covid19 including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact covid19 may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing further the benefit of certain mitigation efforts will not continue to be available going forward for example as our employees are returning from furlough the cost reductions of the related furloughs are no longer available and we are incurring expenses to recall and hire employees 

even our operations that were not suspended or that have resumed continue to be adversely impacted by government mandated restrictions such as density limitations and travel restrictions and requirements measures we voluntarily implement measures we are contractually obligated to implement the distancing practices and health concerns of consumers talent and production workers and logistical limitations upon reopening our parks and resorts businesses we have seen certain instances of lower demand geographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses including our production operations our operations could be suspended resuspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to covid19 such as the current expansion of the delta variant or other variants for example both hong kong disneyland resort and disneyland paris have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of covid19 some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant covid19 outbreak impacting our employees customers or others interacting with our businesses including our supply chain 

in fiscal year 2020 we operated at a net loss and in fiscal year 2021 our net income from continuing operations remained substantially below prepandemic levels we have impaired goodwill and intangible assets at our international channels businesses and written down the value of certain of our retail store assets certain of our other assets could also become impaired including further impairments of goodwill and intangible assets we have increased and may further increase allowances for credit losses and there may be changes in judgments in determining the fairvalue of assets and estimates related to variable consideration may change due to increased returns reduced usage of our products or services and decreased royalties our leverage ratios have increased as a result of covid19’s impact on our financial performance which caused certain of the credit rating agencies to downgrade their assessment of our credit ratings and are expected to remain elevated at least in the near term our debt ratings may be further downgraded which may negatively impact our cost of borrowing due to reduced operating cash flow we may utilize cash balances andor future financings to fund a portion of our operations and investments in our businesses financial risks may be exacerbated by a number of factors including the timing of customer deposit refunds and liquidity issues among our key customers particularly advertisers television affiliates theatrical exhibitors 

and distributors and licensees these factors have impacted timely payments by such customers to the company additionally loss of or delay in the collection of receivables as a result of contractual performance short falls meeting our contractual payment obligations and investments we need to make in our business may result in increased financial risk the company has 125 billion in trade accounts receivable outstanding at october 2 2021 with an allowance for credit losses of 02 billion our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty due to the impacts of covid19 economic or political conditions in a country outside the us could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country 

the impacts of covid19 to our business have generally amplified or reduced our ability to mitigate the other risks discussed in our filings with the sec and our remediation efforts may not be successful 

covid19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses covid19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will in turn depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of covid19 and among other things the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to covid19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward where actual performance in our international markets significantly underperforms management’s forecasts the company has had and could have further foreign currency hedge gainslosses which are not offset by the realization of exposures resulting in excess hedge gains or losses while we cannot be certain as to the duration of the impacts of covid19 we expect impacts of covid19 to continue to affect our financial results in fiscal 2022 

changes in us global and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses 

a decline in economic activity such as recession or economic downturn in the us and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses thus reducing our revenue and earnings global economic activity has declined as a result of the impacts of covid19 past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts purchases of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations performance of our home entertainment releases and purchases of companybranded consumer products and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur the current decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming or directtoconsumer products economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us in addition an increase in price levels generally or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector such as current inflation related to domestic and global supply chain issues which has led to both overall price increases and pronounced price increases in certain sectors could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer which could also adversely affect our revenues and at the same time increase our costs a decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our expansion plans changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in nonus markets or reduce the us dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets economic or political conditions in a country could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country broader supply chain delays such as those currently impacting global distribution may impact our ability to sell and deliver goods or otherwise disrupt our operations 

changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products 

the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies new technologies affect the demand for our products the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams the sources and nature of competing content offerings the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences this trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution as evidenced by the industrywide decline in ratings for broadcast television the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels including for a number of our networks declines in linear viewership have resulted in decreased advertising revenue in order to respond to these developments we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models most recently by developing investing in and acquiring dtc products and reorganizing our media and entertainment businesses to accelerate our dtc strategies there can be no assurance that our dtc offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes we expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources particularly as we expand our dtc offerings there can be no assurance that the dtc model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be as profitable as our existing or historic business models 

misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment travel and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

our businesses create entertainment travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create content which may be distributed among other ways through broadcast cable internet or cellular technology theme park attractions hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content the success of our theme parks resorts cruise ships and experiences as well as our theatrical releases depends on demand for public or outofhome entertainment experiences covid19 may impact consumer tastes and preferences many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the us and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the us moreover we must often invest substantial amounts in content production and acquisition acquisition of sports rights theme park attractions cruise ships or hotels and other facilities or customer facing platforms before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance the impacts of covid19 are inhibiting and delaying our ability to earn returns on some of these and other investments if our entertainment offerings and products including our content offerings which have been impacted by covid19 as well as our methods to make our offerings and products available to consumers do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance our revenue may decline decline further or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby further adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses consumer tastes and preferences impact among other items revenue from advertising sales which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air affiliate fees subscription fees theatrical film receipts the license of rights to other distributors theme park admissions hotel room charges and merchandise food and beverage sales sales of licensed consumer products or sales of our other consumer products and services 

the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create 

the value to us of our ip is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights or if existing laws are changed our ability to generate revenue from our ip may decrease or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase 

the unauthorized use of our ip may increase the cost of protecting rights in our ip or reduce our revenues the convergence of computing communication and entertainment devices increased broadband internet speed and penetration increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and enforcement of ip rights more challenging the unauthorized distribution and access to entertainment content generally continues to be a significant challenge for ip rights holders inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect entertainment industry ip in one country can adversely affect the results of the company’s operations worldwide despite the company’s efforts to protect its ip rights covid19 and distribution innovation in response to covid19 has increased opportunities to access content in unauthorized ways additionally negative economic conditions coupled with a shift in government priorities could lead to less enforcement these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our ip against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content and other commercial misuses of our ip 

with respect to ip developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright trademark and patent rights by third parties successful challenges to our rights in ip may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from or utilize the ip that is the subject of challenged rights from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain ip rights of third parties technological changes in industries in which the company operates and extensive patent coverage in those areas may increase the risk of such claims being brought and prevailing 

protection of electronically stored data and other cybersecurity is costly and if our data or systems are materially compromised in spite of this protection we may incur additional costs lost opportunities damage to our reputation disruption of service or theft of our assets 

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees in digital form we also use computer systems to deliver our products and services and operate our businesses data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of unauthorized access modification exfiltration destruction or denial of access and our computer systems are subject to cyberattacks that may result in disruptions in service we use many third party systems and software which are also subject to supply chain and other 

cyberattacks we develop and maintain an information security program to identify and mitigate cyber risks but the development and maintenance of this program is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated accordingly despite our efforts the risk of unauthorized access modification exfiltration destruction or denial of access with respect to data or systems and other cybersecurity attacks cannot be eliminated entirely and the risks associated with a potentially material incident remain in addition we provide some confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties in certain cases when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where we believe appropriate monitor the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised 

if our information or cyber security systems or data are compromised in a material way our ability to conduct our business may be impaired we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and as described above we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees may be damaged resulting in loss of business or morale and we may incur costs to remediate possible harm to our customers and employees or damages arising from litigation andor to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident insurance we obtain may not cover losses or damages associated with such attacks or events our systems and the systems of third parties with whom we engage are continually attacked 

a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for or consumption of our products and services impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost or reduce the profitability of providing our products and services 

demand for and consumption of our products and services particularly our theme parks and resorts is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism the environment for travel and tourism as well as demand for and consumption of other entertainment products can be significantly adversely affected in the us globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including health concerns including as it has been by covid19 and could be by future pandemics adverse weather conditions arising from shortterm weather patterns or longterm climate change catastrophic events or natural disasters such as excessive heat or rain hurricanes typhoons floods tsunamis and earthquakes international political or military developments including social unrest a decline in economic activity and terrorist attacks these events and others such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to some of these events an incident that affected our property directly would have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could have an extended effect of discouraging consumers from attending our facilities moreover the costs of protecting against such incidents including the costs of protecting against the spread of covid19 reduces the profitability of our operations 

for example covid19 and measures to prevent the spread of covid19 are currently impairing our ability to provide our products and services and reducing consumption of those products and services further prior to covid19 events in hong kong impacted profitability of our hong kong operations and may continue to do so and past hurricanes have impacted the profitability of walt disney world resort in florida and future hurricanes may also do so 

the negative economic consequences of covid19 may be particularly challenging in markets where individuals and local businesses have limited access to government supported “safety nets” which could lead to political instability and unrest and further depress demand for our products and services over a longer timeframe 

in addition we derive affiliate fees and royalties from the distribution of our programming sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected in specific geographic markets we have experienced delayed andor partial payments from certain affiliate partners due to liquidity issues 

we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles exclusions terms conditions and limits of liability the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss and we may experience material losses not covered by our insurance for example most losses related to impacts of covid19 will not be covered by insurance available to us 

changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses or the value of our assets 

as changes in our business environment occur we have adjusted and may further adjust our business strategies to meet these changes and we may otherwise decide to further restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets for example in october 2020 we announced a reorganization of our media and entertainment businesses to accelerate our dtc strategies in march 2021 we announced the closure of a substantial number of our disneybranded retail stores and we have announced exploration of a number of new types of businesses our new organization and strategies may not produce the anticipated benefits such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies in addition external events including changing technology changing consumer purchasing patterns acceptance of our theatrical and other content offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets when these changes or events occur we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to writedown the value of assets for example current conditions including covid19 and our business decisions have reduced the value of some of our assets we have impaired goodwill and intangible assets at our international channels businesses and impaired the value of certain of our retail store assets we may writedown other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the current business environment we also make investments in existing or new businesses including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines in recent years such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks expansion of our fleet of cruise ships the acquisition of tfcf and investments related to dtc offerings some of these investments have returns that are negative or low the ultimate business prospects of the businesses related to these investments are uncertain these investments may impact the profitability of our other businesses and these risks are exacerbated by covid19 in any of these events our costs may increase we may have significant charges associated with the writedown of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring even if our strategies are effective in the long term growth of our new offerings is unlikely to be even quarter over quarter and we may not expand into new markets as or when anticipated our ability to forecast for new businesses may be impacted by our lack of experience operating in those new businesses volatility beyond our control such as the events beyond our control noted above and our ability to obtain or develop the content and rights on which our projections are based accordingly we may not achieve our forecasted outcomes 

increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities this includes among other types competition for human resources content and other resources we require in operating our business for example 

• our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative performing and business talent sports and other programming story properties advertiser support and market share with other studio operators television networks svod providers and other new sources of broadband delivered content 

• our television networks and stations and dtc offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with other television and svod services as well as with newspapers magazines billboards and radio stations in addition we increasingly face competition for advertising sales from internet and mobile delivered content which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means 

• our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers 

• our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreation activities 

• our content saleslicensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment 

• our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of ip 

• our dtc businesses compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors’ dtc offerings all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment as well as for technology creative performing and business talent and for content 

competition in each of these areas may increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels increased competition may divert consumers from our creative or other products or to other products or other forms of entertainment which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs 

competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services deprive us of talent necessary to produce high quality creative material or increase the cost of compensation for our employees such competition may also reduce or limit growth in prices for our products and services including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks parks and resorts admissions and room rates prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues and fees for our dtc offerings 

our results may be adversely affected if longterm programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms 

we enter into longterm contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors as these contracts expire we must renew or renegotiate the contracts and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms we may lose programming rights or distribution rights even if these contracts are renewed the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase or increase at faster rates than our historical experience or programming distributors facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges may demand terms including pricing and the breadth of distribution that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience moreover our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by consolidation in the market for program distribution the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms and the impacts of covid19 with respect to the acquisition of programming rights particularly sports programming rights the impact of these longterm contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors including the strength of advertising markets subscription levels and rates for programming effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming 

changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses 

our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of us and overseas regulations some of these regulations include 

• us fcc regulation of our television and radio networks our national programming networks and our owned television stations see item 1 — business — disney media and entertainment distribution federal regulation 

• federal state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations 

• regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations including potential regulation regarding the sourcing importation and the sale of goods 

• environmental protection regulations 

• imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed ownership restrictions currency exchange controls or film or television content requirements investment obligations or quotas 

• domestic and international labor laws tax laws or currency controls 

changes in any of these regulations or regulator activities in any of these areas or others may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable for example in january 2019 india implemented regulation and tariffs impacting certain bundling of channels us agencies have enhanced trade restrictions and legislation is currently under consideration that would prohibit importation of goods from certain regions and in many countriesregions around the world including but not limited to the eu regulators are requiring us to broadcast on our linear or display on our dtc streaming services programming produced in specific countries as well as invest specified amounts of our revenues in local content productions 

public health and other regional national state and local regulations and policies are impacting our ability to operate our businesses at all or in accordance with historic practice in addition to the government requirements that have closed or impacted most of our businesses as a result of covid19 government requirements may continue to be extended and new government requirements may be imposed 

our operations outside the us may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions 

our operations in nonus jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than us law laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the us these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under us law moreover enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business in addition the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or us anticorruption laws applicable to our businesses as a result our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in nonus jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if us law governed these operations 

damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our company across businesses and regions 

our reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses because our brands engage consumers across our businesses damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other 

businesses because some of our brands are globally recognized brand damage may not be locally contained maintenance of the reputation of our company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate significant negative claims or publicity regarding the company or its operations products management employees practices business partners business decisions social responsibility and culture may damage our brands or reputation even if such claims are untrue damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales business opportunities profitability recruiting and valuation of our securities 

risks that impact our business as a whole may also impact the success of our dtc business 

we may not successfully execute on our dtc strategy an increasing number of competitors have entered dtc businesses consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of dtc streaming services potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn we face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent government regulation including revised foreign content and ownership regulations may impact the implementation of our dtc business plans the highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our dtc offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers these and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our dtc businesses 

potential credit ratings actions increases in interest rates or volatility in the us and global financial markets could impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments 

our borrowing costs have been and can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based in part on the company’s performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios as a result of covid19 standard and poor’s downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to bbb and downgraded our shortterm debt ratings by one notch to a2 fitch downgraded our long and shortterm credit ratings by one notch to a and f2 respectively as of october 2 2021 moody’s investors service’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a2 and p1 stable respectively standard and poor’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were bbb and a2 stable respectively and fitch’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a and f2 stable respectively these ratings actions have increased and any potential future downgrades could further increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 

in addition increases in interest rates or volatility in us and global financial markets could impact our access to or increase the cost of financing past disruptions in the us and global credit and equity markets made it more difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments 

labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

a significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers directors actors production personnel and others employed at dmed in addition the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products and employees of providers of programming content such as sports leagues may be covered by labor agreements with their employers in general a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues resolution of disputes or negotiation of rate increases may increase our costs 

the seasonality of certain of our businesses and timing of certain of our product offerings could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations 

each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations and variations in connection with the timing of our product offerings including as follows 

• revenues in our dpep segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities and seasonal consumer purchasing behavior which generally results in increased revenues during the company’s first and fourth fiscal quarters peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods our parks resorts and experiences are or may be operating at diminished capacity or have been or may be closed during these periods as a result of covid19 in addition licensing revenues fluctuate with the timing and performance of our theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts many of which have been delayed canceled or modified 

• revenues from television networks and stations are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels in general advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months 

• revenues from content saleslicensing fluctuate due to the timing of content releases across various distribution markets release dates and methods are determined by a number of factors including among others competition the timing of vacation and holiday periods and impacts of covid19 to various distribution markets 

• dtc revenues fluctuate based on changes in the number of subscribers and subscriber fee or revenue mix viewership levels on our digital platforms and the demand for sports and film and television content each of these may depend on the availability of content which varies from time to time throughout the year based on among other things sports seasons content production schedules and league shut downs because our dtc business is relatively new we have limited data on which to base our understanding of dtc seasonality 

accordingly negative impacts on our business occurring during a time of typical high seasonal demand could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year examples include the ongoing impact of covid19 on various high seasons or hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season 

sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability 

with approximately 190000 employees our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension and current and postretirement medical benefits we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors which are beyond our control including increases in the cost of health care impacts of covid19 may lead to an increase in the cost of medical insurance and expenses in addition changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension and postretirement medical expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses 

the alteration or discontinuation of libor may adversely affect our borrowing costs 

certain of our interest rate derivatives and a portion of our indebtedness bear interest at variable interest rates primarily based on libor which may be subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences in july 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 however on november 30 2020 ice benchmark administration “iba” indicated that it would consult on its intention to cease publication of most usd libor tenors beyond june 30 2023 on march 5 2021 iba confirmed it would cease publication of overnight 1 3 6 and 12 month usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june 30 2023 iba also intends to cease publishing 1 week and 2 month usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31 2021 the alternative reference rates committee arcc which was convened by the federal reserve board and the new york fed has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the recommended riskfree alternative rate for usd libor the extended cessation date for most usd libor tenors will allow for more time for existing legacy usd libor contracts to mature and provide additional time to continue to prepare for the transition from libor at this time it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or the establishment of alternative reference rates such as sofr or any other reference rate will have on the company or its borrowing costs 

acquisition risks 

our consolidated indebtedness increased substantially following completion of the tfcf acquisition and further increased as a result of the impacts of covid19 this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility 

as a result of the tfcf acquisition in fiscal 2019 the company’s net indebtedness increased substantially the increased indebtedness could have the effect of among other things reducing our financial flexibility and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions such as those presented by covid19 among others increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for capital expenditures share repurchases and dividends and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels the company has announced an intention not to declare further dividends until a return to a more normalized operating environment our leverage ratios have increased as the result of covid19’s impact on financial performance which caused certain of the credit ratings agencies to downgrade their assessment of our credit ratings and are expected to remain elevated at least in the near term our debt ratings may be further downgraded which may negatively impact our cost of borrowings 

consummation of the tfcf acquisition has increased our exposure to the risks of operating internationally 

we are a diversified entertainment company that offers entertainment travel and consumer products worldwide although many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside of the us the combination with tfcf has increased the importance of international operations to our future operations growth and prospects 

our risks of operating internationally have increased following the completion of the tfcf acquisition and as a result of covid19 

the tfcf acquisition and integration and hulu putcall may result in additional costs and expenses 

we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction and financing costs in connection with the tfcf acquisition and integration and the hulu putcall agreement with nbcu we may also incur accounting and other costs that were not anticipated at the time of the tfcf acquisition including costs for which we have established reserves or which may lead to reserves in the future such costs could negatively impact the company’s free cash flow

significant developments 

covid19 pandemic 

since early 2020 the world has been and continues to be impacted by covid19 and its variants covid19 and measures to prevent its spread has impacted our segments in a number of ways most significantly at the dpep segment where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended these operations resumed generally at reduced capacity at various points since may 2020 we have delayed or in some cases shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and stage play performances were suspended as of march 2020 stage play operations resumed generally at reduced capacity in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 theaters have been subject to capacity limitations and shifting government mandates or guidance regarding covid19 restrictions we experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content including the delay of key live sports programming during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 as well as the suspension of most film and television production in march 2020 although film and television production generally resumed beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we continue to see disruption of production activities depending on local circumstances fewer theatrical releases and production delays have limited the availability of film content to be sold in distribution windows subsequent to the theatrical release 

we have taken a number of mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of covid19 on our businesses we significantly increased cash balances through the issuance of senior notes in march and may 2020 the company did not pay a dividend with respect to fiscal 2020 operations and has not declared or paid a dividend with respect to fiscal 2021 operations suspended certain capital projects reduced certain discretionary expenditures such as spending on marketing reduced management compensation for several months in fiscal 2020 and temporarily eliminated board of director retainers and committee fees in fiscal 2020 in addition we furloughed over 120000 of our employees who continued to receive company provided medical benefits most of which have returned from furlough as operations have reopened at the end of fiscal 2020 the company announced a workforce reduction plan which was essentially completed in the first half of fiscal 2021 we may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing not declaring future dividends reducing or not making certain payments such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans further suspending capital spending reducing film and television content investments or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategies some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our businesses 

the most significant impact on operating income since the second quarter of fiscal 2020 from covid19 was at the dpep segment due to revenue lost as a result of closures andor reduced operating capacities although results improved in the second half of fiscal 2021 compared to the second half of fiscal 2020 from reopening our dpep businesses we continue to be impacted by reduced operating capacities covid19 also had a negative impact in fiscal 2021 at our dmed segment compared to fiscal 2020 as higher advertising revenue from the return of live sporting events was more than offset by higher sports programming costs our other film and television distribution businesses were impacted by revenue lost from the deferral or cancellation of significant film releases partially offset by costs avoided due to a reduction in film cost amortization marketing and distribution costs the impact of covid19 on fiscal 2021 and 2020 results is not necessarily indicative of the impact on future period results 

the impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will in turn depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of covid19 and its variants and among other things the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to covid19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward 

our businesses have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees guests and talent for example when we reopened theme parks and retail stores we incurred and will continue to incur costs for such things as additional custodial services personal protection equipment temperature screenings and testing sanitizer and cleaning supplies and signage among other items similar costs have been incurred in the production of film and television content including live sporting events and productions may take longer to complete the timing duration and extent of these costs will depend on the timing and scope of the resumption of our operations these costs totaled approximately 1 billion in fiscal 2021 some of these costs have been capitalized and will be amortized over future periods with the unknown duration of covid19 it is not possible to precisely estimate the impact of covid19 on our operations in future periods although we estimate a modestly lower impact in fiscal 2022 in addition we are no longer benefiting from certain savings related to the closure of certain businesses such as related furloughs the reopening or closure of our businesses is dependent on applicable government requirements which vary by location and are subject to ongoing changes 

additionally see part i item 1a risk factors  the adverse impact of covid19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue 

directtoconsumer 

the company has significantly increased its focus on distribution of branded film and episodic content via our own dtc streaming services as a result we are forgoing certain licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties in tvsvod markets we also expect to forgo revenue as we shut down channels in certain markets as a result of investment in our dtc offerings in addition we are increasing programming and production investments to create exclusive content for our dtc offerings 

consolidated results and nonsegment items 

the company’s fiscal year end is on the saturday closest to september 30 and consists of fiftytwo weeks with the exception that approximately every six years we have a fiftythree week year fiscal 2020 was a fiftythree week year which began on september 29 2019 and ended on october 3 2020 we estimate that the additional week of operations in fiscal 2020 resulted in a benefit to pretax income in the prior year of approximately 200 million primarily at the dmed segment 

revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 3 or 20 billion to 674 billion net income attributable to disney increased 49 billion to income of 20 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to disney increased to income of 111 compared to a loss of 157 in the prior year the eps increase for the year was due to the comparison to goodwill and intangible asset impairments recognized in the prior year at our international channels business an income tax benefit in the current year compared to tax expense in the prior year and lower amortization of fair value stepup on film and television costs and intangible assets from the tfcf acquisition and consolidation of hulu collectively tfcf and hulu acquisition amortization these increases were partially offset by lower net investment gains and a decrease in segment operating income at dmed 

revenues 

service revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 4 or 25 billion to 618 billion due to higher dtc subscription revenue advertising revenue growth and to a lesser extent increased merchandise licensing revenue these increases were partially offset by a decrease in tvsvod distribution revenue lower theatrical revenues a decrease in revenue at our parks and experiences businesses and to a lesser extent lower electronic home entertainment sales all of which reflected the impact of covid19 the decrease at parks and experiences was due to lower volumes from closuregenerally reduced operating capacities partially offset by an increase in average guest spending the decrease in tvsvod distribution revenue also reflected the shift from licensing our content to third parties to distributing it on our dtc streaming services 

product revenues for fiscal 2021 decreased 8 or 05 billion to 57 billion due to lower home entertainment volumes and a decrease in merchandise food and beverage sales at parks and experiences as lower volumes were partially offset by an increase in average guest spending 

costs and expenses 

cost of services for fiscal 2021 increased 4 or 17 billion to 411 billion due to higher programming production and technology costs at disney and hulu and higher sports programming costs the increase in sports programming costs was due to nba cricket college football and soccer events many of which shifted from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 due to covid19 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in film and television production cost amortization and distribution costs at 

content saleslicensing reflecting lower revenues and to a lesser extent lower volumes at our parks and experiences businesses 

cost of products for fiscal 2021 decreased 11 or 05 billion to 40 billion due to lower merchandise food and beverage sales at our theme parks and resorts and a decrease in home entertainment volumes 

selling general administrative and other costs for fiscal 2021 increased 9 or 11 billion to 135 billion due to higher marketing costs at directtoconsumer and linear networks partially offset by lower marketing costs at content saleslicensing 

depreciation and amortization costs decreased 4 or 02 billion to 51 billion due to lower amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of tfcf and hulu and lower depreciation at our theme parks and resorts 

restructuring and impairment charges 

restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2021 were 07 billion due to 04 billion of asset impairments and severance costs related to the shutdown of an animation studio and the closure of a substantial number of disneybranded retail stores in north america and europe and 03 billion of severance and other costs in connection with the integration of tfcf and workforce reductions at dpep

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of our significant accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

produced and acquiredlicensed content costs 

we amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues ultimate revenues 

with respect to produced films intended for theatrical release the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues is theatrical performance revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance the company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our dtc streaming services are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of ultimate revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms program ratings which are an indication of market acceptance directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons 

ultimate revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment conversely if our estimate of ultimate revenues increases cost amortization may be slowed 

produced content costs that are part of a group and acquiredlicensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straightline amortization pattern the determination of projected usage requires judgement and is reviewed periodically for changes if projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense 

the amortization of multiyear sports rights is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue relative value if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season if estimated relative values by year were to change significantly amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed 

revenue recognition 

the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for our revenue recognition policies 

pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions 

the company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense andor liability measurement which we evaluate annually other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increase 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense the guideline for setting this rate is a highquality longterm corporate bond rate we increased our discount rate to 288  at the end of fiscal 2021 from 282  at the end of fiscal 2020 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2021 yearend measurement date the company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of highquality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2022 by approximately  341 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at october 2 2021 by approximately 40 billion a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately  292 million and 34 billion respectively 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class our expected return on plan assets is 700  a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense a one percentage point change in the longterm asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2022 annual expense by approximately  175 million 

goodwill other intangible assets longlived assets and investments 

the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require on an interim basis the company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter 

goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment to test goodwill for impairment the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value if it is a quantitative assessment is required alternatively the company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test 

the qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit 

the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

in fiscal 2021 the company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment 

the impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill and the determination of fair value of the reporting units to determine the fair value of our reporting units we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flows corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy the company’s longterm cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual we believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions the impairment test results could differ and we could be required to record impairment charges 

to test its other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinitelived intangible assets exceeds its fair value if it is a quantitative assessment is required alternatively the company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test 

the qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows 

the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for the excess fair values of indefinitelived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values as appropriate 

the company tests longlived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering events indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable once a triggering event has occurred the impairment test employed is based on whether the company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group an asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group for assets held for sale to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell an impairment loss is recognized for the difference determining whether a longlived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions including whether a triggering event has occurred the identification of asset groups estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values 

the company has investments in equity securities for equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments if these forecasts are not met impairment charges may be recorded 

the company recorded noncash impairment charges of 03 billion and 52 billion in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our disneybranded retail stores in north america and europe 

the fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of mvpd agreement intangible assets 19 billion and goodwill 31 billion at the international channels’ business see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these impairment charges 

allowance for credit losses 

we evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions in times of economic turmoil including covid19 our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low costs and expenses may increase in future periods and if it is too high costs and expenses may decrease in future periods see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

contingencies and litigation 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings these estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate from time to time we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure 

income tax 

as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in proposed assessments our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings or negotiations with taxing and legal authorities the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors including the company’s decision to 

settle rather than litigate a matter relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities 

impacts of covid19 on accounting policies and estimates 

in light of the currently unknown ultimate duration and severity of covid19 we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply our significant accounting policies and make changes to these estimates and judgements over time this could result in meaningful impacts to our financial statements in future periods a more detailed discussion of the impact of covid19 on the accounting policies and estimates follows 

produced and acquiredlicensed content costs 

certain of our completed or in progress film and television productions have had their initial release dates delayed the duration of the delay market conditions when we release the content or a change in our release strategy eg bypassing certain distribution windows could have an impact on ultimate revenues which may accelerate amortization or result in an impairment of capitalized film and television production costs 

given the ongoing uncertainty around live sporting events continuing uninterrupted the amount and timing of revenues derived from the broadcast of these events may differ from the projections of revenues that support our amortization pattern of the rights costs we pay for these events such changes in revenues could result in an acceleration or slowing of the amortization of our sports rights costs 

revenue recognition 

certain of our affiliate contracts contain commitments with respect to the content to be aired on our television networks eg live sports or original content if there are delays or cancellations of live sporting events or disruptions to film and television content production activities we may need to assess the impact on our contractual obligations and adjust the revenue that we recognize related to these contracts 

goodwill other intangible assets longlived assets and investments 

given the ongoing impacts of covid19 across our businesses the projected cash flows that we use to assess the fair value of our businesses and assets for purposes of impairment testing are subject to greater uncertainty than normal if in the future we reduce our estimate of cash flow projections we may need to impair some of these assets 

prior to the company’s reorganization in october 2020 the former directtoconsumer  international segment included an international channels reporting unit which was comprised of the company’s international television networks our international television networks primarily derive revenues from affiliate fees charged to mvpds for the right to deliver our programming under multiyear licensing agreements and the sales of advertising timespace on the networks 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we assessed the international channels’ longlived assets and goodwill for impairment and recorded impairments of  19 billion primarily related to mvpd agreement intangible assets and 31 billion related to goodwill 

as of october 2 2021 the remaining balance of our international mvpd agreement intangible assets was 22 billion primarily related to our channel businesses in latin america and india 

see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impairment tests performed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 

risk management contracts 

the company employs a variety of financial instruments derivatives including interest rate and crosscurrency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

as a result of the impact of covid19 on our businesses our projected cash flows or projected usage of commodities are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty which may cause us to recognize gains or losses on our hedging instruments in different periods than the hedged transaction 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements 

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for “forwardlooking statements” made by or on behalf of the company we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forwardlooking” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to our 

shareholders such statements may for example express expectations projections estimates plans or future impacts actions that we may take or not take developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions or other statements that are not historical in nature all forwardlooking statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance as of the time the statements are made and the company does not undertake any obligation to update its disclosure relating to forwardlooking matters actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied due to a variety of important factors many of which are beyond our control in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the sec the most significant factors affecting these expectations which may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports we file with the sec are set forth under item 1a – risk factors of this report on form 10k as well as in this item 7  management’s discussion and analysis and item 1  business 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments 

policies and procedures 

in the normal course of business we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments 

our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company’s portfolio of borrowings by policy the company targets fixedrate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges accordingly the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the us dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets liabilities commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable but not firmly committed transactions the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro japanese yen british pound chinese yuan and canadian dollar crosscurrency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to us dollar denominated borrowings by policy the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures the economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country 

our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities such as fuel oil and gasoline 

it is the company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes 

value at risk var 

the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation the company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates currencies commodities and equity prices a variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at each fiscal quarter end the model includes all of the company’s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts commodities and market sensitive equity investments forecasted transactions firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the model 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

var on a combined basis increased to 364 million at october 2 2021 from 323 million at october 3 2020 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model is as follows unaudited in millions 



the var for hong kong disneyland resort and shanghai disney resort is immaterial as of october 2 2021 and accordingly has been excluded from the above table

covid19 pandemic 

during fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021 the world has been and continues to be impacted by the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic covid19 and measures to prevent its spread impacted our segments in a number of ways most significantly at parks experiences and products where our theme parks were closed or operating at significantly reduced capacity for a significant portion of the year cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended since late in the second quarter and retail stores were closed for a significant portion of the year we also had an adverse impact on our merchandise licensing business our studio entertainment segment has delayed or in some cases shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and stage play performances have been suspended since late in the second quarter we also had adverse impacts on advertising sales at media networks and directtoconsumer  international since march 2020 we have experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content including the shift of key live sports programming from our third quarter to the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021 as well as the suspension of production of most film and television content since late in the second quarter although some film and television production resumed in the fourth quarter 

the impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will in turn depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of covid19 and among other things the impact of governmental actions imposed in response to covid19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward as some of our businesses have reopened we have incurred additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees talent and guests the reopening or closure of our businesses is dependent on applicable government requirements which vary by location are subject to ongoing changes which could result from increasing covid19 cases

competition and seasonality 

the company’s dtc and international channel businesses compete for viewers primarily with other television and cable networks television stations and other media such as dtc services and video games with respect to the sale of advertising time we compete with other television networks television stations mvpds and other advertising media such as digital content newspapers magazines and billboards 

the company’s international channels face competition from other networks for carriage by mvpds the company’s contractual agreements with mvpds are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business consolidation and other market conditions in the cable satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the company’s ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for distribution that are as favorable as those currently in place 

the company’s dtc and international channels businesses also compete with other media and entertainment companies svod providers and dtc services for the acquisition of sports rights talent show concepts and scripted and other programming 

internet websites and digital products operated by the segment compete with other websites and entertainment products 

revenues fluctuate based on the timing of releases and performance of our digital media content viewership levels on our channels and digital platforms changes in subscriber levels and the demand for sports and other content 

intercompany eliminations 

intersegment content transactions are presented “gross” ie the segment producing the content reports revenue and profit from intersegment transactions and the required eliminations are reported on a separate “eliminations” line when presenting a summary of our segment results 

as it relates to film and television content that is produced by our media networks and studio entertainment segments that will be used on our dtc services there are four broad categories of content 

• content produced for exclusive dtc use “originals” 

• new studio entertainment theatrical releases following the theatrical and home entertainment windows “studio pay 1” 

tabl e of contents 

• new media networks episodic television series following their initial airing on our linear networks “media pay 1” and 

• content in all other windows “library” 

the intersegment transfer price for purposes of segment financial reporting pursuant to asc 280 segment reporting is generally cost plus a margin for originals and media pay 1 content and generally based on comparable transactions for studio pay 1 and library content imputed title by title intersegment license fees that may be necessary for other purposes are established as required by those purposes 

intersegment revenue is recognized upon availability of the content to the dtc service except with respect to library content for which revenue is recognized ratably over the license period 

our dtc services generally amortize intersegment content costs for originals and studio pay 1 content on an accelerated basis and for media pay 1 and library content on a straight line basis 

when the dtc amortization timing is different than the timing of revenue recognition at studio entertainment or media networks the difference results in an operating income impact in the elimination segment which nets to zero over the dtc amortization period generally timing of revenue recognition is similar to the reporting of thirdparty sales transactions except that intersegment sales of library content are generally recognized over time

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as large and complex as the company a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the sec the most significant factors affecting our business include the following 

business economic market and operating condition risks 

the adverse impact of covid19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue 

the impact of covid19 and measures to prevent its spread are affecting our businesses in a number of ways our theme parks were closed or operating at significantly reduced capacity for a significant portion of the year cruise ship sailings guided tours and stage play performances were suspended since late in the second quarter and retail stores were closed for a significant portion of the year in addition we have delayed or in some instances shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and have experienced adverse impacts on advertising sales and on our merchandise licensing business many of our businesses have been closed or suspended consistent with government mandates or guidance we have experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content including the deferral or cancellation of certain sports events and suspension of production of most film and television content we have continued to pay for certain sports rights including for certain events that have been deferred or canceled the impacts to our content have resulted in decreased viewership and advertising revenues and demands for affiliate fee reductions related to certain of our television networks these impacts are likely to be exacerbated the longer such content is not available including if sports content should become unavailable again in the future other of our offerings will be exposed to additional financial impacts in the event of future significant unavailability of content covid19 impacts could also hasten the erosion of our historical sources of revenue at our media networks businesses we have significantly reduced numbers of reservations at our hotels and cruises we have granted rent waivers to some of our tenants and they have not paid rent while certain of our facilities have been closed we have experienced increased returns and refunds and customer requests 

tabl e of contents 

for payment deferrals collectively our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue some of our businesses remain closed and those that are open are operating subject to restrictions and increased expenses these and other impacts of covid19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time covid19 impacts that have subsided may again impact our businesses in the future and new impacts may emerge particularly given the rise of covid19 cases following the end of fiscal 2020 for example some of our parks have closed due to government mandates or guidance following their initial reopening 

consumers may change their behavior and consumption patterns in response to the prolonged suspension of certain of our businesses such as subscription to pay television packages which have experienced accelerated decline during covid19 or theatergoing to watch movies certain of our customers including individuals as well as businesses such as theatrical distributors affiliates licensees of rights to use our programming and intellectual property advertisers and others have been negatively impacted by the economic downturn caused by covid19 which may result in decreased purchases of our goods and services even after certain operations resume some industries in which our customers operate such as theatrical distribution retail and travel could experience contraction which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward additionally we have and will continue to incur incremental costs to implement health and safety measures reopen our parks and restart our halted construction projects as we have resumed production of film and television content including live sporting events we have incurred costs to implement health and safety measures and productions will generally take longer to complete 

our mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of covid19 on our businesses have had or may have negative impacts the company or our board of directors as applicable significantly increased cash balances through the issuance of senior notes in march and may 2020 and we entered into an additional 50 billion credit facility in april 2020 did not declare a dividend with respect to fiscal year 2020 operations suspended certain capital projects reduced certain discretionary expenditures such as spending on marketing temporarily reduced management compensation temporarily eliminated board of director retainers and committee fees furloughed over half of our employees some of whom remain furloughed and continue to receive company provided medical benefits and reduced our employee population such mitigation measures have resulted in the delay or suspension of certain projects in which we have invested particularly at our parks and resorts and studio entertainment segment we may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing not declaring future dividends reducing or not making certain payments such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans further suspending capital spending reducing film and television content investments or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force these and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses additionally there are certain limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of covid19 including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact covid19 may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing further the benefit of certain mitigation efforts will not continue to be available going forward for example as our employees return from furlough the cost reductions of the related furloughs will no longer be available 

even our operations that were not suspended or that have resumed continue to be adversely impacted by government mandated restrictions such as density limitations and travel restrictions measures we voluntarily implement measures we are contractually obligated to implement the distancing practices and health concerns of consumers talent and production workers and logistical limitations upon reopening our parks and resorts business we have seen lower demand geographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses including our production operations our operations could be suspended or resuspended by government action or otherwise in the future for example after hong kong disneyland resort reopened in june 2020 it closed again in july 2020 and disneyland paris opened july 2020 and closed again in october 2020 some of our businesses have not yet been permitted to open such as disneyland resort and our cruise business some of our employees who returned to work have been refurloughed our operations could be negatively impacted by a significant covid19 outbreak impacting our employees customers or others interacting with our businesses including our supply chain 

in fiscal year 2020 we operated at a net loss we have impaired goodwill and intangible assets at our international channels businesses and written down the value of certain of our retail store assets certain of our other assets could also become impaired including further impairments of goodwill and intangible assets we have increased and may further increase allowances for credit losses and there may be changes in judgments in determining the fairvalue of assets and estimates related to variable consideration may change due to increased returns reduced usage of our products or services and decreased royalties our leverage ratios have increased and may remain elevated in the nearterm as a result of covid19’s impact on our financial performance causing certain of the credit rating agencies to downgrade our ratings our debt ratings may be further downgraded as a result of the covid19 impact which may negatively impact our cost of borrowing due to reduced operating cash flow we may utilize cash balances andor future financings to fund a portion of our operations and investments in our businesses financial risks may be exacerbated by the timing of customer deposit refunds liquidity issues among our key customers particularly advertisers television affiliates theatrical exhibitors and distributors and licensees which have impacted timely payments by such customers to the company loss or delay of receivables as a result of contractual performance short falls and our contractual payment obligations the company has 131 billion in trade accounts receivable 

tabl e of contents 

outstanding at october 3 2020 with an allowance for credit losses of 05 billion our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty due to the impacts of covid19 economic or political conditions in a country outside the us as a result of covid19 could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country 

the impacts of covid19 to our business have generally amplified or reduced our ability to mitigate the other risks discussed herein our remediation efforts may not be successful 

covid19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses covid19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will in turn depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of covid19 and among other things the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to covid19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward if actual performance in our international markets significantly underperforms management’s forecasts the company could have foreign currency hedge gainslosses which are not offset by the realization of exposures resulting in excess hedge gains or losses while we cannot be certain as to the duration of the impacts of covid19 we expect impacts of covid19 to affect our financial results at least through fiscal 2021 

changes in us global and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses 

a decline in economic activity in the us and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses thus reducing our revenue and earnings global economic activity has declined as a result of covid19 past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts purchases of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations performance of our home entertainment releases and purchases of companybranded consumer products and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur the current decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming or directtoconsumer products economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us in addition an increase in price levels generally or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer which could also adversely affect our revenues and at the same time increase our costs a decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our expansion plans changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in nonus markets or reduce the us dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets economic or political conditions in a country could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country 

changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products 

the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies new technologies affect the demand for our products the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams the sources and nature of competing content offerings the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences this trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution as evidenced by the industrywide decline in ratings for broadcast television the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels including for a number of our networks covid19 has accelerated this trend in order to respond to these developments we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models most recently by developing investing in and acquiring dtc products and reorganizing our media and entertainment businesses to accelerate our dtc strategies there can be no assurance that our dtc offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes we expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources particularly as we expand our dtc offerings there can be no assurance that the dtc model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be as profitable as our existing or historic business models 

misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

our businesses create entertainment travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create filmed entertainment and television programming which may be distributed among other ways through 

tabl e of contents 

broadcast cable internet or cellular technology theme park attractions hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content the success of our theme parks resorts cruise ships and experiences as well as our theatrical releases depends on demand for public or outofhome entertainment experiences covid19 may impact consumer tastes and preferences many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the us and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the us moreover we must often invest substantial amounts in film production television programming other content production and acquisition acquisition of sports rights theme park attractions cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance the impacts of covid19 are inhibiting and delaying our ability to earn returns on these and other investments if our entertainment offerings and products including our content offerings modified as a result of covid19 do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance our revenue from advertising sales which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air affiliate fees subscription fees theatrical film receipts the license of rights to other distributors theme park admissions hotel room charges and merchandise food and beverage sales sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline decline further or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby further adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses 

the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create 

the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights or if existing laws are changed our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase 

the unauthorized use of our intellectual property may increase the cost of protecting rights in our intellectual property or reduce our revenues the convergence of computing communication and entertainment devices increased broadband internet speed and penetration increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging the unauthorized distribution and access to entertainment content generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect entertainment industry intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the company’s operations worldwide despite the company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights covid19 may increase incentives and opportunities to access content in unauthorized ways as negative economic conditions coupled with a shift in government priorities could lead to less enforcement these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content 

with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright trademark and patent rights by third parties successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights 

protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection we may incur additional costs lost opportunities and damage to our reputation 

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees in digital form data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of unauthorized access modification and exfiltration we develop and maintain information security systems in an effort to prevent this but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated accordingly despite our efforts unauthorized access modification and exfiltration of data cannot be eliminated entirely and the risks associated with a potentially material incident remain in addition we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where we believe appropriate monitor the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised if our information security systems or data are compromised in a material way our ability to conduct our business may be impaired we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and as described above we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees may be damaged resulting in loss of business or morale and we may incur costs to remediate

possible harm to our customers and employees andor to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident 

a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for or consumption of our products and services impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost or reduce the profitability of providing our products and services 

demand for and consumption of our products and services particularly our theme parks and resorts is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism the environment for travel and tourism as well as demand for and consumption of other entertainment products can be significantly adversely affected in the us globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including adverse weather conditions arising from shortterm weather patterns or longterm change catastrophic events or natural disasters such as excessive heat or rain hurricanes typhoons floods tsunamis and earthquakes health concerns including as it has been by covid19 international political or military developments and terrorist attacks these events and others such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to some of these events an incident that affected our property directly would have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could have an extended effect of discouraging consumers from attending our facilities moreover the costs of protecting against such incidents including the costs of protecting against the spread of covid19 reduces the profitability of our operations 

for example covid19 and measures to prevent the spread of covid19 are currently impairing our ability to provide our products and services and reducing consumption of those products and services further prior to covid19 events in hong kong impacted profitability of our hong kong operations and may continue to do so and past hurricanes have impacted the profitability of walt disney world resort in florida and future hurricanes may also do so 

the negative economic consequences of covid19 may be particularly challenging in markets where individuals and local businesses have limited access to government supported “safety nets” which could lead to political instability and unrest and further depress demand for our products and services over a longer timeframe 

in addition we derive affiliate fees and royalties from the distribution of our programming sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected impacts of covid19 on third parties’ liquidity have impacted timely payments by such third parties to the company 

we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles exclusions terms conditions and limits of liability the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss and we may experience material losses not covered by our insurance for example we expect some losses related to impacts of covid19 will not be covered by insurance available to us and insurers may contest coverage 

changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses or the value of our assets 

as changes in our business environment occur we have adjusted and may further adjust our business strategies to meet these changes and we may otherwise decide to further restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets for example in october 2020 we announced a reorganization of our media and entertainment businesses to accelerate our directtoconsumer strategies our new organization and strategies may not produce the anticipated benefits such as supporting our growth strategies and enhancing shareholder value our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies in addition external events including changing technology changing consumer patterns acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets when these changes or events occur we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to writedown the value of assets for example current conditions including covid19 and our business decisions have reduced the value of some of our assets we have impaired goodwill and intangible assets at our international channels businesses and written down the value of certain of our retail store assets we may writedown other assets as our strategy evolves to account for the current business environment we also make investments in existing or new businesses including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines in recent years such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks expansion of our fleet of cruise ships the acquisition of tfcf and investments related to directtoconsumer offerings some of these investments may have returns that are negative or low the ultimate business prospects of the businesses related to these investments may be uncertain these investments may impact the profitability of our other 

tabl e of contents 

businesses and these risks are exacerbated by covid19 in any of these events our costs may increase we may have significant charges associated with the writedown of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring 

increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities this includes among other types competition for human resources programming and other resources we require in operating our business for example 

• our studio operations and media businesses compete to obtain creative performing and business talent sports and other programming story properties advertiser support and market share with other studio operations broadcast and cable networks svod providers and other new sources of broadband delivered content 

• our broadcast and cable networks and stations and directtoconsumer offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast cable and satellite services as well as with newspapers magazines billboards and radio stations in addition we increasingly face competition for advertising sales from internet and mobile delivered content which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means 

• our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers 

• our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreation activities 

• our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment 

• our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of intellectual property 

• our directtoconsumer businesses compete for customers with competitors’ directtoconsumer offerings all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment as well as for technology creative performing and business talent and for content competition in each of these areas may increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels increased competition may divert consumers from our creative or other products or to other products or other forms of entertainment which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs 

competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services or deprive us of talent necessary to produce high quality creative material such competition may also reduce or limit growth in prices for our products and services including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues 

our results may be adversely affected if longterm programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms 

we enter into longterm contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors as these contracts expire we must renew or renegotiate the contracts and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms we may lose programming rights or distribution rights even if these contracts are renewed the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase or increase at faster rates than our historical experience or programming distributors facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges may demand terms including pricing and the breadth of distribution that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience moreover our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by consolidation in the market for program distribution the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms and the impacts of covid19 with respect to the acquisition of programming rights particularly sports programming rights the impact of these longterm contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors including the strength of advertising markets subscription levels and rates for programming effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming 

changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses 

our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of us and overseas regulations these regulations include 

• us fcc regulation of our television and radio networks our national programming networks and our owned television stations see item 1 — business — media networks federal regulation 

• federal state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations 

tabl e of contents 

• regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations including potential regulation regarding the sourcing importation and sale of goods 

• environmental protection regulations 

• imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed ownership restrictions currency exchange controls or film or television content requirements investment obligations or quotas 

• domestic and international labor laws tax laws or currency controls 

changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable for example in january 2019 india implemented regulation and tariffs impacting certain bundling of channels and in november 2020 potential us legislation is pending prohibiting importation of goods from certain regions 

public health and other regional national state and local regulations and policies are impacting our ability to operate our businesses at all or in accordance with historic practice in addition to the government requirements that have closed or impacted most of our businesses as a result of covid19 government requirements may continue to be extended and new government requirements may be imposed 

our operations outside the us may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions 

our operations in nonus jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than us law laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the us these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under us law moreover enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business in addition the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or us anticorruption laws applicable to our businesses as a result our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in nonus jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if us law governed these operations 

damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our business across segments and regions 

our reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses because our brands engage consumers across our businesses damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses because some of our brands are globally recognized brand damage may not be locally contained maintenance of the reputation of our company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate significant negative claims or publicity regarding the company or its operations products management employees practices business partners business decisions social responsibility and culture may damage our brands or reputation even if such claims are untrue damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales business opportunities profitability recruiting and valuation of our securities 

risks that impact our business as a whole may also impact the success of our directtoconsumer dtc business 

we may not successfully execute on our dtc strategy consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of dtc services potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn we face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent government regulation including revised foreign content and ownership regulations may impact the implementation of our dtc business plans poor quality broadband infrastructure in certain markets may impact our customers’ access to our dtc products and may diminish our customers’ experience with our dtc products these and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our dtc businesses 

volatility in the financial markets and our debt ratings have impacted our cost of borrowing and could impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments 

us and global markets have experienced significant volatility past disruptions in the us and global credit and equity markets made it more difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based in part on the company’s performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios 

since april 2020 standard and poor’s has downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to bbb downgraded our shortterm debt ratings by one notch to a2 and placed our longterm debt ratings on negative outlook in may 2020 fitch downgraded our long and shortterm credit ratings by one notch to a and f2 respectively and placed our longterm ratings 

tabl e of contents 

on negative outlook on november 18 2020 standard and poor’s lowered the company’s longterm rating to bbb and placed the company’s longterm ratings on negative outlook these ratings actions have increased and any potential future downgrades could further increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs could affect our ability to settle existing contracts and could also affect the ability of our business customers to obtain financing and thereby to satisfy their obligations to us 

labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

a significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers directors actors production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations in addition the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products and employees of providers of programming content such as sports leagues may be covered by labor agreements with their employers in general a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues and resolution of disputes may increase our costs 

the seasonality of certain of our businesses and timing of certain of our product offerings could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations 

each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations and variations in connection with the timing of our product offerings including as follows 

• revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns changes in viewership levels and timing of program sales in general advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months affiliate fees are typically recognized ratably throughout the year 

• revenues in our parks experiences and products segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities and seasonal consumer purchasing behavior which generally results in increased revenues during the company’s first and fourth fiscal quarters peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods our parks resorts stores and experiences are operating at diminished capacity or closed during these periods as a result of covid19 in addition licensing revenues fluctuate with the timing and performance of our theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts many of which have been delayed canceled or modified 

• revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical home entertainment and television markets release dates are determined by several factors including competition the timing of vacation and holiday periods and closing of theaters and impacts on attendance due to covid19 

• directtoconsumer  international revenues fluctuate based on changes in subscriber levels the timing and performance of releases of our digital media content viewership levels on our cable channels and digital platforms and the demand for sports and our content each of these may depend on the availability of content which varies from time to time throughout the year based on among other things sports seasons content production schedules and league shut downs 

accordingly negative impacts on our business occurring during a time of typical high seasonal demand could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year examples include the ongoing impact of covid19 on various high seasons or hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season 

sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability 

with approximately 203000 employees our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension and current and postretirement medical benefits we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors which are beyond our control including increases in the cost of health care impacts of covid19 may lead to an increase in the cost of medical insurance and expenses in addition changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension and postretirement medical expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years our pension and postretirement medical plans were remeasured at the end of fiscal 2020 and as a result the underfunded status and fiscal 2021 costs increased these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses

the alteration or discontinuation of libor may adversely affect our borrowing costs 

certain of our interest rate derivatives and a portion of our indebtedness bear interest at variable interest rates primarily based on libor which may be subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences in july 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 such announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee arcc which was convened by the federal reserve board and the new your fed has identified the secured oversight financing rate sofr as the recommended riskfree alternative rate for usd libor at this time it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or the establishment of alternative reference rates such as sofr or any other reference rate will have on the company however if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form the company’s borrowing costs may be adversely affected 

tfcf acquisition risks 

our consolidated indebtedness increased substantially following completion of the tfcf acquisition and may increase in connection with impacts of the covid19 this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility 

our consolidated indebtedness and cash and cash equivalents as of september 29 2018 were approximately 209 billion and 42 billion respectively with the completion of the tfcf acquisition our consolidated indebtedness and cash and cash equivalents as of september 28 2019 were approximately 470 billion and 54 billion respectively as of october 3 2020 our consolidated indebtedness and cash and cash equivalents were approximately 586 billion and 179 billion respectively the increased indebtedness could have the effect of among other things reducing our financial flexibility and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions such as those presented by covid19 among others increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for capital expenditures share repurchases and dividends and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels since april 2020 standard and poor’s has downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to bbb downgraded our shortterm debt ratings by one notch to a2 and placed our longterm debt ratings on negative outlook in may 2020 fitch downgraded our long and shortterm credit ratings by one notch to a and f2 respectively and placed our longterm ratings on negative outlook our financial flexibility may be further constrained by the issuance of shares of common stock in the tfcf acquisition to the extent we determine to make dividend payments in the future 

we could fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the tfcf acquisition 

if we are not able to realize the strategic value of the tfcf assets the anticipated benefits of the tfcf acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer than expected to be realized and these risks could be exacerbated by the impact of covid19 further there could be loss of key employees loss of customers disruption of ongoing businesses or unexpected issues higher than expected costs and an overall postacquisition process that takes longer than originally anticipated specifically the following issues among others must be addressed in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the tfcf acquisition so the combined company performs as we hope 

• combining the businesses of the company and tfcf in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the tfcf acquisition the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the tfcf acquisition not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all 

• maintaining existing agreements with customers distributors providers talent and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers distributors providers talent and vendors and 

• developing products and technology that allow value to be unlocked in the future 

consummation of the tfcf acquisition has increased our exposure to the risks of operating internationally 

we are a diversified entertainment company that offers entertainment travel and consumer products worldwide although many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside of the us the combination with tfcf has increased the importance of international operations to our future operations growth and prospects our risks of operating internationally have increased following the completion of the tfcf acquisition and as a result of covid19 

the tfcf acquisition and integration may result in additional costs and expenses 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the tfcf acquisition and integration we may also incur accounting and other costs that were not anticipated at the time of the tfcf acquisition including costs for which we have established reserves or which may lead to reserves in the future such costs could negatively impact the company’s free cash flow

significant developments 

strategic reorganization 

in october 2020 the company announced a strategic reorganization of our media and entertainment businesses to accelerate the growth of our dtc strategy the operations of the media networks studio entertainment and dtci segments were reorganized into four groups three content groups studios general entertainment and sports which are focused on developing and producing content that will be used across all of our traditional and dtc platforms and a distribution group which is focused on distribution and commercialization activities across these platforms and which has full accountability for media and entertainment operating results globally 

covid19 pandemic 

during fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021 the world has been and continues to be impacted by covid19 covid19 and measures to prevent its spread impacted our segments in a number of ways most significantly at parks experiences and products where our theme parks were closed or operating at significantly reduced capacity for a significant portion of the year cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended since late in the second quarter and retail stores were closed for a significant portion of the year we also had an adverse impact on our merchandise licensing business our studio entertainment segment has delayed or in some cases shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and stage play performances have been suspended since late in the second quarter we also had adverse impacts on advertising sales at media networks and directtoconsumer  international since march 2020 we have experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content including the shift of key live sports programming from our third quarter to the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021 as well as the suspension of production of most film and television content since late in the second quarter although some film and television production resumed in the fourth quarter 

we have taken a number of mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of covid19 on our businesses we have significantly increased cash balances through the issuance of senior notes in march and may 2020 and we entered into an additional 50 billion credit facility in april 2020 the company or our board of directors as applicable did not declare a dividend with respect to fiscal 2020 operations suspended certain capital projects reduced certain discretionary expenditures such as spending on marketing reduced management compensation for several months and temporarily eliminated board of director retainers and committee fees in addition we furloughed over 120000 of our employees who continued to receive company provided medical benefits many of which have returned from furlough as certain business operations have reopened at the end of september the company announced a workforce reduction plan that would primarily impact parks experiences and products overall approximately 32000 employees will be terminated in the first half of fiscal 2021 we may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing not declaring future dividends reducing or not making certain payments such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans further suspending capital spending reducing film and television content investments or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our businesses 

tabl e of contents 

the most significant impact of covid19 on fiscal 2020 operating results was an estimated detriment of approximately 69 billion on operating income at our parks experiences and products segment due to revenue lost as a result of the closures or reduced operating capacities the impacts at the media networks directtoconsumer  international and studio entertainment segments were less significant media networks had a modest benefit reflecting the deferral of sports programming costs to fiscal 2021 when we expect rescheduled events to occur partially offset by lower advertising revenue at directtoconsumer  international lower advertising revenue was partially offset by lower costs including the deferral of sports programming costs into fiscal 2021 at studio entertainment lower revenues due to the deferral or cancellation of significant film releases as a result of theater closures were partially offset by lower amortization marketing and distribution costs in total we estimate the net adverse impact of covid19 on our full year segment operating income across all of our businesses was approximately 74 billion inclusive of the impact at parks experiences and products the estimated impact is net of approximately 500 million in government credits from the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” in the us and a similar program in france both primarily at our parks experiences and products segment the impact in fiscal 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the impact on future period results including the impact of sports programming cost deferrals 

the impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will in turn depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of covid19 and among other things the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to covid19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward while we cannot be certain as to the duration of the impacts of covid19 we currently expect covid19 to adversely impact our financial results at least through fiscal 2021 

some of our businesses have reopened with limited operations we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees talent and guests for example as we reopened theme parks and retail stores we incurred and will continue to incur costs for such things as additional custodial services personal protection equipment temperature screenings and testing sanitizer and cleaning supplies and signage among other items as we resume production of film and television content including live sporting events we anticipate incurring similar costs and productions may take longer to complete the timing duration and extent of these costs will depend on the timing and scope of the resumption of our operations we currently estimate these costs may total approximately 1 billion in fiscal 2021 some of these costs may be capitalized and amortized over future periods with the unknown duration of covid19 and yet to be determined timing of the phased reopening of certain businesses it is not possible to precisely estimate the impact of covid19 on our operations in future quarters as we reopen our businesses we will no longer benefit from certain savings related to the closure of those businesses such as related furloughs the reopening or closure of our businesses is dependent on applicable government requirements which vary by location are subject to ongoing changes which could result from increasing covid19 cases

depreciation and amortization costs increased 28 or 12 billion to 53 billion due to the amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of tfcf and consolidation of hulu and to a lesser extent higher depreciation for new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts 

restructuring and impairment charges

investing activities consist principally of investments in parks resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity the company’s investments in parks resorts and other property for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are as follows 



capital expenditures at media networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers production facilities and television station facilities 

capital expenditures for the parks experiences and products segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion new attractions cruise ships capital improvements and systems infrastructure the decrease in capital expenditures at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower spend on star wars  galaxy’s edge at both the walt disney world and disneyland resorts capital spending in fiscal 2020 also reflected the suspension of certain capital projects as a result of covid19 

capital expenditures at directtoconsumer  international primarily reflect investments in technology the increase in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was due to spending on technology to support our streaming services 

capital expenditures at corporate primarily reflect investments in facilities information technology infrastructure and equipment the increase in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was due to higher spending on facilities 

the company currently expects its fiscal 2021 capital expenditures will be approximately 06 billion higher than fiscal 2020 capital expenditures of 40 billion due to increased spending on facilities at corporate and spending on technology at directtoconsumer  international partially offset by lower investments at our domestic parks and resorts in part reflecting a reduction in spending in response to covid19 

other investing activities 

the fiscal 2019 spending of 99 billion on acquisitions reflects 357 billion of cash paid to acquire tfcf less 257 billion of cash acquired in the transaction see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements cash provided by other investing activities of 172 million in fiscal 2020 reflects the proceeds from the sale of an investment while cash used in other investing activities of 319 million in fiscal 2019 reflects contributions of 347 million to hulu prior to the consolidation of hulu 

discontinued operations 

cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflects the sale of the rsns 

financing activities 

continuing operations 

cash provided by financing activities was 85 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to cash used in financing activities of 05 billion in fiscal 2019 cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020 was due to borrowings partially offset by dividend payments and settlement of acquisition related obligations the increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was from higher cash proceeds from net borrowings 112 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 37 billion in fiscal 2019

discontinued operations 

cash used in financing activities by discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 was due to redemption of noncontrolling interests of the rsns 

borrowings activities and other 

during the year ended october 3 2020 the company’s borrowing activity was as follows 



1 borrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net 

2 the other activity is primarily due to the amortization of purchase price adjustments on debt assumed in the tfcf acquisition and debt issuance fees 

3 the other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges 

see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s bank facilities the company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused 1225 billion bank facilities maturing in march 2021 march 2023 and march 2025 unused availability under the 50 billion bank facility maturing in april 2021 incremental term debt issuances and operating cash flows to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due 

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company’s dividends in fiscal 2020 and 2019 the company did not repurchase any of its shares in fiscal 2020 or 2019 

the company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control including covid19 which has affected our segment operations in a number of ways and as a result had an adverse impact on the company’s operating cash flows we have taken a number of measures to mitigate the impact on the company’s financial position we have significantly increased the company’s cash balances through the issuance of senior notes in march and may 2020 in addition we entered into an additional 50 billion credit facility in april 2020 bringing the total capacity of our bank facilities to 1725 billion see significant developments for the impact covid19 had on our operations and mitigating measures 

despite the impact of covid19 we believe that the company’s financial condition remains strong and that its cash balances other liquid assets operating cash flows access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects although certain of these activities have been scaled back or suspended in light of covid19 in addition to measures the company has already taken in response to covid19 there are a number of additional mitigating actions the company may take in the future such as not declaring dividends which the board of directors did not declare with respect to fiscal 2020 operations reducing or not making certain payments such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans raising additional financing further suspending capital spending reducing film and television content investments or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force 

the company’s borrowing costs can also be impacted by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies which are based in significant part on the company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios as of october 3 2020 moody’s investors service’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a2 and p1 respectively standard and poor’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a and a2 respectively and fitch’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a and f2 respectively in addition fitch has placed the company’s longterm debt rating on negative outlook on november 18 2020 standard and poor’s lowered the company’s longterm rating to bbb and placed the company’s longterm ratings on negative outlook the company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant relating to interest coverage which the company met on october 3 2020 by a significant margin the company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities including the asia theme parks from any representations covenants or events of default 

tabl e of contents 

the duration of business closures and other impacts related to covid19 and the corresponding duration of the impacts to our operating cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty these impacts to our operating cash flows may require us to rely more heavily on external funding sources such as debt and other types of financing 

supplemental guarantor financial information 

on march 20 2019 as part of the acquisition of tfcf the walt disney company “twdc” became the ultimate parent of twdc enterprises 18 corp formerly known as the walt disney company “legacy disney” legacy disney and twdc are collectively referred to as “obligor group” and individually as a “guarantor” concurrent with the close of the tfcf acquisition 168 billion of tfcf’s assumed public debt which then constituted 96 of such debt was exchanged for senior notes of twdc the “exchange notes” issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” pursuant to an indenture dated as of march 20 2019 between twdc legacy disney as guarantor and citibank na as trustee the “twdc indenture” and guaranteed by legacy disney on november 26 2019 140 billion of the outstanding exchange notes were exchanged for new senior notes of twdc registered under the securities act issued pursuant to the twdc indenture and guaranteed by legacy disney in addition contemporaneously with the closing of the march 20 2019 exchange offer twdc entered into a guarantee of the registered debt securities issued by legacy disney under the indenture dated as of september 24 2001 between legacy disney and wells fargo bank national association as trustee the “2001 trustee” as amended by the first supplemental indenture among legacy disney as issuer twdc as guarantor and the 2001 trustee as trustee 

other subsidiaries of the company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either twdc or legacy disney such subsidiaries are referred to as the “nonguarantors” the par value and carrying value of total outstanding and guaranteed registered debt securities of the obligor group at october 3 2020 was as follows 



the guarantees by twdc and legacy disney are full and unconditional and cover all payment obligations arising under the guaranteed registered debt securities the guarantees may be released and discharged upon i as a general matter the indebtedness for borrowed money of the consolidated subsidiaries of twdc in aggregate constituting no more than 10 of all consolidated indebtedness for borrowed money of twdc and its subsidiaries subject to certain exclusions ii upon the sale transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the equity interests or all or substantially all or substantially as an entirety the assets of legacy disney to a third party and iii other customary events constituting a discharge of a guarantor’s obligations in addition in the case of legacy disney’s guarantee of registered debt securities issued by twdc legacy disney may be released and discharged from its guarantee at any time legacy disney is not a borrower issuer or guarantor under certain material bank facilities or any debt securities 

operations are conducted almost entirely through the company’s subsidiaries accordingly the obligor group’s cash flow and ability to service its debt including the public debt are dependent upon the earnings of the company’s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the obligor group whether by dividends loans or otherwise holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities have a direct claim only against the obligor group

contractual obligations commitments and off balance sheet arrangements 

the company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements for example the company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of our significant accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

produced and acquiredlicensed content costs 

at the beginning of fiscal 2020 the company adopted on a prospective basis new financial accounting standards board fasb guidance that updates the accounting for film and television content costs under that new guidance we amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues ultimate revenues 

with respect to produced films intended for theatrical release the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues is theatrical performance revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance the company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows including intersegment content transactions and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends 

with respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of ultimate revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms program ratings which are an indication of market acceptance directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons 

ultimate revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment conversely if our estimate of ultimate revenues increases cost amortization may be slowed 

produced content costs that are part of a group and acquiredlicensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straightline amortization pattern the determination of projected usage requires judgement and is reviewed periodically for changes if projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense 

the amortization of multiyear sports rights is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue relative value if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season if estimated relative values by year were to change significantly amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed 

revenue recognition 

the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for our revenue recognition policies 

pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions 

the company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense andor liability measurement which we evaluate annually other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increase 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense the guideline for setting this rate is a highquality longterm corporate bond rate we reduced our discount rate to 282 at the end of fiscal 2020 from 322 at the end of fiscal 2019 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2020 yearend measurement date the company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of highquality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2021 by approximately 351 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at october 3 2020 by approximately 40 billion a one 

tabl e of contents 

percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately 303 million and 34 billion respectively 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class our expected return on plan assets is 700 a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense a one percentage point change in the longterm asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2021 annual expense by approximately 164 million 

goodwill other intangible assets longlived assets and investments 

the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require on an interim basis 

goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment to test goodwill for impairment the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value if it is a quantitative assessment is required alternatively the company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test 

the qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit 

the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

in fiscal 2020 the company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment 

the impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill and the determination of fair value of the reporting units to determine the fair value of our reporting units we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flows corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate the projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy the company’s longterm cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual 

to test its other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinitelived intangible assets exceeds its fair value if it is a quantitative assessment is required alternatively the company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test 

the qualitative assessment requires consideration of recent market transactions macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows 

the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for the excess fair values of indefinitelived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values as appropriate 

the company tests longlived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering events indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable once a triggering event has occurred the impairment test employed is based on whether the company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group an asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group for assets held for sale to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell an impairment loss is recognized for the difference determining whether a longlived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions including whether a triggering event has occurred the identification of asset groups estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values 

tabl e of contents 

the company has investments in equity securities for equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherit in the external markets for these investments if these forecasts are not met impairment charges may be recorded 

the company recorded noncash impairment charges of 52 billion and 06 billion in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of mvpd agreement intangibles assets 19 billion and goodwill 31 billion at the international channels’ business as discussed below under “impacts of covid19 on accounting policies and estimates” 

the fiscal 2019 charges primarily related to impairments of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting recorded in “equity in the income loss of investees” in the consolidated statements of operations 

allowance for credit losses 

we evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business in times of domestic or global economic turmoil including covid19 our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low costs and expenses may increase in future periods and if it is too high costs and expenses may decrease in future periods 

contingencies and litigation 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings these estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate from time to time we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure 

income tax 

as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in proposed assessments our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings or negotiations with taxing and legal authorities the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors including the company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities 

impacts of covid19 on accounting policies and estimates 

in light of the currently unknown ultimate duration and severity of covid19 we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply our significant accounting policies as covid19 continues to develop we may make changes to these estimates and judgments over time which could result in meaningful impacts to our financial statements in future periods a more detailed discussion of the impact of covid19 on the accounting policies and estimates follows 

produced and acquiredlicensed content costs 

certain of our completed or in progress film and television productions have had their initial release dates delayed or canceled the duration of the delay market conditions when we release the content or a change in our release strategy eg bypassing certain distribution windows could have an impact on ultimate revenues which may accelerate amortization or result in an impairment of capitalized film and television production costs 

given the ongoing uncertainty around the resumption and continuation of live sporting events the amount and timing of revenues derived from the broadcast of these events may differ from the projections of revenues that support our amortization pattern of the rights costs we pay for these events such changes in revenues could result in an acceleration or slowing of the amortization of our sports rights costs 

tabl e of contents 

revenue recognition 

certain of our affiliate contracts contain commitments with respect to the content to be aired on our television networks eg live sports or original content if there are delays or cancellations of live sporting events or disruptions to film and television content production activities we may need to assess the impact on our contractual obligations and adjust the revenue that we recognize related to these contracts 

goodwill other intangible assets longlived assets and investments 

given the ongoing impacts of covid19 across our businesses the projected cash flows that we use to assess the fair value of our businesses and assets for purposes of impairment testing are subject to greater uncertainty than normal if in the future we reduce our estimate of cash flow projections we may need to impair some of these assets 

our international channels reporting unit which is part of the directtoconsumer  international segment comprises the company’s international television networks our international television networks primarily derive revenues from affiliate fees charged to mvpds for the right to deliver our programming under multiyear licensing agreements and the sales of advertising timespace on the networks a majority of the operations in this reporting unit were acquired in the tfcf acquisition and therefore the fair value of these businesses approximated the carrying value at the date of the acquisition of tfcf 

the international channels business has been negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic resulting in decreased viewership and lower advertising revenue related to the availability of content including the deferral or cancellation of certain live sporting events the company’s increased focus on dtc distribution in international markets is expected to negatively impact the international channels business as we shift the primary means of monetizing our film and television content from licensing of linear channels to use on our dtc services because the international channels reporting unit valuation does not include the value derived from this shift which is reflected in other reporting units in addition the industry shift to dtc including by us and many of our distributors who are pursuing their own dtc strategies has changed the competitive dynamics for the international channels business and resulted in unfavorable affiliation renewal terms for certain of our distribution agreements 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we assessed the international channels’ longlived assets and goodwill for impairment and recorded impairments of 19 billion primarily related to mvpd agreement intangible assets and 31 billion related to goodwill 

see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impairment tests performed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 

risk management contracts 

the company employs a variety of financial instruments derivatives including interest rate and crosscurrency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

changes to our hedged cash flows from a decrease in projected revenues of the company or reductions of projected usage of commodities as compared to our projections when we entered into hedges may cause us to recognize gains or losses on our hedging instruments in our income statement prior to when the hedged transaction was projected to occur 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements 

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for “forwardlooking statements” made by or on behalf of the company we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forwardlooking” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to our shareholders such statements may for example express expectations projections estimates or future impacts actions that we may take or not take or developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions all forwardlooking statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance as of the time the statements are made and the company does not undertake any obligation to update its disclosure relating to forwardlooking matters actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under item 1a – risk factors of this report on form 10k as well as in this item 7  management’s discussion and analysis and item 1  business

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments 

policies and procedures 

in the normal course of business we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments 

our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company’s portfolio of borrowings by policy the company targets fixedrate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges accordingly the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the us dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets liabilities commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable but not firmly committed transactions the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro japanese yen british pound chinese yuan and canadian dollar crosscurrency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to us dollar denominated borrowings by policy the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures the economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country 

our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities such as fuel oil and gasoline 

it is the company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes 

value at risk var 

the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation the company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates currencies commodities and equity prices a variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate foreign currency commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at each fiscal quarter end the model includes all of the company’s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts commodities and market sensitive equity investments forecasted transactions firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the model 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

var on a combined basis increased to 323 million at october 3 2020 from 322 million at september 28 2019 

tabl e of contents 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model is as follows unaudited in millions 



the var for hong kong disneyland resort and shanghai disney resort is immaterial as of october 3 2020 and accordingly has been excluded from the above table

the company’s international channels face competition from other networks for carriage by mvpds the company’s contractual agreements with mvpds are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business consolidation and other market conditions in the cable satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the company’s ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for distribution that are as favorable as those currently in place

 item 1a risk factors 

for an enterprise as large and complex as the company a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following 

changes in us global or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses 

a decline in economic activity in the us and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses thus reducing our revenue and earnings past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts purchases of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations performance of our home entertainment releases and purchases of companybranded consumer products and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur a decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming or directtoconsumer products economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us in addition an increase in price levels generally or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer which could also adversely affect our revenues and at the same time increase our costs a decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our expansion plans changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in nonus markets or reduce the us dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets economic or political conditions in a country could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country 

misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

our businesses create entertainment travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create filmed entertainment and television programming which may be distributed among other ways through broadcast cable internet or cellular technology theme park attractions hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content the success of our theme parks and experiences as well as our theatrical releases depends on demand for public or outofhome entertainment experiences many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the us and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the us moreover we must often invest substantial amounts in film production television programming other content production acquisition of sports rights theme park attractions cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we know the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance our revenue from advertising sales which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air affiliate fees subscription fees theatrical film receipts the license of rights to other distributors theme park admissions hotel room charges and merchandise food and beverage sales sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses 

changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products 

the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies new technologies affect the demand for our products the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams the sources and nature of competing content offerings the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences this trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution as evidenced by the industrywide decline in ratings for broadcast television the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels including for a number of our networks in order to respond to these developments we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models most recently by developing dtc products for certain sports programming on espn launched in 2018 and for filmed entertainment and other programming on disney launched in november 2019 and increasing our stake in hulu assumed full operational control in may 2019 there can be no assurance that our dtc offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes and we expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources there can be no assurance that the dtc model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be as profitable as our existing business models 

the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create 

the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights or if existing laws are changed our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase 

the unauthorized use of our intellectual property may increase the cost of protecting rights in our intellectual property or reduce our revenues the convergence of computing communication and entertainment devices increased broadband internet speed and penetration increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging the unauthorized distribution and access to entertainment content generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect entertainment industry intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the company’s operations worldwide despite the company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content 

with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright trademark and patent rights by third parties successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights 

protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection we may incur additional costs lost opportunities and damage to our reputation 

we maintain information necessary to conduct our business including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees in digital form data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of unauthorized access modification and exfiltration we develop and maintain information security systems in an effort to prevent this but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated accordingly despite our efforts unauthorized access modification and exfiltration of data cannot be eliminated entirely and the risks associated with a potentially material incident remain in addition we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and where we believe appropriate monitor the protections employed by these third parties there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised if our information security systems or data are compromised in a material way our ability to conduct our business may be impaired we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and as described above we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated our reputation with our customers and employees may be damaged resulting in loss of business or morale and we may incur costs to remediate possible harm to our customers and employees andor to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident 

a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services 

demand for our products and services particularly our theme parks and resorts is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism the environment for travel and tourism as well as demand for other entertainment products can be significantly adversely affected in the us globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including adverse weather conditions arising from shortterm weather patterns or longterm change catastrophic events or natural disasters such as excessive heat or rain hurricanes typhoons floods tsunamis and earthquakes health concerns international political or military developments and terrorist attacks these events and others such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events an incident that affected our property directly would have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could have an extended effect of discouraging consumers from attending our facilities moreover the costs of protecting against such incidents reduces the profitability of our operations 

for example events in hong kong have impacted profitability of our hong kong operations and may continue to do so there and elsewhere and past hurricanes have impacted profitability of walt disney world resort in florida and future hurricanes may also do so 

in addition we derive affiliate fees and royalties from the distribution of our programming sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of those third parties the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected 

we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles exclusions terms conditions and limits of liability the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss and we may experience material losses not covered by our insurance 

changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses 

as changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise decide to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets in addition external events including changing technology changing consumer patterns acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may 

impair the value of our assets when these changes or events occur we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets we also make investments in existing or new businesses including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines in recent years such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme parks expansion of our fleet of cruise ships and investments related to directtoconsumer offerings some of these investments may have shortterm returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses related to these investments may be uncertain in any of these events our costs may increase we may have significant charges associated with the writedown of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring 

increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs 

we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment lodging tourism and recreational activities this includes among other types competition for human resources programming and other resources we require in operating our business for example 

 our results may be adversely affected if longterm programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms 

we enter into longterm contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors as these contracts expire we must renew or renegotiate the contracts and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms we may lose programming rights or distribution rights even if these contracts are renewed the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase or increase at faster rates than our historical experience or programming distributors facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges may demand terms including pricing and the breadth of distribution that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience moreover our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by recent consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms with respect to the acquisition of programming rights particularly sports programming rights the impact of these longterm contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors including the strength of advertising markets subscription levels and rates for programming effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming 

changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses 

our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of us and overseas regulations these regulations include   

 changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable for example in january 2019 india implemented regulation and tariffs impacting certain bundling of channels 

our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions 

our operations in nonus jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than us law laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the us these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under us law moreover enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business in addition the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or united states anticorruption laws applicable to our businesses as a result our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in nonus jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if us law governed these operations 

damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our business across segments and regions 

our reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses because our brands engage consumers across our segments damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses because some of our brands are globally recognized brand damage may not be locally contained maintenance of the reputation of our company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate significant negative claims or publicity regarding the company or its operations products management employees practices business partners and culture may damage our brands or reputation even if such claims are untrue damage to our reputation or brands may impact our sales business opportunities and profitability 

risks that impact our business as a whole may also impact the success of our directtoconsumer dtc business 

we may not successfully execute on our directtoconsumer strategy consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of dtc services potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn we face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent government regulation including revised foreign content and ownership regulations may impact the implementation of our dtc business plans poor quality broadband infrastructure in certain markets may impact our customers’ access to our dtc products and may diminish our customers’ experience with our dtc products these and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our dtc businesses 

turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments 

past disruptions in the us and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based in part on the company’s performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing andor make it more difficult for us to obtain financing past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs could affect our ability to settle existing contracts and could also affect the ability of our business customers to obtain financing and thereby to satisfy their obligations to us 

labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses 

a significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers directors actors production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations in addition the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products and employees of providers of programming content such as sports leagues may be covered by labor agreements with their employers in general a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues and resolution of disputes may increase our costs 

the seasonality of certain of our businesses and timing of certain of our product offerings could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations 

each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations and variations in connection with the timing of our product offerings including as follows   

 accordingly if a shortterm negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year 

sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability 

with approximately 223000 employees our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macroeconomic factors which are beyond our control including increases in the cost of health care in addition changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses 

the alteration or discontinuation of libor may adversely affect our borrowing costs 

certain of our interest rate derivatives and a portion of our indebtedness bear interest at variable interest rates primarily based on libor which may be subject to regulatory guidance andor reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences in july 2017 the chief executive of the uk financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 such announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021 at this time it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other reference rate or the establishment of alternative reference rates will have on the company however if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form the company’s borrowing costs may be adversely affected 

risk factors related to the tfcf acquisition 

the tfcf acquisition may not be accretive and may be dilutive to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

the tfcf acquisition is not currently accretive to our earnings per share our expectations regarding the timeframe in which the tfcf acquisition may become accretive to our earnings per share excluding the impact of purchase accounting may not be realized in addition we could fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the tfcf acquisition or experience delays or inefficiencies in realizing such benefits such factors could combined with the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the tfcf acquisition result in the tfcf acquisition continuing to be dilutive to our earnings per share which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

although we expect that the tfcf acquisition will result in synergies and other benefits to us we may not realize those benefits because of challenges inherently associated with integration performance and the achievement of synergies 

the company and tfcf were operated independently until completion of the tfcf acquisition and there can be no assurances that our businesses can be combined in a manner that allows for the achievement of substantial benefits for a discussion of tfcf’s contribution to the company in fiscal 2019 see management’s discussion and analysis if we are delayed or not able to successfully integrate tfcf’s businesses with ours pursue our directtoconsumer strategy successfully or realize the strategic value of the tfcf assets the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the tfcf acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer than expected to be realized further it is possible that there could be loss of key employees loss of customers disruption of ongoing businesses or unexpected issues higher than expected costs and an overall postacquisition process that takes longer than originally anticipated specifically the following issues among others must be addressed in the integration of tfcf businesses in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the tfcf acquisition so the combined company performs as we hope 

 the tfcf acquisition was announced in december 2017 and closed march 2019 with integration activities currently ongoing the pursuit of the tfcf acquisition preparation for the integration of tfcf and integration of tfcf have placed a significant burden on our management and internal resources and the integration of tfcf may continue to do so this may disrupt our ongoing business and the business of the combined company 

consummation of the tfcf acquisition has increased our exposure to the risks of operating internationally 

we are a diversified entertainment company that offers entertainment travel and consumer products worldwide although many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside of the us the combination with tfcf has increased the importance of international operations to our future operations growth and prospects the risks of operating internationally that we face have increased following the completion of the tfcf acquisition 

the tfcf acquisition and integration may result in additional costs and expenses 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the tfcf acquisition and integration we may also incur accounting and other costs in the integration of the businesses of tfcf that were not anticipated at the time of the acquisition including costs for which we have established reserves or which may lead to reserves in the future such costs could negatively impact the company’s free cash flow 

our consolidated indebtedness has increased substantially following completion of the tfcf acquisition this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility 

our consolidated indebtedness as of september 29 2018 was approximately 209 billion with the completion of the tfcf acquisition our consolidated indebtedness as of september 28 2019 was approximately 470 billion the increased indebtedness could have the effect of among other things reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions the increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for capital expenditures share 

repurchases and dividends and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels our financial flexibility may be further constrained by the issuance of shares of common stock in the tfcf acquisition because of dividend payments

lower home entertainment revenue reflected a 5 decrease from lower unit sales partially offset by an increase of 3 from higher average net effective pricing lower unit sales were driven by the success of moana and finding dory in fiscal 2017 compared to coco and cars 3 in fiscal 2018 the decrease was also driven by three liveaction titles in fiscal 2017 as compared to two liveaction titles in fiscal 2018 and the carryover performance of fiscal 2016 new release titles in fiscal 2017 compared to the carryover performance of fiscal 2017 new release titles in fiscal 2018 these decreases were partially offset by the release of three marvel titles and two lucasfilm titles in fiscal 2018 compared to two marvel titles and one lucasfilm title in fiscal 2017 the increase in average net effective pricing was due to higher rates and a higher sales mix of bluray discs partially offset by a lower mix of new release titles 

tvsvod distribution and other revenue reflected a 5 increase from tvsvod distribution and a 3 increase from stage plays the increase in tvsvod distribution revenue was due to an increase in our free television business driven by 

new international agreements and the sale of star wars the force awakens in fiscal 2018 with no comparable title in fiscal 2017 higher stage play revenue was due to the opening of additional productions in fiscal 2018 

costs and expenses 

operating expenses include film cost amortization which increase d 625 million  from 2562 million to 3187 million and cost of goods sold and distribution costs which increase d 106 million  from 1156 million to 1262 million  higher film cost amortization was due to the impact of higher theatrical distribution revenues higher cost of goods sold and distribution costs were due to an increase in stage play production and theatrical distribution costs 

selling general administrative and other costs increased 337 million from 2156 million to 2493 million primarily due to higher theatrical marketing costs reflecting more titles released in fiscal 2018 and to a lesser extent higher stage play marketing costs due to additional productions in fiscal 2018 

segment operating income 

segment operating income increase d 27  or 641 million to 3004 million due to an increase in theatrical distribution results 

directtoconsumer  international 

operating results for the directtoconsumer  international segment are as follows   



revenues 

the increase in affiliate fees was due to an increase of 5 from higher contractual rates partially offset by a decrease of 2 from an unfavorable foreign exchange impact 

advertising revenue increase d 1 as higher addressable ad sales were largely offset by lower revenue generated from content distributed on youtube 

other revenue increase d 284 million due to the consolidation of bamtech in fiscal 2017 the company acquired a controlling interest in bamtech and began consolidating its results the company’s share of bamtech’s results was previously reported in equity in the loss of investees 

costs and expenses 

operating expenses included a 147 million increase in programming and production costs from 1425 million to 1572 million and a 254 million increase in other operating expenses from 558 million to 812 million  the increase in programming and production costs was due to the consolidation of bamtech partially offset by lower talent costs for digital programming other operating costs which include technical support and distribution costs increase d due to the consolidation of bamtech 

selling general administrative and other costs increase d 142 million from 861 million to 1003 million due to the consolidation of bamtech partially offset by lower marketing costs at our international channels 

depreciation and amortization increase d 91 million from 94 million to 185 million due to the consolidation of bamtech 

equity in the loss of investees 

loss from equity investees increase d 159 million from a loss of 421 million to a loss of 580 million primarily due to a higher loss from our investment in hulu partially offset by a favorable comparison to a loss from bamtech in fiscal 2017 on september 25 2017 the company acquired a controlling interest in bamtech and began consolidating its results the company’s share of bamtech’s results was previously reported in equity in the loss of investees the higher loss at hulu was driven by higher programming labor and marketing costs partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenue 

segment operating loss 

segment operating loss increase d 454 million  to 738 million due to the consolidation of bamtech and a higher loss from hulu partially offset by growth at our international channels 

the following table presents supplemental revenue and operating incomeloss detail for the directtoconsumer  international segment to provide information on international channels that were historically reported in the media networks segment 



eliminations 

intersegment content transactions are as follows 



corporate and unallocated shared expenses 

corporate and unallocated shared expenses are as follows   



the increases in corporate and unallocated shared expenses from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 and from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 were due to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of tfcf and higher compensation costs 

restructuring in connection with the acquisition of tfcf 

as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in connection with the acquisition of tfcf the company has begun implementing a restructuring and integration plan as a part of its initiative to realize cost synergies from the acquisition of tfcf during fiscal 2019 we recorded charges of 12 billion  including 09 billion of severance and related costs in connection with the plan and 03 billion of equitybased compensation costs primarily for tfcf awards that were accelerated to vest upon the closing of the tfcf acquisition these charges are recorded in “restructuring and impairment charges” in the consolidated statements of income although our plans are not yet finalized we anticipate that the total severance and related costs could be on the order of 15 billion the company may incur other restructuring costs such as contract termination costs but we expect these will not be material for fiscal 2018 restructuring and impairment charges were not material 

the following table summarizes the changes in restructuring reserves related to tfcf integration efforts in fiscal 2019 



significant developments 

in november 2019 the company launched disney a subscription based directtoconsumer streaming service with disney pixar marvel star wars and national geographic branded programming in the us and four other countries further launches are planned for western europe in spring 2020 latin america in fall 2021 eastern europe starting in late 2020 and continuing in 2021 and various asiapacific territories throughout 2020 and 2021 as we will use our branded film and television content on the disney service we expect to forgo licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties in tvsvod markets in addition we anticipate an increase in programming and production investments to create exclusive content for disney 

due to the circumstances in hong kong we have seen a significant decrease in tourism from china and other parts of asia to hong kong disneyland resort if current trends continue hong kong disneyland resorts fiscal 2020 operating income could decrease by approximately 275 million compared to fiscal 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

the change in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash is as follows   



operating activities 

continuing operations 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 decreased 58 or 83 billion to 60 billion compared to fiscal 2018 due to the payment of approximately 76 billion of tax obligations that arose from the spinoff of fox corporation in connection with the tfcf acquisition and the sale of the rsns acquired with tfcf higher pension plan contributions and higher interest payments lower operating cash flows at our dtci and media networks segments were largely offset by increases at parks experiences and products and studio entertainment the decreases at dtci and media networks were due to higher film and television spending and operating disbursements partially offset by higher operating cash receipts driven by increases in revenue the increases at studio entertainment and parks experiences and products were due to higher operating cash receipts driven by increases in revenue the increase at studio entertainment was partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses the increase at parks experiences and products was partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by cost inflation and higher marketing expenses 

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 increased 16 or 20 billion to 143 billion compared to fiscal 2017 due to a decrease in tax payments resulting from the tax act a decrease in pension plan contributions and higher operating cash flows at studio entertainment and parks experiences and products partially offset by lower operating cash flows at media networks and dtci and a payment for the rights to develop a real estate property in new york the increase in operating cash flow at studio entertainment was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by an increase in revenue partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses parks experiences and products cash flow reflected higher operating cash receipts due to increased revenue partially offset by higher payments for labor and other costs lower operating cash flow at media networks was due to higher television production spending the decrease in operating cash flow at dtci was due to higher operating cash disbursements

the company’s film and television production and programming activity related to continuing operations for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017 are as follows 



discontinued operations 

cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflected the operations of the rsns 

investing activities 

continuing operations 

investing activities consist principally of investments in parks resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity the company’s investments in parks resorts and other property for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017 are as follows 



capital expenditures for the parks experiences and products segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion new attractions cruise ships capital improvements and systems infrastructure the increase in capital expenditures at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to higher spending on new attractions at walt disney world resort partially offset by lower spending on new attractions at disneyland resort while the increase in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on new attractions at walt disney world resort and disneyland resort including star wars galaxy’s edge the increase in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to higher spending at disneyland paris while the decrease in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to lower spending at shanghai disney resort and hong kong disneyland resort 

capital expenditures at media networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers production facilities and television station facilities 

capital expenditures at dtci primarily reflect investments in technology the increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on technology to support our dtc services 

capital expenditures at corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities information technology infrastructure and equipment the increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was driven by investments in corporate facilities 

the company currently expects its fiscal 2020 capital expenditures will be approximately 05 billion higher than fiscal 2019 capital expenditures of 49 billion due to increased spending on technology and facilities at dtci and corporate 

other investing activities 

the fiscal 2019 spending of 99 billion on acquisitions reflects 357 billion of cash paid to acquire tfcf less 257 billion of cash acquired in the transaction see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements cash used in other investing activities of 319 million in fiscal 2019 reflects contributions of 347 million to hulu prior to the consolidation of hulu

discontinued operations 

cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflects the sale of the rsns 

financing activities 

continuing operations 

cash used in financing activities was  05 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to  88 billion in fiscal 2018  the net use of cash in the current year was due to 29 billion in dividends and 14 billion in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests partially offset by proceeds from borrowing of 37 billion  the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to a net increase in borrowings in the current year compared to net repayments in the prior year 37 billion borrowing in fiscal 2019 compared to 26 billion repayment in fiscal 2018 and the absence of common stock repurchases in the current year compared to 36 billion in fiscal 2018 partially offset by acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in the current year 14 billion in fiscal 2019 

cash used in financing activities was  88 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to 90 billion in fiscal 2017  the net use of cash in fiscal 2018 was due to 36 billion of common stock repurchases 25 billion in dividends and a net repayment of borrowings of 26 billion  cash used in financing activities was comparable to fiscal 2017 as lower common stock repurchases  36 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to 94 billion in fiscal 2017  and higher contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of 04 billion was essentially offset by a net repayment of borrowings in fiscal 2018 compared to a net increase in borrowings in fiscal 2017  26 billion repayment in fiscal 2018 compared to 37 billion borrowing in fiscal 2017  

discontinued operations 

cash used in financing activities by discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 was due to redemption of noncontrolling interests of the rsns 

borrowings activities and other 

during the year ended september 28 2019  the company’s borrowing activity was as follows 



 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s bank facilities the company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due 

see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company’s dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  

we believe that the company’s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances other liquid assets operating cash flows access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects however the company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control in addition to macroeconomic factors the company’s borrowing costs can be impacted by short and longterm debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies which are based in significant part on the company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios as of 

september 28 2019  moody’s investors service’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a2 and p1 respectively standard and poor’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a and a1 and fitch’s long and shortterm debt ratings for the company were a and f1 respectively the company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant relating to interest coverage which the company met on september 28 2019  by a significant margin the company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities including the asia theme parks from any representations covenants or events of default 

contractual obligations commitments and off balance sheet arrangements 

the company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements for example the company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at september 28 2019 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash in addition the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as referenced in the table   



 

the company also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

contingent commitments and contractual guarantees 

see notes 4 7 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s contingent commitments and contractual guarantees 

legal and tax matters 

as disclosed in notes 10 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements the company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we believe that the application of the following accounting policies which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management for a summary of our significant accounting policies including the accounting policies discussed below see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

film and television revenues and costs 

we produce films and television series for distribution in the theatrical and television markets and on our dtc streaming services we expense the production participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues ultimate revenues for each production if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated conversely if our estimate of ultimate revenues increases film and television cost amortization may be slowed for film productions ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release for television series ultimate revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode or if still in production five years from delivery of the most recent episode if later 

with respect to films intended for theatrical release the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues and therefore affecting future film cost amortization andor impairment is theatrical performance revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release eg the home entertainment or television markets have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance the company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products 

with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of ultimate revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market program ratings which are an indication of market acceptance directly affect the company’s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program in addition television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors svod services and in home entertainment formats alternatively poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program which would require an immediate writedown of any unamortized production costs a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates 

we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series movies and other programs based on an accelerated or straightline basis over the useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired as appropriate amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program’s ratings in previous airings expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming accordingly planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary we amortize rights costs for multiyear sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement the estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed 

we also acquire license and produce films and television series for our directtoconsumer streaming platforms we expense these costs based on historical and estimated viewing patterns which may be on an accelerated or straightline basis as appropriate 

costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type the company’s dayparts are primetime daytime late night news and sports includes broadcast and cable networks the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program 

estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections film television and programming cost writedowns may be required 

for film and television series that are exploited on our directtoconsumer streaming services the unamortized costs are reviewed for impairment on an aggregate basis for each service 

fixed license fees charged for the right to use our television and motion picture productions are recognized as revenue when the content is available for use by the licensee tvsvod distribution contracts may contain more than one title andor provide that certain titles are only available for use during defined periods of time during the contract term in these instances each title andor period of availability is generally considered a separate performance obligation for these contracts license fees are allocated to each title and period of availability at contract inception based on relative standalone selling price using managements best estimate estimates used to determine a performance obligations standalone selling price impact the timing of revenue recognition but not the total revenue to be recognized under the arrangements 

revenue recognition 

the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business we have updated our revenue recognition policies in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance as further described in note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements 

pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions 

the company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets are important elements of expense andor liability measurement which we evaluate annually other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns mortality turnover and rate of compensation increase 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense the guideline for setting this rate is a highquality longterm corporate bond rate we reduced our discount rate to 322 at the end of fiscal 2019 from 431 at the end of fiscal 2018 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2019 yearend measurement date the company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of highquality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2020 by approximately 313 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at september 28 2019 by approximately 36 billion  a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately 273 million and 30 billion  respectively 

to determine the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class our expected return on plan assets is 725  a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense while a higher expected rate of return on pension plan assets will decrease pension expense a one percentage point change in the longterm asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2020 annual benefit expense by approximately 157 million  

goodwill other intangible assets longlived assets and investments 

the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require on an interim basis goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

the impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill and the determination of fair value of the reporting units to determine the fair value of our reporting units we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flows corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy the company’s longterm cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual in addition the projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property as if it was licensed to an unrelated third party we believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units 

the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinitelived intangible assets to their carrying amounts if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized for the excess fair values of other indefinitelived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values as appropriate 

the company tests longlived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering events indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable once a triggering event has occurred the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group an asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments if the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s longlived assets and the carrying value of the group’s longlived assets the impairment is allocated to the longlived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value for assets held for sale to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell an impairment loss is recognized for the difference determining whether a longlived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions including whether a triggering event has occurred the identification of the asset groups estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values 

the company tested its goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets for impairment the impairment charges recorded for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 were not material 

for fiscal 2019 the fair value of our international channels reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by less than 10 our international channels reporting unit comprises the company’s international cable networks that provide programming under multiyear licensing agreements with mvpds a majority of the operations in this reporting unit consist of businesses acquired in the tfcf acquisition and therefore the fair value approximates carrying value goodwill of this reporting unit is approximately 3 billion changes to key assumptions market trends or macroeconomic events could produce test results in the future that differ and we could be required to record an impairment charge 

the company has investments in equity securities for equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherit in the external markets for these investments if these forecasts are not met impairment charges may be recorded 

the company tested its investments for impairment and recorded noncash impairment charges of 538 million and 210 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 impairment charges were recorded in “equity in the income loss of investees net” in the consolidated statements of income the fiscal 2017 impairment charges recorded were not material 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business in times of domestic or global economic turmoil our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low costs and expenses may increase in future periods and if it is too high costs and expenses may decrease in future periods 

contingencies and litigation 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings these estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate from time to time we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure 

income tax audits 

as a matter of course the company is regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities from time to time these audits result in proposed assessments the acquisition of tfcf increased the company’s uncertain tax benefits as the company assumed the tax liabilities of tfcf the company is still obtaining information related to the evaluation of the 

income tax impact of certain preacquisition transactions of tfcf which may result in adjustments to the recorded amount of uncertain tax benefits our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel where appropriate and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings or negotiations with taxing and legal authorities the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors including the company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements 

forwardlooking statements 

the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forwardlooking” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the sec and in reports to our shareholders such statements may for example express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take including restructuring or strategic initiatives or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions these statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements there can be no assurance however that our expectations will necessarily come to pass significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under item 1a – risk factors of this report on form 10k as well as in this item 7  management’s discussion and analysis and item 1  business 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes foreign currency fluctuations commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments 

policies and procedures 

in the normal course of business we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company’s exposure to changes in interest rates foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments 

our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company’s portfolio of borrowings by policy the company targets fixedrate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges accordingly the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the us dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets liabilities commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable but not firmly committed transactions the company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro japanese yen british pound chinese yuan and canadian dollar crosscurrency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to us dollar denominated borrowings by policy the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the us dollar equivalent value of the related exposures the economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country 

our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes the amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities such as fuel oil and gasoline
