regulatory considerations 

our seed and crop protection products and operations are subject to certain approval procedures manufacturing requirements and environmental protection laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we evaluate and test products throughout the research and development phases and each new technology undergoes further rigorous scientific studies and tests to validate that the product can be used effectively and that use of the technology is safe for humans and animals and does not cause undue harm to the environment when used in accordance with the directions for use 

the regulatory approval processes and procedures globally are becoming increasingly more complex which has resulted in additional testing needs difficult to predict and longer approval timelines and higher development and maintenance costs we continue to invest on an ongoing basis to keep dossiers current respond to regulators and meet evolving regulatory standards required by global regulatory frameworks failure to comply with these regulations or future regulatory bans and requirements related to our products and their use may materially impact our financial performance the increase in timelines for regulatory approvals may result in the company not achieving its sustainability targets or its anticipated returns on research and development investments 

regulation of genetically modified organisms “gmos” 

genetically modified seed products are subject to regulatory approval processes and procedures for example in the united states the coordinated framework for regulation of biotechnology governs genetically modified organisms using existing us legislation and legal authorities on food feed and environmental safety plant gmos are regulated by the us department of agriculture’s the “usda” animal and plant health inspection service the “aphis” under the plant protection act the aphis assesses the trait to ensure that the trait will not pose a plant pest and is not a noxious weed gmos in food are regulated by the food and drug administration the “fda” under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the “ffdca” the fda ensures that the food is safe for food and feed pesticides and microorganisms containing gmos are regulated by the environmental protection agency the “epa” pursuant to the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act the “fifra” and the toxic substances control act the epa assesses the trait or the stack containing the traits to ensure that there is no unreasonable adverse effect to the environment 

other countries also have rigorous approval processes procedures and scientific testing requirements for the cultivation or import of genetically modified seed products in the united states and other countries that have functioning regulatory systems a rigorous scientific review is conducted by these agencies to demonstrate that genetically modified products are as safe as traditionally bred nonbiotechgmo counterparts for food feed and the environment various countries in emea latin america and asia have banned gmos entirely 

regulation of crop protection products 

globally manufacturers of crop protection products including herbicides fungicides and insecticides are required to submit an applicationdossier and obtain government regulatory approval prior to selling products in a particular country in the united states the epa is responsible for registering and overseeing the approval and marketing of pesticides pursuant to the fifra the ffdca and the food quality protection act also the usda and the fda monitor levels of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops already registered pesticides are required to be reregistered every 15 years to ensure that those products continue to meet the rigorous safety standards set by the regulators the epa reevaluates pesticide tolerances at least every 10 years taking into account ecological and human health risks in addition to cumulative risks as a result of multiple routes of and sources of exposure 

as of january 2022 before registering any new conventional pesticide active ingredient the epa will evaluate the potential effects on listed species and their designated critical habitats under the endangered species act the “esa” epa also has initiated such evaluations for certain other active ingredients in response to existing or threatened litigation where the epa determines that a pesticide in the registration and reevaluation processes “may affect” a listed species the epa must consult with the us fish and wildlife service and the national marine fisheries service as part of its approval registration and reevaluation processes the epa may impose certain use restrictions on crop protection products under the esa under the citizen suit provisions the esa also includes citizen suit provisions that allow the public to bring suit in court against federal agencies when they believe a listed species is not being adequately protected by the epa 

the companys european operations are subject to the european chemical regulation reach “registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals” and the clp “classification labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures” other jurisdictions also have rigorous approval processes procedures and scientific testing requirements for the approval of crop protection products we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments related to pollution and other environmental health and safety matters 

european farm to fork strategy 

in october 2021 a majority of the european parliament adopted the farm to fork strategy setting forth the european union’s plans to increase organic farming as part of this strategy the eu commission has set aggressive 2030 targets to reduce by 50 the use and risk of chemical pesticides and the use of more hazardous pesticides by 50 additionally as part of this strategy the eu commission is targeting having 25 of the european union’s agricultural land under organic farming by

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our industry 

the successful development and commercialization of cortevas pipeline products will be necessary for cortevas growth 

corteva uses advanced breeding technologies to produce hybrids and varieties with superior performance in farmers’ fields and uses biotechnology to introduce traits that enhance specific characteristics of its crops corteva also uses advanced analytics software tools mobile communications and new planting and monitoring equipment to provide agronomic recommendations to growers additionally corteva conducts research into biological and chemical products to protect farmers’ crops from pests and diseases and enhance plant productivity 

new product concepts may be abandoned for many reasons including greater anticipated development costs technical difficulties lack of efficacy regulatory obstacles or inability to market under regulatory frameworks competition inability to prove the original concept lack of demand and the need to divert focus from time to time to other initiatives with perceived opportunities for better returns the processes of active ingredient development or discovery breeding biotechnology trait discovery and development and trait integration are lengthy and a very small percentage of the chemicals genes and germplasm corteva tests is selected for commercialization furthermore the length of time and the risk associated with the breeding and biotech pipelines are interlinked because both are required as a package for commercial success in markets where biotech traits are approved for growers for example the commercial transition to the company’s enlist e3™ and conkesta e3® soybean technologies which are packaged with its enlist one® and enlist duo® herbicides is expected to take the company several years to complete in countries where biotech traits are not approved for widespread use corteva’s seed sales depend on the quality of its germplasm while initial commercialization efforts have been promising there are no guarantees that anticipated levels of product acceptability within cortevas markets will be achieved or that higher quality products will not be developed by cortevas competitors in the future 

speed in discovering developing protecting and responding to new technologies including new technologybased distribution channels that could facilitate corteva’s ability to engage with customers and end users and bringing related products to market is a significant competitive advantage commercial success frequently depends on being the first company to the market and many of corteva’s competitors are also making considerable investments in similar new biotechnology products improved germplasm products biological and chemical products and agronomic recommendation products 

corteva may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of its products including its seed and crop protection products which could restrict its ability to sell those products in some markets 

regulatory and legislative requirements affect the development manufacture and distribution of corteva’s products including the testing and planting of seeds containing corteva’s biotechnology traits and the import of crops grown from those seeds and noncompliance can harm corteva’s sales and profitability 

seed products incorporating biotechnology derived traits and crop protection products must be extensively tested for safety efficacy and environmental impact before they can be registered for production use sale or commercialization in a given market in certain jurisdictions corteva must periodically renew its approvals for both biotechnology and crop protection products which typically require corteva to demonstrate compliance with thencurrent standards which generally are more stringent since the prior registration the regulatory approvals process is lengthy costly complex and in some markets unpredictable with requirements that can vary by product technology industry and country the regulatory approvals process for products that incorporate novel modes of action or new technologies can be particularly unpredictable and uncertain due to the thencurrent state of regulatory guidelines and objectives as well as governmental policy considerations and non governmental organization and other stakeholder considerations the uncertainty and increased length of regulatory approvals may reduce corteva’s return on its research and development investments and impede its ability to meet sales profitability or sustainability metrics 

furthermore the detection of biotechnology traits or chemical residues from a crop protection product not approved in the country in which corteva sells or cultivates its product or in a country to which corteva imports its product may affect corteva’s ability to supply its products or export its products or even result in crop destruction product recalls or trade disruption which could result in lawsuits and termination of licenses related to biotechnology traits and raw material supply agreements delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to import including those related to the importation of crops grown from

item 1a risk factors continued 

seeds containing certain traits or treated with specific chemicals may influence the rate of adoption of new products in globally traded crops 

additionally the regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of nongovernmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reaction to actual or perceived impacts of new and existing technology products or processes on safety health and the environment obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data which may require participation from technology providers regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing in addition corteva has seen an increase in recent years in the number of lawsuits filed by those who identify themselves as public or environmental interest groups seeking to invalidate pesticide product registrations andor challenge the way federal or state governmental entities apply the rules and regulations governing pesticide produce use the pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance responding to these changes and meeting existing and new requirements may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability the failure to receive necessary permits or approvals could have near and longterm effects on corteva’s ability to produce and sell some current and future products 

the degree of public understanding and acceptance or perceived public acceptance of corteva’s biotechnology and other agricultural products and technologies can affect corteva’s sales and results of operations by affecting planting approvals regulatory requirements and customer purchase decisions 

concerns and claims regarding the safe use of seeds with biotechnology traits and crop protection products in general their potential impact on health and the environment and the perceived impacts of biotechnology on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection these include concerns and claims that increased use of crop protection products drift inversion volatilization and the use of biotechnology traits meant to reduce the resistance of weeds or pests to control by crop protection products could increase or accelerate such resistance and otherwise negatively impact health and the environment these and other concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals preferred purchasing delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals delayed product launches lack of market acceptance product discontinuation continued pressure for and adoption of more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation termination of raw material supply agreements and legal claims these and other concerns could also influence public perceptions the viability or continued sales of certain of corteva’s products corteva’s reputation and the cost to comply with regulations as a result such concerns could have a material adverse effect corteva’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in agricultural and related policies of governments and international organizations may prove unfavorable 

in many markets there are various pressures to reduce government subsidies to farmers which may inhibit the growth in these markets of products used in agriculture in addition government programs that create incentives for farmers may be modified or discontinued however it is difficult to predict accurately whether and if so when such changes will occur corteva expects that the policies of governments and international organizations will continue to affect the planting choices made by growers as well as the income available to growers to purchase products used in agriculture and accordingly the operating results of the agriculture industry 

corteva participates in an industry that is highly competitive and has undergone consolidation which could increase competitive pressures 

corteva currently faces significant competition in the markets in which it operates in most segments of the market the number of products available to the grower is steadily increasing as new products are introduced at the same time certain products are coming off patent and are thus available to generic manufacturers for production and commercialization additionally data analytic tools and webbased new direct purchase models offer increased transparency and comparability which creates price pressures corteva cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of its competitors aggressive marketing or pricing by corteva’s competitors could adversely affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial conditions as a result corteva continues to face significant competitive challenges 

corteva’s business may be materially affected by competition from manufacturers of generic products 

competition from manufacturers of generic products is a challenge for corteva’s branded products around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on corteva’s revenues the date at which 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of corteva’s products or of a product that corteva licenses or upon the “at risk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of corteva’s patented products or of a product that corteva licenses corteva can lose a major portion of revenues for that product which can have a material adverse effect on corteva’s business 

the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations substantial civil or criminal sanctions as well as the assessment of strict liability andor joint and several liability 

corteva is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws regulations rules and ordinances relating to pollution protection of the environment waste water discharges the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials and the use of genetically modified seeds and crop protection active ingredients by growers 

environmental and health and safety laws regulations and standards expose corteva to the risk of substantial costs and liabilities including liabilities associated with corteva’s business and the discontinued and divested businesses and operations of eid as is typical for businesses like corteva’s soil and groundwater contamination has occurred in the past at certain sites and may be identified at other sites in the future disposal of waste from corteva’s business at offsite locations also exposes it to potential remediation costs consistent with past practice corteva is continuing to monitor investigate and remediate soil and groundwater contamination at several of these sites 

costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements moreover changes in environmental regulations including those related to climate change could inhibit or interrupt corteva’s operations or require modifications to its facilities in the future accordingly environmental health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities which may be materially higher than corteva’s accruals 

climate change and unpredictable seasonal and weather factors could impact corteva’s sales and earnings 

the agriculture industry is subject to seasonal and weather factors which can vary unpredictably from period to period weather factors can affect the presence of disease and pests on a regional basis and accordingly can positively or adversely affect the demand for crop protection products including the mix of products used or the level of returns the weather also can affect the quality volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix seed yields can be higher or lower than planned which could lead to higher inventory and related writeoffs climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of extreme weather such as storms floods heat waves droughts and other events that could affect the quality volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix climate change may also affect the availability and suitability of arable land and contribute to unpredictable shifts in the average growing season and types of crops produced 

corteva’s business is subject to various competition and antitrust rules and regulations around the world and as the size of its business grows scrutiny of its business by legislators and regulators in these areas may intensify 

on july 9 2021 president biden issued an executive order promoting competition in the american economy the order encouraged further examination and efforts by us regulatory agencies to avoid market concentrations for agricultural inputs that could challenge the survival of family farms the executive order also directs the us secretary of agriculture to take action to ensure that the intellectual property system while still incentivizing innovation does not also unnecessarily reduce competition in seed and other agricultural input markets beyond what is reasonably contemplated by the us patent act and propose strategies for addressing those concerns across intellectual property antitrust and other relevant laws while the ultimate impact of the executive order will depend on the actions ultimately resulting from the us regulatory authorities actions taken by such authorities may increase the regulation and regulatory costs associated with the agriculture industry in the future and restrict the company from pursuing certain growth opportunities including mergers and acquisitions 

scrutiny from regulators in the us and abroad may intensify as corteva’s business presence grows this scrutiny and related investigations even when not resulting in an enforcement action may result in damage to a company’s reputation significant

item 1a risk factors continued 

defense expense as well as become a distraction to management antitrust and competition enforcement actions may result in regulators imposing fines penalties or restrictions on a company’s business practices in a manner that may significantly impact its results of operations 

corteva’s sales to its customers may be adversely affected should a company successfully establish an intermediary platform for the sale of corteva’s products or otherwise position itself between corteva and its customers 

corteva services customers primarily through the pioneer direct sales channel in key agricultural geographies including the united states in addition corteva supplements this approach with strong retail channels including distributors agricultural cooperatives and dealers and with digital solutions that assist farmer decisionmaking with a view to optimize their product selection and maximize their yield and profitability while corteva expects the indirect channels and its digital platform will extend its reach and increase exposure of its products to other potential customers including smaller farmers or farmers in less concentrated areas there can be no assurance that corteva will be successful in this regard if a competitor were to successfully establish an intermediary platform for distribution of corteva’s products especially with respect to corteva’s digital platform it may disrupt corteva’s distribution model and inhibit corteva’s ability to provide a complete gotomarket strategy covering the direct dealer and retail channels in such a circumstance corteva’s sales may be adversely affected 

risks related to our operations 

corteva is dependent on its relationships or contracts with third parties with respect to certain of its raw materials or licenses and commercialization 

corteva is dependent on third parties in the research development and commercialization of its products and enters into transactions including but not limited to supply agreements and licensing agreements in connection with corteva’s business the majority of corteva’s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits that corteva licenses from third parties under longterm licenses if corteva loses its rights under such licenses it could negatively impact corteva’s ability to obtain future licenses on competitive terms commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products to maintain such licenses corteva may elect to outlicense its technology including germplasm there can be no guarantee that such outlicensing will not ultimately strengthen corteva’s competition thereby adversely impacting corteva’s results of operations 

while corteva relies heavily on third parties for multiple aspects of its business and commercialization activities corteva does not control many aspects of such third parties’ activities third parties may not complete activities on schedule or in accordance with corteva’s expectations failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual or other obligations to corteva or to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any disruption in the relationship between corteva and one or more of these third parties could delay or prevent the development approval or commercialization of corteva’s products and could also result in noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for corteva’s business 

in addition corteva’s agreements with third parties may obligate it to meet certain contractual or other obligations to third parties for example corteva may be obligated to meet certain thresholds or abide by certain boundary conditions if corteva were to fail to meet such obligations to the third parties its relationship with such third parties may be disrupted such a disruption could negatively impact certain of corteva’s licenses on which it depends could cause reputational harm and could negatively affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by industrial espionage and other disruptions to its supply chain information technology or network systems 

business andor supply chain disruptions plant andor power outages and information technology system andor network disruptions regardless of cause including acts of sabotage employee error or other actions geopolitical activity military conflict local epidemics or pandemics weather events and natural disasters could seriously harm corteva’s operations as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers for example a pandemic in locations where corteva has significant operations sales or key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on corteva’s results of operations in addition terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased stakeholder concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution 

business andor supply chain disruptions may also be caused by security breaches which could include for example ransomware attacks and attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers viruses breaches due to employee 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

error or actions or other disruptions corteva andor its suppliers may fail to effectively prevent detect and recover from these or other security breaches and as a consequence such breaches could result in misuse of corteva’s assets business disruptions loss of property including trade secrets and confidential business information legal claims or proceedings reporting errors processing inefficiencies negative media attention loss of sales and interference with regulatory and data privacy compliance 

like most major corporations corteva is the target of industrial espionage including cyberattacks from time to time corteva has determined that these incidents have resulted and could result in the future in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information however to date corteva has not experienced any material financial impact changes in the competitive environment or impact on business operations from these events although management does not believe that corteva has experienced any material losses to date related to industrial espionage and security breaches including cybersecurity incidents there can be no assurance that corteva will not suffer such losses in the future 

corteva actively manages the risks within its control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches as these threats continue to evolve particularly around cybersecurity corteva may be required to expend significant resources to enhance its control environment processes practices and other protective measures despite these efforts such events could also have a material adverse effect on corteva’s business financial condition results of operations and reputation additionally any losses from such an event may be excluded from or in excess of the coverages provided by cortevas insurance policies 

volatility in corteva’s input costs which include raw materials and production costs could have a significant impact on corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

corteva’s input costs are variable based on the costs associated with production or with raw materials corteva uses for example corteva’s production costs vary especially on a seasonal basis where changes in weather influence supply and demand in addition corteva’s manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of raw materials the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond corteva’s control corteva refers to these costs collectively as input costs significant variations in input costs affect corteva’s operating results from period to period 

when possible corteva purchases raw materials through negotiated longterm contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations corteva also enters into overthecounter and exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases in addition corteva takes actions to offset the effects of higher input costs through selling price increases productivity improvements and cost reduction programs success in offsetting higher input costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served if corteva is not able to fully offset the effects of higher input costs it could have a significant impact on its financial results 

corteva’s liquidity business results of operations and financial condition could be impaired if it is unable to raise capital through the capital markets or shortterm debt borrowings 

any limitation on corteva’s ability to raise money in the capital markets or through shortterm debt borrowings could have a substantial negative effect on corteva’s liquidity corteva’s ability to affordably access the capital markets andor borrow short term debt in amounts adequate to finance its activities could be impaired as a result of a variety of factors including factors that are not specific to corteva such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and in the case of debt securities or borrowings interest rate fluctuations due to the seasonality of corteva’s business and the credit programs corteva may offer its customers net working capital investment and corresponding debt levels will fluctuate over the course of the year 

corteva regularly extends credit to its customers to enable them to purchase seeds or crop protection products at the beginning of the growing season the customer receivables may be used as collateral for shortterm financing programs any material adverse effect upon corteva’s ability to own or sell such customer receivables including seasonal factors that may impact the amount of customer receivables corteva owns may materially impact corteva’s access to capital 

corteva has additional agreements with financial institutions to establish programs that provide financing for select customers of corteva’s seed and crop protection products in the united states latin america europe and asia the programs are renewed on an annual basis in most cases corteva guarantees the extension of such credit to such customers if corteva is unable to renew these agreements or access the debt markets to support customer financing corteva’s sales may be negatively impacted which could result in increased borrowing needs to fund working capital 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

corteva’s earnings operations and business among other things will impact its credit ratings costs and availability of financing there can be no assurance that corteva or eid will maintain its current or prospective credit ratings a decrease in the ratings assigned to corteva or eid by the ratings agencies may negatively impact corteva’s liquidity access to the debt capital markets and increase corteva’s cost of borrowing and the financing of its seasonal working capital 

corteva’s customers may be unable to pay their debts to corteva which could adversely affect corteva’s results 

corteva offers its customers financing programs with credit terms generally less than one year from invoicing in alignment with the growing season due to these credit practices as well as the seasonality of corteva’s operations corteva may need to issue shortterm debt at certain times of the year to fund its cash flow requirements corteva’s customers may be exposed to a variety of conditions that could adversely affect their ability to pay their debts for example customers in economies experiencing an economic downturn or in a region experiencing adverse growing conditions may be unable to repay their obligations to corteva which could adversely affect corteva’s results 

increases in pension and other postemployment benefit plan funding obligations may adversely affect corteva’s results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

through cortevas ownership of eid corteva maintains eid defined benefit pension and other postemployment benefit plans for some of these plans including eid’s principal us pension plan corteva continues as sponsor for the entire plan regardless of whether participants including retirees are or were associated with eid’s agriculture business corteva uses many assumptions in calculating its expected future payment obligations under these plans significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than assumed in addition expected future payment obligations may be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions regarding participants including retirees in 2022 corteva expects to contribute approximately 60 million to its pension plans other than the principal us pension plan and about 140 million for its other postemployment benefit opeb plans while not anticipated for 2022 corteva may make potential discretionary contributions to the principal us pension plan corteva furthermore may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future which could adversely affect corteva’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by environmental litigation and other commitments and contingencies 

as a result of corteva’s operations including past operations and those related to divested businesses and discontinued operations of eid corteva incurs environmental operating costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits corteva also incurs environmental operating costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials in addition corteva maintains and periodically reviews and adjusts its accruals for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs 

corteva expects to continue to incur environmental operating costs since it will operate global manufacturing product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations these rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency which corteva monitors closely corteva’s policy requires that its operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements in addition corteva expects to continue certain voluntary programs and could consider additional voluntary actions to reduce air emissions minimize the generation of hazardous waste decrease the volume of water use and discharges increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent bioaccumulative and toxic materials costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs and goals are significant and corteva expects these costs will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future over the long term such expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and could fluctuate significantly 

corteva accrues for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs corteva expects to base such estimates on several factors including the complexity of the geology the nature and extent of contamination the type of remedy the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties “prps” at multiparty sites and the number of and financial 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

viability of other prps considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and under adverse changes in circumstances the potential liability may be materially higher than corteva’s accruals 

corteva faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters arising out of the normal course of its current and former business operations including intellectual property commercial product liability environmental and antitrust lawsuits corteva has noted a trend in public and private suits being filed on behalf of states counties cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public and the environment including waterways and watersheds claims alleging harm to the public and the environment may be brought against corteva notwithstanding years of scientific evidence and regulatory determinations supporting the safety of crop protection products the litigation involving monsanto’s roundup ® nonselective glyphosate containing weedkiller products has resulted in negative publicity and sentiment and may lead to similar suits with respect to glyphosatecontaining products andor other established crop protection products claims and allegations that corteva’s products or products that corteva manufactures or markets on behalf of third parties are not safe could result in litigation damage to corteva’s reputation and have a material adverse effect on corteva’s business it is not possible to predict the outcome of these various proceedings and any potential impact on corteva an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters may result in losses not fully covered by cortevas insurance policies and could be material to cortevas financial results various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such factors and developments may include but are not limited to additional data safety or risk assessments as well as a final adverse judgment significant settlement or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on corteva 

the company pursuant to the respective separation agreements is entitled to cost sharing and indemnification from chemours dow and dupont as applicable for certain litigation environmental workers’ compensation and other liabilities related to its historical operations in connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters corteva records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable these estimates of recovery are subject to various factors and developments that could result in differences from future estimates or the actual recovery as of december 31 2021 the indemnification assets pursuant to the chemours separation agreement and the corteva separation agreement are in aggregate 72 million within accounts and notes receivable  net and 254 million within other assets in the company’s consolidated balance sheet any failure by or inability to pay these liabilities in line with the indemnification provisions of the separation agreements may have a material adverse effect on corteva and its financial condition and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of business corteva may make certain commitments including representations warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations including those related to divested businesses and issue guarantees of thirdparty obligations if corteva were required to make payments as a result they could exceed the amounts accrued thereby adversely affecting corteva’s financial condition and results of operations 

corteva’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks and restrictions which could negatively affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

corteva’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks and restrictions including fluctuations in foreigncurrency exchange rates inflation exchange and price control regulations corruption risks competitive restrictions changes in local political or economic conditions import and trade restrictions import or export licensing requirements and trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad in addition corteva’s international operations are sometimes in countries with unstable governments economic or fiscal challenges military or political conflicts local epidemics or pandemics significant levels of crime and organized crime or developing legal systems this may increase the risk to the companys employees subcontractors or other parties and to other liabilities such as property loss or damage to the companys products and may affect cortevas ability to safely operate in or import into or receive raw materials from these countries 

additionally corteva’s ability to export its products and its sales outside the united states has been and may continue to be adversely affected by significant changes in trade tax or other policies including the risk that other countries may retaliate through the imposition of their own trade restrictions andor increased tariffs in response to substantial changes to us trade and tax policies 

although corteva has operations throughout the world corteva’s sales outside the united states in 2021 were principally to customers in brazil eurozone countries and canada further corteva’s largest currency exposures are the brazilian real swiss franc european euro eur and canadian dollar inflation market uncertainty or an economic downturn in these 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

geographic areas could reduce demand for corteva’s products and result in decreased sales volume which could have a negative impact on corteva’s results of operations in addition changes in exchange rates may affect corteva’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods corteva actively manages currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions and committed purchases 

failure to effectively manage acquisitions divestitures alliances restructurings cost savings initiatives and other portfolio actions may not have the results anticipated 

from time to time corteva evaluates acquisition candidates that may strategically fit corteva’s business andor growth objectives if corteva is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses corteva could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increases in revenues and operating results which could have a material adverse effect on corteva’s financial results corteva continually reviews its portfolio of assets for contributions to its objectives and alignment with its growth strategy however corteva may not be successful in separating underperforming or nonstrategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of or lost operating income from such assets may affect corteva’s earnings moreover corteva might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce its earnings in addition if the execution of these transactions initiatives or portfolio actions is not successful it could adversely impact corteva’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

sentiment towards climate change and other environmental social and governance “esg” matters could adversely affect our stock price results of operations and access to capital 

since 2020 corteva has announced sustainability goals including adopting its greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy and targets for 2030 and inclusion diversity and equity goals for 2026 execution of these strategies and the achievements of corteva’s sustainability goals is subject to risk and uncertainties many of which are out of its control failure to achieve its sustainability goals within the currently projected costs and expected timeframes could damage corteva’s reputation customer and investor relationships or its access to financing further given investors increased focus related to esg matters such a failure could cause stockholders to reduce their ownership holdings all of which in turn could adversely affect corteva’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and reduce its stock price 

global or regional health pandemics or epidemics including covid19 could negatively impact the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

cortevas business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics the severity magnitude and duration of the current covid19 pandemic and future outbreaks is uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict to date the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted foreign currency exchange rates as a result of a generally stronger us dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which the company operates which has adversely affected the companys reported results of operations these relative differences could widen and further adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition increased market volatility resulting from covid19 disruptions has also limited the availability of certain manufacturing inputs current and future covid19 outbreaks and resulting illness travel restrictions and workforce disruptions could impact cortevas global supply chain its operations and its routes to market or those of its suppliers comanufacturers or customersdistributors these disruptions or the companys failure to effectively respond to them could increase product or distribution costs alter the timing of recognizing manufacturing costs or impact the delivery of products to customers 

covid19 and the related governmentimposed restrictions including stay at home orders has significantly impacted other economic activity and markets around the world future outbreaks or pandemics could negatively impact the companys business financial condition and results of operations in numerous ways including but not limited to those outlined below 

• government or regulatory responses to pandemics could negatively impact the companys business mandatory lockdowns or other restrictions on operations in certain countries have temporarily disrupted the companys ability to operate or distribute its products in these markets continuation or expansion of these disruptions could materially adversely impact the companys operations and results 

• reductions to the company’s forecasted profitability and continued global economic decline could trigger potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

• the instability or unavailability of a farm workforce to harvest agricultural products could impact the companys customers’ ability to monetize their crop and potentially impact the collection of the companys customer receivables 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

• continued commodity cost volatility is expected and the companys commodity hedging activities may not sufficiently offset this volatility depressed commodity prices may increase the insolvency risk of cortevas customers in the longerterm along with reducing the demand for cortevas products 

• disruptions or uncertainties related to the covid19 outbreak for a sustained period of time could result in delays or modifications to the companys strategic plans and productivity initiatives 

• increased volatility and pricing in the capital and commercial paper markets may reoccur and impact the companys access to preferred sources of liquidity resulting in higher borrowing costs the company cannot assure investors that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms 

• increased market volatility may bring unprecedented market conditions making it difficult for the company to adequately forecast customer demand or price its products 

therefore the result of the company’s consolidated results of operations in face of the ongoing covid19 outbreak or another pandemic and the unprecedented economic conditions which can result therefrom may negatively impact the companys business operations financial performance and results of operations in the future 

if we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel our business may be harmed 

much of corteva’s future success depends on the continued service availability and performance of our senior management and highlyskilled personnel across all levels of the organization corteva’s senior management has acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to its business and the loss of any of these individuals could harm its business especially if we are not successful in developing adequate succession plans our efforts to attract develop integrate and retain highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications may be compounded by difficulties in recruiting hiring and retaining urgently needed specialized employees at a regional level where there may be significant competition between employers if we are unable to continue to successfully attract retain and develop key personnel our business may be harmed 

risks related to our intellectual property 

enforcing corteva’s intellectual property rights or defending against intellectual property claims asserted by others could materially affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

intellectual property rights including patents plant variety protection trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and other forms of trade dress are important to corteva’s business corteva endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported however corteva may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual property in key jurisdictions further changes in government policies and regulations including changes made in reaction to pressure from nongovernmental organizations or the public generally could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions 

corteva has designed and implemented internal controls to restrict use of access to and distribution of its intellectual property despite these precautions corteva’s intellectual property is vulnerable to infringement misappropriation and other unauthorized access including through employee or licensee error or actions theft and cybersecurity incidents and other security breaches when unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered corteva reports such situations to governmental authorities for investigation as appropriate and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be selfreplicating 

competitors are increasingly challenging intellectual property positions and the outcomes can be highly uncertain third parties may claim corteva’s products violate their intellectual property rights defending such claims even those without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive in addition any such claim could result in corteva’s having to enter into license agreements develop noninfringing products or engage in litigation that could be costly if challenges are resolved adversely it could negatively impact corteva’s ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms develop and commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products 

in addition because of the rapid pace of technological change the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions andor the uncertainty in predicting the outcome of complex proceedings relating to ownership and the scope of patents relating to certain emerging technologies competitors may be issued patents related to corteva’s business unexpectedly these patents could reduce the value of corteva’s commercial or pipeline products or to the extent they cover key technologies on which 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

corteva has relied require corteva to seek to obtain licenses and corteva cannot ensure it would be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or cease using the technology no matter how valuable to corteva’s business 

legislation and jurisprudence on patent protection is evolving and changes in laws could affect corteva’s ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for and otherwise enforce corteva’s patents related to its products 

corteva’s business may be adversely affected by the availability of counterfeit products 

a counterfeit product is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit corteva product therefore is one manufactured by someone other than corteva but which appears to be the same as an authentic corteva product the prevalence of counterfeit products is a significant and growing industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit products can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual consumers the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit products and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters compared to the large profits that can be earned by them from the sale of counterfeit products further laws against counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing laws varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some countries counterfeiting is not a crime in others it may result in only minimal sanctions in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit products use complex transport routes to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products 

corteva’s global reputation makes its products prime targets for counterfeiting organizations counterfeit products pose a risk to consumer health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit products which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain could adversely impact corteva’s business by among other things causing the loss of consumer confidence in corteva’s name and in the integrity of its products potentially resulting in lost sales and an increased threat of litigation 

corteva undertakes significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit products including among other things working with regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of products and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy corteva’s products and easier for consumers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit products working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit products working collaboratively with wholesalers customs offices and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors and working with other members of an international trade association of agrochemical companies to promote initiatives to combat counterfeiting activity no assurance can be given however that corteva’s efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit products may continue to increase 

restrictions under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements limit corteva’s ability to develop and commercialize certain products and services andor prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property 

the company is dependent to a certain extent on dupont and dow to maintain and enforce certain of the intellectual property licensed under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements for example dupont and dow are responsible for filing prosecuting and maintaining at their respective discretion patents on trade secrets and knowhow that they each respectively license to corteva they also have the first right to enforce their respective trade secrets and knowhow licensed to corteva if dupont or dow as applicable fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents trade secrets or knowhow under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements the company may not be able to prevent competitors from making using and selling competitive products and services 

in addition corteva’s use of the intellectual property licensed to it under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements is restricted to certain fields which could limit corteva’s ability to develop and commercialize certain products and services for example the licenses granted to corteva under the agreement will not extend to all fields of use that the company may decide to enter into in the future these restrictions may make it more difficult time consuming andor expensive for corteva to develop and commercialize certain new products and services or may result in certain of its products or services being later to market than those of its competitors

risks related to the separation 

in connection with the separation the company has assumed and agreed to indemnify dupont and dow for certain liabilities if the company is required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities the company may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and its financial results could be negatively impacted in addition dupont and dow will indemnify corteva for certain liabilities these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities it incurs and dupont andor dow andor their historical separated businesses may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation agreement the employee matters agreement and the tax matters agreement with dupont and dow the company agreed to assume and indemnify dupont and dow for certain liabilities for uncapped amounts which may include among other items associated defense costs settlement amounts and judgments as discussed further in note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements and part i  item 3  legal proceedings payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact the company’s business particularly indemnities relating to certain litigation for historical dupont operations or its actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the corteva distribution third parties could also seek to hold the company responsible for any of the liabilities allocated to dupont and dow including those related to dowdupont’s specialty products andor materials science businesses respectively and those related to discontinued andor divested businesses and operations of historical dow which have been allocated to dow dupont andor dow as applicable will agree to indemnify corteva for such liabilities but such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect the company against the full amount of such liabilities in addition dupont andor dow as applicable may not be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations with respect to the liabilities the company incurs even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from dupont andor dow as applicable any amounts for which the company is held liable the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself each of these risks could negatively affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally the company generally has assumed and is responsible for the payment of its share of i certain liabilities of dowdupont relating to arising out of or resulting from certain general corporate matters of dowdupont ii certain liabilities of historical dupont relating to arising out of or resulting from general corporate matters of historical dupont and discontinued andor divested businesses and operations of historical dupont including its spinoff of chemours and iii certain separation expenses not otherwise allocated to dupont or dow or allocated specifically to corteva pursuant to the corteva separation agreement and third parties could seek to hold corteva responsible for dupont’s or dow’s share of any such liabilities for more information see note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements and part i  item 3  legal proceedings dupont andor dow as applicable will indemnify corteva for their share of any such liabilities however such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect corteva against the full amount of such liabilities andor dupont andor dow may not be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in addition even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from dupont andor dow any amounts for which the company is held liable in excess of its agreed share the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself and may not be able to fully insure itself to cover these risks each of these risks could materially affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the separation and related transactions may expose corteva to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws 

although the company received a solvency opinion from an investment bank confirming that the company and dupont were each adequately capitalized following the distribution the separation could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws in connection with fraudulent conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent or that rendered the debtor insolvent inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due any unpaid creditor could claim that dupont did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the separation and corteva distribution and that the separation and corteva distribution left dupont insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that dupont intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured additionally under its indemnity provisions of the separation agreement the company could find its liabilities increased as a result of a court concluding that historical dupont historical dow or dowdupont executed a fraudulent conveyance in connection with divestitures and spinoffs of any one of their historical operations including chemours if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff then such court could void the separation and distribution as a fraudulent transfer or impose substantial liabilities on corteva which could materially

item 1a risk factors continued 

adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations among other things the court could return some of corteva’s assets or shares of corteva common stock to dupont provide dupont with a claim for money damages against corteva in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by dupont and the fair market value of corteva at the time of the corteva distribution or require corteva to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the internal reorganization and business realignment for the benefit of creditors 

the distribution is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes under the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either i out of its surplus net assets minus capital or ii if there is no such surplus out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year although the distribution was made out of dowdupont’s surplus and the company received an opinion that dowdupont has adequate surplus under delaware law to declare the dividend of corteva common stock in connection with the corteva distribution there can be no assurance that a court will not later determine that some or all of the corteva distribution was unlawful 

if the corteva distribution together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes then the company could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability and stockholders receiving corteva common stock in the corteva distribution could be subject to significant tax liability 

dowdupont received an irs tax ruling and tax opinion that among other things the corteva distribution and certain related transactions will qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 and section 368a1d of the internal revenue code the code the irs ruling and tax opinion relied on certain facts assumptions and undertakings and certain representations from dowdupont and corteva regarding the past and future conduct of both respective businesses and other matters despite the tax opinion and the irs ruling the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion 

if the corteva distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable then a stockholder of dupont that received shares of corteva common stock would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares including any fractional shares sold on behalf of such stockholder on the distribution date and could incur significant income tax liabilities such distribution would be taxable to such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of dupont’s current and accumulated earnings and profits which would include any earnings and profits attributable to the gain recognized by dupont on the taxable distribution and could include earnings and profits attributable to certain internal transactions preceding the corteva distribution any amount that exceeded dupont’s earnings and profits would be treated first as a non taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in its shares of dupont stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a gain on the dupont stock in the event the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable dupont would recognize corporate level taxable gain on the distribution in an amount equal to the excess if any of the fair market value of corteva common stock distributed to dupont stockholders on the distribution date over dupont’s tax basis in such stock in addition if certain related transactions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state local tax andor foreign tax law corteva and dupont could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law 

generally taxes resulting from the failure of the separation and distributions to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes would be imposed on dupont or dupont stockholders under the tax matters agreement that the company entered into with dupont and dow subject to the exceptions described below the company is generally obligated to indemnify dupont against such taxes imposed on dupont however if the distributions fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the merger and the distributions then under the tax matters agreement dupont and dow would share the tax liability resulting from such failure in accordance with their relative equity values on the first full trading day following the dow distribution the company and dupont would share any liabilities of dupont described in the preceding sentence in accordance with its relative equity values on the first full trading day following the corteva distribution furthermore under the terms of the tax matters agreement the company also generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on dupont or dow that arise from the failure of the corteva distribution to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to its or its affiliates’ stock assets or business or any breach of its representations made in any representation letter provided to its counsel in connection with the tax opinion dupont and dow will be separately

responsible for any taxes imposed on corteva that arise from the failure of the corteva distribution to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to such company’s or its affiliates’ stock assets or business or any breach of such company’s representations made in connection with the irs ruling or in the representation letter provided to counsel in connection with the tax opinion events triggering an indemnification obligation under the tax matters agreement include events occurring after the corteva distribution that cause dupont to recognize a gain under section 355e of the code as discussed further below such tax amounts could be significant to the extent that the company is responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on corteva’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

the irs may assert that the merger causes the distributions and other related transactions to be taxable to dupont in which case the company could be subject to significant indemnification liability 

even if the distributions otherwise constitutes a taxfree transaction to stockholders under section 355 of the code dupont may be required to recognize corporate level tax on the distributions and certain related transactions under section 355e of the code if as a result of the merger or other transactions considered part of a plan with the distributions there is a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in dupont or corteva in connection with the merger dowdupont received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the proper time manner and methodology for measuring common ownership in the stock of dowdupont historical dupont and historical dow for purposes of determining whether there has been a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under section 355e of the code as a result of the merger the tax opinion relied on the continued validity of the private letter ruling as well as certain factual representations from dowdupont as to the extent of common ownership in the stock of historical dupont and historical dow immediately prior to the merger based on the representations made by dowdupont as to the common ownership in the stock of historical dupont and historical dow immediately prior to the merger and assuming the continued validity of the irs ruling the tax opinion concluded that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in dowdupont historical dupont or historical dow for purposes of section 355e as a result of the merger notwithstanding the tax opinion and the irs ruling the irs could determine that the distributions or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to dupont if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations or undertakings of dowdupont is not correct or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling if dupont is required to recognize corporate level tax on either of the distributions and certain related transactions under section 355e of the code then under the tax matters agreement the company may be required to indemnify dupont andor dow for all or a portion of such taxes which could be a material amount if such taxes were the result of either direct or indirect transfers of corteva common stock or certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the merger and the distributions 

the company is subject to continuing contingent taxrelated liabilities of dowdupont following the distribution 

there are several significant areas where the liabilities of dowdupont may become corteva’s obligations either in whole or in part for example under the code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of dowdupont’s consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for such taxable period additionally to the extent that any subsidiary of corteva was included in the consolidated tax reporting group of either historical dupont or historical dow for any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the merger such subsidiary is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group of historical dupont or historical dow as applicable for such taxable period in connection with the distributions on april 1 2019 the company entered into the tax matters agreement with dupont and dow that allocates the responsibility for prior period consolidated taxes among corteva dupont and dow if dupont or dow were unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible however the company could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes and such amounts could be significant other provisions of federal state local or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities

critical accounting estimates 

the companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the companys operating results and financial condition 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported

amounts including but not limited to receivable and inventory valuations impairment of tangible and intangible assets longterm employee benefit obligations income taxes environmental matters and litigation managements estimates are based on historical experience facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable the company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the companys accounting policies which could have a material effect on the companys financial position liquidity or results of operations 

pension plans and other post employment benefits 

accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the companys pension and opeb plans management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are remeasured these and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate as permitted by gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive 

substantially all of the companys benefit obligation for pensions and opeb are attributable to the benefit plans in the us in the us the single equivalent discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixedincome instruments provided by the plans actuaries as of the measurement date the company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for nonus benefit plans historically the company utilized prevailing longterm high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate applicable to each country at the measurement date the weighted average discount rates used in developing the 2022 net periodic pension and opeb costs are expected to be 282 percent and 259 percent respectively 

within the us the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries where appropriate assetliability studies are also taken into consideration the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in the us is based upon historical real returns net of inflation for the asset classes covered by the investment policy expected performance and projections of inflation and interest rates over the longterm period during which benefits are payable to plan participants in determining the 2021 net periodic pension cost in the us 575 percent of expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption was used after reevaluating the current strategic asset allocation and recent market conditions the company lowered the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption to 450 percent to be used in determining the 2022 net periodic pension cost in the us consistent with prior years the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in the us reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the companys active management of the plans assets 

i n determining annual expense for the principal us pension plan the company uses a marketrelated value of assets rather than its fair value accordingly there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation as a result changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the companys calculation of net periodic pension cost for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the marketrelated value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months however as a result of the merger the marketrelated value of assets was calculated by averaging market returns from september 1 2017 through the year ended december 31 2019 

the following table shows the marketrelated value and fair value of plan assets for the principal us pension plan 



for plans other than the principal us pension plan pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets

accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated at december 31 2021 the company had accrued obligations of 452 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs including 68 million for the remediation of superfund sites as remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs the companys estimates are based on a number of factors including the complexity of the geology the nature and extent of contamination the type of remedy the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties prps at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other prps therefore considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs and under adverse changes in circumstances it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to 592 million above that amount consequently it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows it is the opinion of the company’s management however that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition or cash flows for further discussion see environmental matters in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

the companys results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company including product liability claims patent infringement and antitrust claims and claims for thirdparty property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts the company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations settlements rulings advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters management considers many factors these factors include but are not limited to the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims the companys experience with similar types of claims the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed input from outside legal counsel the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matters current status considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding in such situations the company will not recognize a loss if based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements 

indemnification assets 

the company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities by dupont dow and chemours the term of this indemnification is generally indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses as well as monetary and nonmonetary settlements and judgments in connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable in assessing the probability of recovery the company considers the contractual rights under the separation agreements and any potential credit risk future events such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of dupont dow and  or chemours could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded the company evaluates the recovery of the

indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable see note 5  divestitures and other transactions and note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to indemnifications 

income taxes 

the breadth of the companys operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in the normal course of business the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the companys tax assets and tax liabilities it is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant however due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made 

deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the companys assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies for example changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period in some situations these changes could be material see note 10  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

at december 31 2021 the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of 782 million inclusive of a valuation allowance of 366 million realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time as a result changes in tax laws assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets see note 10  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance 

valuation of assets and impairment considerations 

the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in the companys valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates royalty rates and discount rates although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill other intangible assets property plant and equipment investments in nonconsolidated affiliates and other assets is an integral part of the companys normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects managements best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environment in which the companys segments operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices market growth and inflation rates can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized in addition the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the companys growth strategy strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets such an assessment could result in impairment losses 

the company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment one level below the operating segment or component is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management 

part ii 

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities the company’s reporting units include seed crop protection and digital 

for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed at the company level include but are not limited to gdp growth rates longterm commodity prices equity and credit market activity discount rates foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include but are not limited to changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and new product launches cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting unit if the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value additional quantitative testing is required 

if additional quantitative testing is required the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge if any is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value limited to the amount of goodwill associated with the reporting unit the company determines fair values for each of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model a form of the income approach utilizing level 3 unobservable inputs or the market approach 

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate the company’s significant assumptions in these analyses include future cash flow projections weighted average cost of capital the terminal growth rate and the tax rate the company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates recent operating results and planned business strategy and includes an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on its most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts the company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzes published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing the company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts discount rates used in the company’s valuations ranged from 925 percent to 165 percent under the market approach the company uses metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions for comparable companies 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods the company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate based on the goodwill impairment analyses performed in the fourth quarter 2021 the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 20 percent and no goodwill impairment charge was necessary 

prepaid royalties 

the company’s seed segment currently has certain thirdparty biotechnology trait license agreements which require upfront and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions these payments are reflected as other current assets and other assets and are amortized to cost of goods sold as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the term of the license the rate of royalty amortization expense recognized is based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio market dynamics farmer preferences growth rates and projected planted acres changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology could impact the rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty 

at december 31 2021 the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in other current assets and other assets was 303 million and 256 million respectively the majority of the balance of prepaid royalties relates to the company’s wholly owned subsidiary pioneer hibred international inc’s “pioneer” nonexclusive license in the united states and canada for the monsanto companys genuity ® roundup ready 2 yield ® glyphosate tolerance trait and roundup ready 2 xtend ® glyphosate and dicamba tolerance trait for soybeans “roundup ready 2 license agreement” the prepaid royalty asset relates to a series of upfront fixed and variable royalty payments to utilize the traits in pioneer’s soybean product mix the company’s historical expectation has been that the technology licensed under the roundup ready 2 license agreement would be used as the primary herbicide tolerance trait platform in the pioneer ® brand soybean through the term of the agreement das and ms technologies

llc jointly developed and own the enlist e3 tm herbicide tolerance trait for soybeans which provides tolerance to 2 4d choline in enlist duo ® and enlist one ® herbicides as well as glyphosate and glufosinate herbicides in connection with the validation of breeding plans and largescale product development timelines during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company accelerated the ramp up of the enlist e3 tm trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands including pioneer ® brands over the subsequent five years during the rampup period the company is expected to significantly reduce the volume of products with the roundup ready 2 yield ® and roundup ready 2 xtend ® herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021 with expected minimal use of the trait platform thereafter for the remainder of the roundup ready 2 license agreement the “transition plan” the rate of royalty expense is therefore expected to significantly increase through higher amortization of the prepaid royalty as fewer seeds containing the respective trait are expected to be utilized 

in connection with the departure from these traits in the companys product portfolio beginning january 1 2020 the company presents and discloses the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a component of restructuring and asset related charges  net in the consolidated statement of operations the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense represents the difference between the rate of amortization based on the revised number of units expected to contain the roundup ready 2 yield ® and roundup ready 2 xtend ® trait technology and the per unit cash rate per the roundup ready 2 license agreement for the year ended december 31 2021 the company recognized 125 million in restructuring and asset related charges  net in the consolidated statement of operations from noncash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense the expected noncash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense estimated for 2022 is approximately 102 million aggregating to approximately 235 million over the next 3 years 

further changes in factors and assumptions associated with usage of the trait platform licensed under the roundup ready 2 license agreement including the transition plan could further impact the rate of recognition of the prepaid royalty and statement of operations presentation of the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense

the company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy the contractual obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business 

longterm employee benefits 

the company has various obligations to its employees and retirees the company maintains retirementrelated programs in many countries that have a longterm impact on the companys earnings and cash flows these plans are typically defined benefit pension plans as well as medical dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees other post employment benefits or opeb substantially all of the companys worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the companys worldwide opeb obligations are attributable to the us benefit plans 

pension coverage for employees of the companys nonus consolidated subsidiaries is provided to the extent deemed appropriate through separate plans the company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics life expectancy and countryspecific pension funding rules change where permitted by applicable law the company reserves the right to change modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension medical dental life insurance and disability benefits 

benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement in november 2016 the company announced changes to the us pension and opeb plans the company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the us pension plans on november 30 2018 resulting in the participants no longer accruing additional benefits in addition to the changes to the us pension plans opeb eligible employees who were under the age of 50 as of november 30 2018 will not receive postretirement medical dental and life insurance benefits the majority of employees hired in the us on or after january 1 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and postretirement medical dental and life insurance plans but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans 

in september 2021 the company transferred approximately 250 million of certain benefit obligations and related assets associated with the principal us pension plan to an insurance company through the purchase of nonparticipating group annuity contracts the company may consider additional annuity purchases in the future 

in december 2020 the company amended its retiree medical dental and life insurance plans resulting in the company no longer providing retiree dental and life insurance benefits effective january 1 2022 and corteva’s portion of the cost of nonmedicare retiree medical coverage no longer being adjusted for cost increases which capped the corteva cost at the level as of december 31 2021 2020 opeb plan amendments as a result of these changes the company recorded a 939 million decrease in opeb benefit obligations as of december 31 2020 with a corresponding prior service benefit within other comprehensive income loss for the year ended december 31 2020 during 2021 a substantial amount of the prior service benefit within other comprehensive income loss in 2020 was recognized in other income  net in the consolidated statement of operations 

pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits the company did not make contributions to the principal us pension plan for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 or 2019 funding for each pension plan other than the principal us pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates thus there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense in general however improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs the company contributed 8 million 9 million and 39 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal us pension plan for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

us pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows the companys remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows the company made benefit payments of 41 million 53 million and 82 million to its unfunded plans for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the companys opeb plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows pretax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were 198 million 207 million and 202 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively changes in cash requirements reflect the net

in 2022 the company expects to contribute approximately 60 million to its pension plans other than the principal us pension plan and approximately 140 million to its opeb plans the company does not anticipate making contributions to its principal us pension plan in 2022 

the companys income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as opeb costs the following table summarizes the extent to which the companys income loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 was affected by pretax charges related to longterm employee benefits 



1 the year ended december 31 2021 includes a charge of 33 million for the company contributions to be paid in 2022 which was included in accrued and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

the above credit charges for pension and opeb are determined as of the beginning of each period longterm employee benefit plan credits were 1167 million and 213 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the change is due to the 2020 opeb plan amendments and lower discount rates see pension plans and other post employment benefits under the critical accounting estimates section beginning on page 60 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense 

for 2022 longterm employee benefits credit is expected to decrease by about 1 billion the decrease is mainly due to the 2020 opeb plan amendments an increase in the discount rates and a change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets from 575 percent to 450 percent

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates the company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results in the ordinary course of business the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls for additional information on these derivatives and related exposures see note 22  financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a casebycase basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure market volatility and economic trends foreign currency exchange contracts may be used from time to time to manage nearterm foreign currency cash requirements 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

the company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales purchases investments and borrowings the primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the brazilian real swiss franc canadian dollar and european euro eur the company uses foreign exchange contracts to offset its net exposures by currency related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations the company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the companys exposure to certain forecasted transactions investment in foreign subsidiaries as well as the translation of foreign currencydenominated earnings and uses commodity contracts to offset risks associated with foreign currency devaluation in certain countries in addition to the contracts disclosed in note 22  financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements from time to time the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar usd amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 

certain foreign entities of the company held usd denominated marketable securities mainly us government securities at december 31 2020 the usdeur was the primary foreign exchange exposure for these nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities these debt securities were classified as availableforsale marketable securities and as such fluctuations in foreign exchange were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within the consolidated statements of equity these fluctuations were subsequently reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to earnings during 2021 which was the period in which the marketable securities were sold at december 31 2021 the company no longer held these usd denominated marketable securities 

the following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at december 31 2021 and 2020 and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at december 31 2021 and 2020 the sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates 



since the companys risk management programs are highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

concentration of credit risk 

the company maintains cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions these financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution 

as part of the companys financial risk management processes it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service corteva and monitors actual exposures versus established limits the company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions 

the companys sales are not materially dependent on any single customer credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic industry and customer diversity associated with the companys global product lines

other countries also have rigorous approval processes procedures and scientific testing requirements for the cultivation or import of genetically modified seed products in the united states and other countries that have functioning regulatory systems a rigorous scientific review is conducted by these agencies to demonstrate that genetically modified products are as safe as traditionally bred nonbiotechgmo counterparts for food feed and the environment various countries in emea latin america and asia have banned gmos entirely 

regulation of crop protection products 

globally manufacturers of crop protection products including herbicides fungicides and insecticides are required to submit an applicationdossier and obtain government regulatory approval prior to selling products in a particular country in the united states the epa is responsible for registering and overseeing the approval and marketing of pesticides pursuant to the fifra the ffdca and the food quality protection act also the usda and the fda monitor levels of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops already registered pesticides are required to be reregistered every 15 years to ensure that those products continue to meet the rigorous safety standards set by the regulators the epa reevaluates pesticide tolerances every 10 years taking into account ecological and human health risks in addition to cumulative risks as a result of multiple routes of and sources of exposure 

our european operations are subject to the european chemical regulation reach “registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals” and the clp “classification labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures” other jurisdictions also have rigorous approval processes procedures and scientific testing requirements for the approval of crop protection products we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments related to pollution and other environmental health and safety matters

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our industry 

corteva may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of its products including its seed and crop protection products which could restrict its ability to sell those products in some markets 

regulatory and legislative requirements affect the development manufacture and distribution of corteva’s products including the testing and planting of seeds containing corteva’s biotechnology traits and the import of crops grown from those seeds and noncompliance can harm corteva’s sales and profitability 

seed products incorporating biotechnology derived traits and crop protection products must be extensively tested for safety efficacy and environmental impact before they can be registered for production use sale or commercialization in a given market in certain jurisdictions corteva must periodically renew its approvals for both biotechnology and crop protection products which typically require corteva to demonstrate compliance with thencurrent standards which generally are more stringent since the prior registration the regulatory approvals process is lengthy costly complex and in some markets unpredictable with requirements that can vary by product technology industry and country the regulatory approvals process for products that incorporate novel modes of action or new technologies can be particularly unpredictable and uncertain due to the thencurrent state of regulatory guidelines and objectives as well as governmental policy considerations and nongovernmental organization and other stakeholder considerations 

the successful development and commercialization of corteva’s pipeline products including enlist e3™ and conkesta e3® soybeans will be necessary for corteva’s growth 

corteva uses advanced breeding technologies to produce hybrids and varieties with superior performance in farmers’ fields and uses biotechnology to introduce traits that enhance specific characteristics of its crops corteva also uses advanced analytics software tools mobile communications and new planting and monitoring equipment to provide agronomic recommendations to growers additionally corteva conducts research into biological and chemical products to protect farmers’ crops from pests and diseases and enhance plant productivity 

new product concepts may be abandoned for many reasons including greater anticipated development costs technical difficulties lack of efficacy regulatory obstacles or inability to market under regulatory frameworks competition inability to prove the original concept lack of demand and the need to divert focus from time to time to other initiatives with perceived opportunities for better returns the processes of active ingredient development or discovery breeding biotechnology trait discovery and development and trait integration are lengthy and a very small percentage of the chemicals genes and germplasm corteva tests is selected for commercialization furthermore the length of time and the risk associated with the breeding and biotech pipelines are interlinked because both are required as a package for commercial success in markets where biotech traits are approved for growers for example the commercial transition to the company’s enlist e3™ and conkesta e3® soybean technologies which are packaged with its enlist one® and enlist duo® herbicides is expected to take the company several years to complete  in countries where biotech traits are not approved for widespread use corteva’s seed sales depend on the quality of its germplasm while initial commercialization efforts have been promising there are no guarantees that anticipated levels of product acceptability within cortevas markets will be achieved or that higher quality products will not be developed by cortevas competitors in the future 

speed in discovering developing protecting and responding to new technologies including new technologybased distribution channels that could facilitate corteva’s ability to engage with customers and end users and bringing related products to market is a significant competitive advantage commercial success frequently depends on being the first company to the market and many of corteva’s competitors are also making considerable investments in similar new biotechnology products improved germplasm products biological and chemical products and agronomic recommendation products 

the degree of public understanding and acceptance or perceived public acceptance of corteva’s biotechnology and other agricultural products and technologies can affect corteva’s sales and results of operations by affecting planting approvals regulatory requirements and customer purchase decisions 

concerns and claims regarding the safe use of seeds with biotechnology traits and crop protection products in general their potential impact on health and the environment and the perceived impacts of biotechnology on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection these include concerns and claims that increased use of crop protection products drift inversion volatilization and the use of biotechnology

traits meant to reduce the resistance of weeds or pests to control by crop protection products could increase or accelerate such resistance and otherwise negatively impact health and the environment these and other concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals preferred purchasing delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals delayed product launches lack of market acceptance product discontinuation continued pressure for and adoption of more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation termination of raw material supply agreements and legal claims these and other concerns could also influence public perceptions the viability or continued sales of certain of corteva’s products corteva’s reputation and the cost to comply with regulations as a result such concerns could have a material adverse effect corteva’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in agricultural and related policies of governments and international organizations may prove unfavorable 

in many markets there are various pressures to reduce government subsidies to farmers which may inhibit the growth in these markets of products used in agriculture in addition government programs that create incentives for farmers may be modified or discontinued however it is difficult to predict accurately whether and if so when such changes will occur corteva expects that the policies of governments and international organizations will continue to affect the planting choices made by growers as well as the income available to growers to purchase products used in agriculture and accordingly the operating results of the agriculture industry 

corteva participates in an industry that is highly competitive and has undergone consolidation which could increase competitive pressures 

corteva currently faces significant competition in the markets in which it operates in most segments of the market the number of products available to the grower is steadily increasing as new products are introduced at the same time certain products are coming off patent and are thus available to generic manufacturers for production and commercialization additionally data analytic tools and webbased new direct purchase models offer increased transparency and comparability which creates price pressures corteva cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of its competitors aggressive marketing or pricing by corteva’s competitors could adversely affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial conditions as a result corteva continues to face significant competitive challenges 

furthermore the detection of biotechnology traits or chemical residues from a crop protection product not approved in the country in which corteva sells or cultivates its product or in a country to which corteva imports its product may affect corteva’s ability to supply its products or export its products or even result in crop destruction product recalls or trade disruption which could result in lawsuits and termination of licenses related to biotechnology traits and raw material supply agreements delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to import including those related to the importation of crops grown from seeds containing certain traits or treated with specific chemicals may influence the rate of adoption of new products in globally traded crops 

additionally the regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of nongovernmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reaction to actual or perceived impacts of new and existing technology products or processes on safety health and the environment obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data which may require participation from technology providers regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing in addition corteva has seen an increase in recent years in the number of lawsuits filed by those who identify themselves as public or environmental interest groups seeking to invalidate pesticide product registrations andor challenge the way federal or state governmental entities apply the rules and regulations governing pesticide produce use the pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance responding to these changes and meeting existing and new requirements may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability the failure to receive necessary permits or approvals could have near and longterm effects on corteva’s ability to produce and sell some current and future products

item 1a risk factors continued 

corteva’s business may be materially affected by competition from manufacturers of generic products 

competition from manufacturers of generic products is a challenge for corteva’s branded products around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on corteva’s revenues the date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of corteva’s products or of a product that corteva licenses or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of corteva’s patented products or of a product that corteva licenses corteva can lose a major portion of revenues for that product which can have a material adverse effect on corteva’s business 

  

the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations substantial civil or criminal sanctions as well as the assessment of strict liability andor joint and several liability 

corteva is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws regulations rules and ordinances relating to pollution protection of the environment waste water discharges the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials and the use of genetically modified seeds and crop protection active ingredients by growers 

environmental and health and safety laws regulations and standards expose corteva to the risk of substantial costs and liabilities including liabilities associated with corteva’s business and the discontinued and divested businesses and operations of eid as is typical for businesses like corteva’s soil and groundwater contamination has occurred in the past at certain sites and may be identified at other sites in the future disposal of waste from corteva’s business at offsite locations also exposes it to potential remediation costs consistent with past practice corteva is continuing to monitor investigate and remediate soil and groundwater contamination at several of these sites 

  

costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements moreover changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt corteva’s operations or require modifications to its facilities accordingly environmental health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities which may be materially higher than corteva’s accruals 

climate change and unpredictable seasonal and weather factors could impact corteva’s sales and earnings 

the agriculture industry is subject to seasonal and weather factors which can vary unpredictably from period to period weather factors can affect the presence of disease and pests on a regional basis and accordingly can positively or adversely affect the demand for crop protection products including the mix of products used or the level of returns the weather also can affect the quality volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix seed yields can be higher or lower than planned which could lead to higher inventory and related writeoffs climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of extreme weather such as storms floods heat waves droughts and other events that could affect the quality volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix climate change may also affect the availability and suitability of arable land and contribute to unpredictable shifts in the average growing season and types of crops produced 

reduction in ethanol demand driven by declines in crude oil and gasoline consumption could negatively impact demand for corn which can negatively impact the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

during 2020 global and us crude oil price benchmarks suffered record declines in demand resulting from the covid19 pandemic stayathome orders and oversupply due to price disputes between russia and saudi arabia us ethanol producers have shut down their facilities and declared “force majeure” on shipments for corn purchases due to depressed demand similar trends with respect to biofuels like ethanol are occurring globally approximately onethird of us corn has been historically used in the production of ethanol for gasoline however us ethanol supplies bottomed at approximately 53 of its precovid19 us lockdown levels in april 2020 and have not yet rebounded to precovid lockdown levels this lost corn utilization to manufacture ethanol may add to ending corn inventory stock continued declines in the demand for corn or oversupply will negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations

corteva’s sales to its customers may be adversely affected should a company successfully establish an intermediary platform for the sale of corteva’s products or otherwise position itself between corteva and its customers 

corteva services customers primarily through the pioneer direct sales channel in key agricultural geographies including the united states in addition corteva supplements this approach with strong retail channels including distributors agricultural cooperatives and dealers and with digital solutions that assist farmer decisionmaking with a view to optimize their product selection and maximize their yield and profitability while corteva expects the indirect channels and its digital platform will extend its reach and increase exposure of its products to other potential customers including smaller farmers or farmers in less concentrated areas there can be no assurance that corteva will be successful in this regard if a competitor were to successfully establish an intermediary platform for distribution of corteva’s products especially with respect to corteva’s digital platform it may disrupt corteva’s distribution model and inhibit corteva’s ability to provide a complete gotomarket strategy covering the direct dealer and retail channels in such a circumstance corteva’s sales may be adversely affected 

risks related to our operations 

corteva is dependent on its relationships or contracts with third parties with respect to certain of its raw materials or licenses and commercialization 

corteva is dependent on third parties in the research development and commercialization of its products and enters into transactions including but not limited to supply agreements and licensing agreements in connection with corteva’s business the majority of corteva’s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits that corteva licenses from third parties under longterm licenses if corteva loses its rights under such licenses it could negatively impact corteva’s ability to obtain future licenses on competitive terms commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products to maintain such licenses corteva may elect to outlicense its technology including germplasm there can be no guarantee that such outlicensing will not ultimately strengthen corteva’s competition thereby adversely impacting corteva’s results of operations 

while corteva relies heavily on third parties for multiple aspects of its business and commercialization activities corteva does not control many aspects of such third parties’ activities third parties may not complete activities on schedule or in accordance with corteva’s expectations failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual or other obligations to corteva or to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any disruption in the relationship between corteva and one or more of these third parties could delay or prevent the development approval or commercialization of corteva’s products and could also result in noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for corteva’s business 

in addition corteva’s agreements with third parties may obligate it to meet certain contractual or other obligations to third parties for example corteva may be obligated to meet certain thresholds or abide by certain boundary conditions if corteva were to fail to meet such obligations to the third parties its relationship with such third parties may be disrupted such a disruption could negatively impact certain of corteva’s licenses on which it depends could cause reputational harm and could negatively affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by industrial espionage and other disruptions to its supply chain information technology or network systems 

business andor supply chain disruptions plant andor power outages and information technology system andor network disruptions regardless of cause including acts of sabotage employee error or other actions geopolitical activity local epidemics or pandemics weather events and natural disasters could seriously harm corteva’s operations as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers for example a pandemic in locations where corteva has significant operations sales or key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on corteva’s results of operations in addition terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased stakeholder concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution 

business andor supply chain disruptions may also be caused by security breaches which could include for example attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers viruses breaches due to employee error or actions or other disruptions corteva andor its suppliers may fail to effectively prevent detect and recover from these or other security breaches and as a consequence such breaches could result in misuse of corteva’s assets business disruptions loss of property including trade

secrets and confidential business information legal claims or proceedings reporting errors processing inefficiencies negative media attention loss of sales and interference with regulatory compliance 

like most major corporations corteva is the target of industrial espionage including cyberattacks from time to time corteva has determined that these incidents have resulted and could result in the future in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information however to date corteva has not experienced any material financial impact changes in the competitive environment or impact on business operations from these events although management does not believe that corteva has experienced any material losses to date related to industrial espionage and security breaches including cybersecurity incidents there can be no assurance that corteva will not suffer such losses in the future 

corteva actively manages the risks within its control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches as these threats continue to evolve particularly around cybersecurity corteva may be required to expend significant resources to enhance its control environment processes practices and other protective measures despite these efforts such events could also have a material adverse effect on corteva’s business financial condition results of operations and reputation additionally any losses from such an event may be excluded from or in excess of the coverages provided by cortevas insurance policies 

  

volatility in corteva’s input costs which include raw materials and production costs could have a significant impact on corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

corteva’s input costs are variable based on the costs associated with production or with raw materials corteva uses for example corteva’s production costs vary especially on a seasonal basis where changes in weather influence supply and demand in addition corteva’s manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of raw materials the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond corteva’s control corteva refers to these costs collectively as input costs significant variations in input costs affect corteva’s operating results from period to period 

when possible corteva purchases raw materials through negotiated longterm contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations corteva also enters into overthecounter and exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases in addition corteva takes actions to offset the effects of higher input costs through selling price increases productivity improvements and cost reduction programs success in offsetting higher input costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served if corteva is not able to fully offset the effects of higher input costs it could have a significant impact on its financial results 

  

corteva may be unable to achieve all the benefits that it expects to achieve from future restructuring and other cost savings initiatives which may adversely affect corteva’s results and negatively affect the value of corteva common stock 

restructurings cost savings programs synergy expectations and other similar initiatives can be complex costly and timeconsuming processes management may face significant challenges in implementing or realizing the expected benefits from these programs many of which may be beyond the control of management including without limitation 

• difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects 

• the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration or separation process including with respect to the intended tax efficient transactions 

• unanticipated issues in integrating replicating or separating information technology communications programs financial procedures and operations and other systems procedures and policies 

• addressing differences in business culture and retaining key personnel 

• unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations 

• managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of corteva and the intended tax efficient separation transactions 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

• coordinating geographically separate organizations 

• failing to successfully optimize corteva’s facilities footprint and operational programs and 

• failing to otherwise integrate eid’s or das’s respective agriculture businesses including their technology platforms 

some of these factors are outside of corteva’s control and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenue which could materially impact corteva’s business financial condition and results of operations 

if the anticipated benefits and cost savings from restructurings cost saving initiatives or transactions are not realized fully or take longer to realize than expected the value of corteva’s common stock revenues levels of expenses and results of operations may be affected adversely there can be no assurance that corteva will be able to sustain any or all the cost savings generated from its restructurings or cost savings initiatives 

  

corteva’s liquidity business results of operations and financial condition could be impaired if it is unable to raise capital through the capital markets or shortterm debt borrowings 

any limitation on corteva’s ability to raise money in the capital markets or through shortterm debt borrowings could have a substantial negative effect on corteva’s liquidity corteva’s ability to affordably access the capital markets andor borrow shortterm debt in amounts adequate to finance its activities could be impaired as a result of a variety of factors including factors that are not specific to corteva such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and in the case of debt securities or borrowings interest rate fluctuations due to the seasonality of corteva’s business and the credit programs corteva may offer its customers net working capital investment and corresponding debt levels will fluctuate over the course of the year 

corteva regularly extends credit to its customers to enable them to purchase seeds or crop protection products at the beginning of the growing season the customer receivables may be used as collateral for shortterm financing programs any material adverse effect upon corteva’s ability to own or sell such customer receivables including seasonal factors that may impact the amount of customer receivables corteva owns may materially impact corteva’s access to capital 

corteva has additional agreements with financial institutions to establish programs that provide financing for select customers of corteva’s seed and crop protection products in the united states latin america europe and asia the programs are renewed on an annual basis in most cases corteva guarantees the extension of such credit to such customers if corteva is unable to renew these agreements or access the debt markets to support customer financing corteva’s sales may be negatively impacted which could result in increased borrowing needs to fund working capital 

corteva’s earnings operations and business among other things will impact its credit ratings costs and availability of financing a decrease in the ratings assigned to corteva or eid by the ratings agencies may negatively impact corteva’s access to the debt capital markets and increase corteva’s cost of borrowing and the financing of its seasonal working capital 

there can be no assurance that corteva or eid will maintain its current or prospective credit ratings any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit ratings may have a negative impact on corteva’s liquidity capital position or access to capital markets 

  

corteva’s customers may be unable to pay their debts to corteva which could adversely affect corteva’s results 

corteva offers its customers financing programs with credit terms generally less than one year from invoicing in alignment with the growing season due to these credit practices as well as the seasonality of corteva’s operations corteva may need to issue shortterm debt at certain times of the year to fund its cash flow requirements corteva’s customers may be exposed to a variety of conditions that could adversely affect their ability to pay their debts for example customers in economies experiencing an economic downturn or in a region experiencing adverse growing conditions may be unable to repay their obligations to corteva which could adversely affect corteva’s results

through cortevas ownership of eid corteva maintains eid defined benefit pension and other postemployment benefit plans for some of these plans including eid’s principal us pension plan corteva continues as sponsor for the entire plan regardless of whether participants including retirees are or were associated with eid’s agriculture business corteva uses many assumptions in calculating its expected future payment obligations under these plans significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than assumed in addition expected future payment obligations may be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions regarding participants including retirees in 2021 corteva expects to contribute approximately 47 million to its pension plans other than the principal us pension plan and about 217 million for its other postemployment benefit opeb plans additionally corteva may make potential discretionary contributions to the principal us pension plan in 2021 corteva furthermore may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future which could adversely affect corteva’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

  

corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by environmental litigation and other commitments and contingencies 

as a result of corteva’s operations including past operations and those related to divested businesses and discontinued operations of eid corteva incurs environmental operating costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits corteva also incurs environmental operating costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials in addition corteva maintains and periodically reviews and adjusts its accruals for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs 

corteva expects to continue to incur environmental operating costs since it will operate global manufacturing product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations these rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency which corteva monitors closely corteva’s policy requires that its operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements in addition corteva expects to continue certain voluntary programs and could consider additional voluntary actions to reduce air emissions minimize the generation of hazardous waste decrease the volume of water use and discharges increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent bioaccumulative and toxic materials costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs and goals are significant and corteva expects these costs will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future over the long term such expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and could fluctuate significantly 

corteva accrues for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs corteva expects to base such estimates on several factors including the complexity of the geology the nature and extent of contamination the type of remedy the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties “prps” at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other prps considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and under adverse changes in circumstances the potential liability may be materially higher than corteva’s accruals 

corteva faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters arising out of the normal course of its current and former business operations including intellectual property commercial product liability environmental and antitrust lawsuits corteva has noted a trend in public and private suits being filed on behalf of states counties cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public and the environment including waterways and watersheds claims alleging harm to the public and the environment may be brought against corteva notwithstanding years of scientific evidence and regulatory determinations supporting the safety of crop protection products the litigation involving monsanto’s roundup ® nonselective glyphosate containing weedkiller products has resulted in negative publicity and sentiment and may lead to similar suits with respect to glyphosatecontaining products andor other established crop protection products claims and allegations that corteva’s products or products that corteva manufactures or markets on behalf of third parties are not safe could result in litigation damage to corteva’s reputation and have a material adverse effect on corteva’s business it is not possible to predict the outcome of these various proceedings and any potential impact on corteva an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters may result in losses not fully covered by cortevas insurance policies and could be material to cortevas financial results various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such factors and developments may include but are not limited to additional data safety or risk assessments as well as a final adverse judgment significant

in the ordinary course of business corteva may make certain commitments including representations warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations including those related to divested businesses and issue guarantees of third party obligations if corteva were required to make payments as a result they could exceed the amounts accrued thereby adversely affecting corteva’s financial condition and results of operations 

corteva’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks and restrictions which could negatively affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

corteva’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks and restrictions including fluctuations in foreigncurrency exchange rates exchange control regulations corruption risks competitive restrictions changes in local political or economic conditions import and trade restrictions import or export licensing requirements and trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad in addition corteva’s international operations are sometimes in countries with unstable governments economic or fiscal challenges military or political conflicts local epidemics or pandemics significant levels of crime and organized crime or developing legal systems this may increase the risk to the companys employees subcontractors or other parties and to other liabilities such as property loss or damage to the companys products and may affect cortevas ability to safely operate in or import into or receive raw materials from these countries 

additionally corteva’s ability to export its products and its sales outside the united states has been and may continue to be adversely affected by significant changes in trade tax or other policies including the risk that other countries may retaliate through the imposition of their own trade restrictions andor increased tariffs in response to substantial changes to us trade and tax policies 

although corteva has operations throughout the world corteva’s sales outside the united states in 2020 were principally to customers in brazil eurozone countries and canada further corteva’s largest currency exposures are the brazilian real swiss franc european euro eur and canadian dollar market uncertainty or an economic downturn in these geographic areas could reduce demand for corteva’s products and result in decreased sales volume which could have a negative impact on corteva’s results of operations in addition changes in exchange rates may affect corteva’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods corteva actively manages currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions and committed purchases 

failure to effectively manage acquisitions divestitures alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact corteva’s future results

cortevas business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics the severity magnitude and duration of the current covid19 pandemic and future outbreaks is uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict to date the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted foreign currency exchange rates as a result of a generally stronger us dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which the company operates which has adversely affected the companys reported results of operations these relative differences could widen and further adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

covid19 and the related governmentimposed restrictions including stay at home orders has significantly impacted other economic activity and markets around the world which could negatively impact the companys business financial condition and results of operations in numerous ways including but not limited to those outlined below 

• current and future covid19 outbreaks and resulting illness travel restrictions and workforce disruptions could impact cortevas global supply chain its operations and its routes to market or those of its suppliers comanufacturers or customersdistributors these disruptions or the companys failure to effectively respond to them could increase product or distribution costs alter the timing of recognizing manufacturing costs or impact the delivery of products to customers 

• government or regulatory responses to pandemics could negatively impact the companys business mandatory lockdowns or other restrictions on operations in certain countries have temporarily disrupted the companys ability to operate or distribute its products in these markets continuation or expansion of these disruptions could materially adversely impact the companys operations and results 

• reductions to the company’s forecasted profitability and continued global economic decline could trigger potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

• the instability or unavailability of a farm workforce to harvest agricultural products could impact the companys customers’ ability to monetize their crop and potentially impact the collection of the companys customer receivables 

• continued commodity cost volatility is expected and the companys commodity hedging activities may not sufficiently offset this volatility depressed commodity prices may increase the insolvency risk of cortevas customers in the longerterm along with reducing the demand for cortevas products 

• disruptions or uncertainties related to the covid19 outbreak for a sustained period of time could result in delays or modifications to the companys strategic plans and productivity initiatives 

• increased volatility and pricing in the capital and commercial paper markets may reoccur and impact the companys access to preferred sources of liquidity resulting in higher borrowing costs the company cannot assure investors that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms 

• increased market volatility may bring unprecedented market conditions making it difficult for the company to adequately forecast customer demand or price its products 

therefore the impact of the recent covid19 outbreak and the unprecedented economic conditions resulting from it will have on the companys consolidated results of operations is uncertain but could still negatively impact the companys business operations financial performance and results of operations in the future 

corteva’s business or stock price could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders 

cortevas board of directors and management value constructive input from our stockholders and are committed to acting in the best interests of all our stockholders however corteva may be subject to actions or proposals from stockholders or others that may not align with its business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders 

the company recently received a notice from starboard value and opportunity master fund ltd “starboard” of its intention to nominate eight director candidates for election to the company’s board of directors at the company’s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders starboard has also made public statements calling for changes to our management responding to these actions by starboard and potential actions by other activist stockholders could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt the companys operations and divert the attention of its board of directors management and our employees a contested election with respect to the companys directors could also require the company to incur substantial legal public relations and other advisory fees and proxy solicitation expenses in addition perceived uncertainties as to cortevas future direction strategy or leadership created

item 1a risk factors continued 

as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities harm our ability to attract new investors customers employees suppliers and other strategic partners the perceived uncertainties as to the company’s future direction strategy or leadership also could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility 

risks related to our intellectual property 

enforcing corteva’s intellectual property rights or defending against intellectual property claims asserted by others could materially affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

intellectual property rights including patents plant variety protection trade secrets confidential information trademarks trade names and other forms of trade dress are important to corteva’s business corteva endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported however corteva may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual property in key jurisdictions further changes in government policies and regulations including changes made in reaction to pressure from nongovernmental organizations or the public generally could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions 

corteva has designed and implemented internal controls to restrict use of access to and distribution of its intellectual property despite these precautions corteva’s intellectual property is vulnerable to infringement misappropriation and other unauthorized access including through employee or licensee error or actions theft and cybersecurity incidents and other security breaches when unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered corteva reports such situations to governmental authorities for investigation as appropriate and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be selfreplicating 

competitors are increasingly challenging intellectual property positions and the outcomes can be highly uncertain third parties may claim corteva’s products violate their intellectual property rights defending such claims even those without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive in addition any such claim could result in corteva’s having to enter into license agreements develop noninfringing products or engage in litigation that could be costly if challenges are resolved adversely it could negatively impact corteva’s ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms develop and commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products 

in addition because of the rapid pace of technological change the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions andor the uncertainty in predicting the outcome of complex proceedings relating to ownership and the scope of patents relating to certain emerging technologies competitors may be issued patents related to corteva’s business unexpectedly these patents could reduce the value of corteva’s commercial or pipeline products or to the extent they cover key technologies on which corteva has relied require corteva to seek to obtain licenses and corteva cannot ensure it would be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or cease using the technology no matter how valuable to corteva’s business 

legislation and jurisprudence on patent protection is evolving and changes in laws could affect corteva’s ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for and otherwise enforce corteva’s patents related to its products 

corteva’s business may be adversely affected by the availability of counterfeit products 

a counterfeit product is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit corteva product therefore is one manufactured by someone other than corteva but which appears to be the same as an authentic corteva product the prevalence of counterfeit products is a significant and growing industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit products can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual consumers the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit products and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters compared to the large profits that can be earned by them from the sale of counterfeit products further laws against counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing laws varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some countries counterfeiting is not a crime in others it may result in only minimal sanctions in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit products use complex transport routes to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

corteva’s global reputation makes its products prime targets for counterfeiting organizations counterfeit products pose a risk to consumer health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit products which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain could adversely impact corteva’s business by among other things causing the loss of consumer confidence in corteva’s name and in the integrity of its products potentially resulting in lost sales and an increased threat of litigation 

corteva undertakes significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit products including among other things working with regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of products and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy corteva’s products and easier for consumers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit products working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit products working collaboratively with wholesalers customs offices and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors and working with other members of an international trade association of agrochemical companies to promote initiatives to combat counterfeiting activity no assurance can be given however that corteva’s efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit products may continue to increase 

restrictions under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements limit corteva’s ability to develop and commercialize certain products and services andor prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property 

the company is dependent to a certain extent on dupont and dow to maintain and enforce certain of the intellectual property licensed under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements for example dupont and dow are responsible for filing prosecuting and maintaining at their respective discretion patents on trade secrets and knowhow that they each respectively license to corteva they also have the first right to enforce their respective trade secrets and knowhow licensed to corteva if dupont or dow as applicable fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents trade secrets or knowhow under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements the company may not be able to prevent competitors from making using and selling competitive products and services 

in addition corteva’s use of the intellectual property licensed to it under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements is restricted to certain fields which could limit corteva’s ability to develop and commercialize certain products and services for example the licenses granted to corteva under the agreement will not extend to all fields of use that the company may decide to enter into in the future these restrictions may make it more difficult time consuming andor expensive for corteva to develop and commercialize certain new products and services or may result in certain of its products or services being later to market than those of its competitors 

risks related to the separation 

the company may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that it expected to achieve from the separation from dowdupont 

corteva continues to among other things focus its financial and operational resources on its specific business growth profile and strategic priorities guide its processes and infrastructure to focus on its core strengths maintain a capital structure designed to meet its specific needs and more effectively respond to agricultural industry dynamics all of which are benefits the company expected to achieve from its separation however the company may be unable to fully achieve some or all of these benefits 

for example in order to position itself for the separation and distribution the company undertook a series of strategic structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within its operations these actions may not provide the benefits the company expected and could lead to disruption of operations loss of or inability to recruit key personnel needed to operate and grow its businesses following the separation weakening of its internal standards controls or procedures and impairment of its key customer and supplier relationships if the company fails to achieve some or all of the benefits that it expected to achieve as an independent company or does not achieve them in the time expected its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

further the company’s business traditionally was operated under the umbrella of dowdupont’s corporate organization with portions of its businesses being integrated with the businesses of historical dupont and historical dow this integration has 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

historically permitted its business or portions thereof to enjoy economies of scope and scale in costs employees vendor relationships and customer relationships both as part of the dowdupont organization and within the historical dupont and historical dow internal corporate structures the loss of these benefits could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

in connection with the separation the company has assumed and agreed to indemnify dupont and dow for certain liabilities if the company is required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities the company may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and its financial results could be negatively impacted in addition dupont and dow will indemnify corteva for certain liabilities these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities it incurs and dupont andor dow andor their historical separated businesses may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation agreement the employee matters agreement and the tax matters agreement with dupont and dow the company agreed to assume and indemnify dupont and dow for certain liabilities for uncapped amounts which may include among other items associated defense costs settlement amounts and judgments as discussed further in note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements and part i  item 3  legal proceedings payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact the company’s business particularly indemnities relating to certain litigation for historical dupont operations or its actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the corteva distribution third parties could also seek to hold the company responsible for any of the liabilities allocated to dupont and dow including those related to dowdupont’s specialty products andor materials science businesses respectively and those related to discontinued andor divested businesses and operations of historical dow which have been allocated to dow dupont andor dow as applicable will agree to indemnify corteva for such liabilities but such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect the company against the full amount of such liabilities in addition dupont andor dow as applicable may not be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations with respect to the liabilities the company incurs even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from dupont andor dow as applicable any amounts for which the company is held liable the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself each of these risks could negatively affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally the company generally has assumed and is responsible for the payment of its share of i certain liabilities of dowdupont relating to arising out of or resulting from certain general corporate matters of dowdupont ii certain liabilities of historical dupont relating to arising out of or resulting from general corporate matters of historical dupont and discontinued andor divested businesses and operations of historical dupont including its spinoff of chemours and iii certain separation expenses not otherwise allocated to dupont or dow or allocated specifically to corteva pursuant to the corteva separation agreement and third parties could seek to hold corteva responsible for dupont’s or dow’s share of any such liabilities for more information see note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements and part i  item 3  legal proceedings dupont andor dow as applicable will indemnify corteva for their share of any such liabilities however such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect corteva against the full amount of such liabilities andor dupont andor dow may not be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in addition even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from dupont andor dow any amounts for which the company is held liable in excess of its agreed share the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself and may not be able to fully insure itself to cover these risks each of these risks could materially affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the separation and related transactions may expose corteva to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws 

although the company received a solvency opinion from an investment bank confirming that the company and dupont were each adequately capitalized following the distribution the separation could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws in connection with fraudulent conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent or that rendered the debtor insolvent inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due any unpaid creditor could claim that dupont did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the separation and corteva distribution and that the separation and corteva distribution left dupont insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that dupont intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured additionally under its indemnity provisions of the separation agreement the company could find its liabilities increased as a result of a court concluding that historical 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

dupont historical dow or dowdupont executed a fraudulent conveyance in connection with divestitures and spinoffs of any one of their historical operations including chemours if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff then such court could void the separation and distribution as a fraudulent transfer or impose substantial liabilities on corteva which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations among other things the court could return some of corteva’s assets or shares of corteva common stock to dupont provide dupont with a claim for money damages against corteva in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by dupont and the fair market value of corteva at the time of the corteva distribution or require corteva to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the internal reorganization and business realignment for the benefit of creditors 

the distribution is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes under the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either i out of its surplus net assets minus capital or ii if there is no such surplus out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year although the distribution was made out of dowdupont’s surplus and the company received an opinion that dowdupont has adequate surplus under delaware law to declare the dividend of corteva common stock in connection with the corteva distribution there can be no assurance that a court will not later determine that some or all of the corteva distribution was unlawful 

if the corteva distribution together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes then the company could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability and stockholders receiving corteva common stock in the corteva distribution could be subject to significant tax liability 

dowdupont received an irs tax ruling and tax opinion that among other things the corteva distribution and certain related transactions will qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 and section 368a1d of the internal revenue code the code the irs ruling and tax opinion relied on certain facts assumptions and undertakings and certain representations from dowdupont and corteva regarding the past and future conduct of both respective businesses and other matters despite the tax opinion and the irs ruling the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion 

if the corteva distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable then a stockholder of dupont that received shares of corteva common stock would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares including any fractional shares sold on behalf of such stockholder on the distribution date and could incur significant income tax liabilities such distribution would be taxable to such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of dupont’s current and accumulated earnings and profits which would include any earnings and profits attributable to the gain recognized by dupont on the taxable distribution and could include earnings and profits attributable to certain internal transactions preceding the corteva distribution any amount that exceeded dupont’s earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in its shares of dupont stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a gain on the dupont stock in the event the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable dupont would recognize corporate level taxable gain on the distribution in an amount equal to the excess if any of the fair market value of corteva common stock distributed to dupont stockholders on the distribution date over dupont’s tax basis in such stock in addition if certain related transactions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state local tax andor foreign tax law corteva and dupont could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law 

generally taxes resulting from the failure of the separation and distributions to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes would be imposed on dupont or dupont stockholders under the tax matters agreement that the company entered into with dupont and dow subject to the exceptions described below the company is generally obligated to indemnify dupont against such taxes imposed on dupont however if the distributions fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the merger and the distributions then under the tax matters agreement dupont and dow would share the tax liability resulting from such failure in accordance with their relative equity values on the first full trading day following the dow distribution the company and dupont would share any liabilities of dupont described in the preceding sentence in accordance with its relative equity values on the first full trading day following the corteva distribution furthermore under the terms of the tax matters agreement the company also generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on dupont or dow that arise from the failure of the corteva distribution to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or the

item 1a risk factors continued 

failure of certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to its or its affiliates’ stock assets or business or any breach of its representations made in any representation letter provided to its counsel in connection with the tax opinion dupont and dow will be separately responsible for any taxes imposed on corteva that arise from the failure of the corteva distribution to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to such company’s or its affiliates’ stock assets or business or any breach of such company’s representations made in connection with the irs ruling or in the representation letter provided to counsel in connection with the tax opinion events triggering an indemnification obligation under the tax matters agreement include events occurring after the corteva distribution that cause dupont to recognize a gain under section 355e of the code as discussed further below such tax amounts could be significant to the extent that the company is responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on corteva’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods 

the company agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the taxfree treatment of the transactions separating it from dowdupont in the united states which may reduce corteva’s strategic and operating flexibility 

the company’s ability to engage in certain transactions is limited or restricted to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distributions by dowdupont and certain aspects of the internal reorganization and business realignment as a result of these limitations under the tax matters agreement that the company entered into with dupont and dow for the twoyear period following the distribution the company is prohibited except in certain circumstances from among other things 

• entering into any transaction resulting in acquisitions of a certain percentage of its assets whether by merger or otherwise 

• dissolving merging consolidating or liquidating 

• undertaking or permitting any transaction relating to corteva stock including issuances redemptions or repurchases other than certain limited permitted issuances and repurchases 

• affecting the relative voting rights of corteva stock whether by amending corteva’s certificate of incorporation or otherwise or 

• ceasing to actively conduct its business 

these restrictions may significantly limit corteva’s ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that the company may believe to otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders or that might increase the value of its business 

the irs may assert that the merger causes the distributions and other related transactions to be taxable to dupont in which case the company could be subject to significant indemnification liability 

even if the distributions otherwise constitutes a taxfree transaction to stockholders under section 355 of the code dupont may be required to recognize corporate level tax on the distributions and certain related transactions under section 355e of the code if as a result of the merger or other transactions considered part of a plan with the distributions there is a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in dupont or corteva in connection with the merger dowdupont received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the proper time manner and methodology for measuring common ownership in the stock of dowdupont historical dupont and historical dow for purposes of determining whether there has been a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under section 355e of the code as a result of the merger the tax opinion relied on the continued validity of the private letter ruling as well as certain factual representations from dowdupont as to the extent of common ownership in the stock of historical dupont and historical dow immediately prior to the merger based on the representations made by dowdupont as to the common ownership in the stock of historical dupont and historical dow immediately prior to the merger and assuming the continued validity of the irs ruling the tax opinion concluded that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in dowdupont historical dupont or historical dow for purposes of section 355e as a result of the merger notwithstanding the tax opinion and the irs ruling the irs could determine that the distributions or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to dupont if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations or undertakings of dowdupont is not correct or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling if dupont is required to recognize corporate level tax on either of the distributions and certain related transactions under section 355e of the code then under the tax matters agreement the company may be required to indemnify dupont andor

dow for all or a portion of such taxes which could be a material amount if such taxes were the result of either direct or indirect transfers of corteva common stock or certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the merger and the distributions 

the company is subject to continuing contingent taxrelated liabilities of dowdupont following the distribution 

there are several significant areas where the liabilities of dowdupont may become corteva’s obligations either in whole or in part for example under the code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of dowdupont’s consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for such taxable period additionally to the extent that any subsidiary of corteva was included in the consolidated tax reporting group of either historical dupont or historical dow for any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the merger such subsidiary is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group of historical dupont or historical dow as applicable for such taxable period in connection with the distributions on april 1 2019 the company entered into the tax matters agreement with dupont and dow that allocates the responsibility for prior period consolidated taxes among corteva dupont and dow if dupont or dow were unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible however the company could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes and such amounts could be significant other provisions of federal state local or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

corteva’s unaudited pro forma combined financial information is not necessarily representative of the results the company would have achieved as an independent publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results 

the unaudited pro forma financial information of corteva included herein refer to supplemental unaudited pro forma financial statements on page 51 may not reflect what corteva’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows would have been had the company been an independent publicly traded company comprised solely of dowdupont’s agriculture business during the periods presented this is primarily because 

• the historical financial information of corteva does not reflect the changes that the company experienced in connection with the separation including the distribution 

• prior to the separation corteva’s business was operated under the corporate umbrella of dowdupont as part of the dowdupont corporate organization corteva’s business was principally operated by historical dupont with certain portions of its business being operated by historical dow as part of its internal corporate organization rather than being operated as part of a consolidated agriculture business 

• the historical financial information of corteva reflects only corporate expenses of historical dupont and allocated corporate expenses from historical dow and thus is not necessarily representative of the costs the company incurred for similar services as an independent company following the separation

critical accounting estimates 

the companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the companys operating results and financial condition 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts including but not limited to receivable and inventory valuations impairment of tangible and intangible assets longterm employee benefit obligations income taxes environmental matters and litigation managements estimates are based on historical experience facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable the company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the companys accounting policies which could have a material effect on the companys financial position liquidity or results of operations 

pension plans and other post employment benefits 

accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the companys pension and opeb plans management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are remeasured these and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate as permitted by gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive 

substantially all of the companys benefit obligation for pensions and opeb are attributable to the benefit plans in the us in the us the single equivalent discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixedincome instruments provided by the plans actuaries as of the measurement date the company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for nonus benefit plans historically the company utilized prevailing longterm high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate applicable to each country at the measurement date

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

within the us the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries where appropriate assetliability studies are also taken into consideration the longterm expected return on plan assets in the us is based upon historical real returns net of inflation for the asset classes covered by the investment policy expected performance and projections of inflation and interest rates over the longterm period during which benefits are payable to plan participants in determining the 2020 net periodic pension cost in the us 625 percent of longterm expected return on plan assets assumption was used after reevaluating the current strategic asset allocation and recent market conditions the company lowered the longterm expected return on plan assets assumption to 575 percent to be used in determining 2021 net periodic pension cost in the us consistent with prior years the longterm expected return on plan assets in the us reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the companys active management of the plans assets 

i n determining annual expense for the principal us pension plan the company uses a marketrelated value of assets rather than its fair value accordingly there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation as a result changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the companys calculation of net periodic pension cost for the year ended december 31 2020 the marketrelated value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months however as a result of the merger the marketrelated value of assets was calculated by averaging market returns from september 1 2017 through the years ended december 31 2018 and 2019 

the following table shows the marketrelated value and fair value of plan assets for the principal us pension plan 



for plans other than the principal us pension plan pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets 

the following table highlights the potential impact on the companys pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the companys pension and opeb plans based on assets and liabilities at december 31 2020 



additional information with respect to pension and opeb expenses liabilities and assumptions is discussed under longterm employee benefits beginning on page 73 and in note 20  pension plans and other post employment benefits to the consolidated financial statements

environmental matters 

accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated at december 31 2020 the company had accrued obligations of 329 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs including 52 million for the remediation of superfund sites as remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs the companys estimates are based on a number of factors including the complexity of the geology the nature and extent of contamination the type of remedy the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties prps at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other prps therefore considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs and under adverse changes in circumstances it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to 620 million above that amount consequently it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows it is the opinion of the company’s management however that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition or cash flows for further discussion see environmental matters in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 3  recent accounting guidance and note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

the companys results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company including product liability claims patent infringement and antitrust claims and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts the company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations settlements rulings advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters management considers many factors these factors include but are not limited to the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims the companys experience with similar types of claims the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed input from outside legal counsel the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matters current status considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding in such situations the company will not recognize a loss if based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements 

indemnification assets 

the company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities by dupont dow and chemours the term of this indemnification is generally indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses as well as monetary and nonmonetary settlements and judgments in connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable in assessing the probability of recovery the company considers the contractual rights under the separation agreements and any potential credit risk future events such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of dupont dow and  or chemours could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded the company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable see note 5  divestitures and other transactions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to indemnifications 

income taxes 

the breadth of the companys operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in the normal course of business the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the companys tax assets and tax liabilities it is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant however due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and

possible outcomes a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made 

deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the companys assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies for example changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period in some situations these changes could be material see note 10  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

at december 31 2020 the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of 429 million inclusive of a valuation allowance of 453 million realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time as a result changes in tax laws assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets see note 10  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance 

valuation of assets and impairment considerations 

the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in the companys valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates royalty rates and discount rates although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill other intangible assets property plant and equipment investments in nonconsolidated affiliates and other assets is an integral part of the companys normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects managements best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environment in which the companys segments operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices market growth and inflation rates can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized in addition the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the companys growth strategy strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets such an assessment could result in impairment losses 

the company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment one level below the operating segment or component is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities the company’s reporting units include seed crop protection and digital 

for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed at the company level include but are not limited to gdp growth rates longterm commodity prices equity and credit market activity discount rates foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include but are not limited to changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and new product launches cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting unit if the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment 

part ii 

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value additional quantitative testing is required 

if additional quantitative testing is required the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge if any is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company determines fair values for each of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model a form of the income approach utilizing level 3 unobservable inputs or the market approach 

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate the company’s significant assumptions in these analyses include future cash flow projections weighted average cost of capital the terminal growth rate and the tax rate the company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates recent operating results and planned business strategy and includes an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on its most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts the company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzes published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing the company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts discount rates used in the company’s valuations ranged from 95 to 155 under the market approach the company uses metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions for comparable companies 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods the company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate based on the goodwill impairment analyses performed in the fourth quarter 2020 the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 20 percent and no goodwill impairment charge was necessary 

prepaid royalties 

the company’s seed segment currently has certain thirdparty biotechnology trait license agreements which require upfront and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions these payments are reflected as other current assets and other assets and are amortized to cost of goods sold as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the term of the license the rate of royalty amortization expense recognized is based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio market dynamics farmer preferences growth rates and projected planted acres changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology could impact the rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty 

at december 31 2020 the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in other current assets and other assets was 426 million and 459 million respectively the majority of the balance of prepaid royalties relates to the company’s wholly owned subsidiary pioneer hibred international inc’s “pioneer” nonexclusive license in the united states and canada for the monsanto companys genuity ® roundup ready 2 yield ® glyphosate tolerance trait and roundup ready 2 xtend ® glyphosate and dicamba tolerance trait for soybeans “roundup ready 2 license agreement” the prepaid royalty asset relates to a series of upfront fixed and variable royalty payments to utilize the traits in pioneer’s soybean product mix the company’s historical expectation has been that the technology licensed under the roundup ready 2 license agreement would be used as the primary herbicide tolerance trait platform in the pioneer ® brand soybean through the term of the agreement das and ms technologies llc jointly developed and own the enlist e3 tm herbicide tolerance trait for soybeans which provides tolerance to 2 4d choline in enlist duo ® and enlist one ® herbicides as well as glyphosate and glufosinate herbicides in connection with the validation of breeding plans and largescale product development timelines during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company accelerated the ramp up of the enlist e3 tm trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands including pioneer ® brands over the subsequent five years during the rampup period the company is expected to significantly reduce the volume of products with the roundup ready 2 yield ® and roundup ready 2 xtend ® herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021 with expected minimal use of the trait platform thereafter for the remainder of the roundup ready 2 license agreement the “transition plan” the rate of royalty expense is therefore expected to significantly increase through higher amortization of the prepaid royalty as fewer seeds containing the respective trait are expected to be utilized

in connection with the departure from these traits in the companys product portfolio beginning january 1 2020 the company presents and discloses the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a component of restructuring and asset related charges  net in the consolidated statement of operations the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense represents the difference between the rate of amortization based on the revised number of units expected to contain the roundup ready 2 yield ® and roundup ready 2 xtend ® trait technology and the per unit cash rate per the roundup ready 2 license agreement for the year ended december 31 2020 the company recognized 159 million in restructuring and asset related charges  net in the consolidated statement of operations from noncash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense the expected noncash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense estimated for 2021 is approximately 184 million aggregating to approximately 360 million over the next four years 

further changes in factors and assumptions associated with usage of the trait platform licensed under the roundup ready 2 license agreement including the transition plan could further impact the rate of recognition of the prepaid royalty and statement of operations presentation of the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense

certain guarantee contracts 

information with respect to the companys guarantees is included in note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements historically the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations however the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees 

contractual obligations 

information related to the companys significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table 



1 included in the consolidated financial statements 

2 represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of 1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the agreement 

3 the companys contractual obligations do not reflect an offset for recoveries associated with indemnifications by chemours dow and dupont in accordance with the chemours separation agreement and the separation agreement related to the corteva distribution respectively refer to note 5  divestitures and other transactions and note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail related to the indemnifications

7 the timing and amount of escrow funding requirements under the mou cannot be estimated as a result of the cost sharing arrangement with dupont and have been excluded from the table see note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

longterm employee benefits 

the company has various obligations to its employees and retirees the company maintains retirementrelated programs in many countries that have a longterm impact on the companys earnings and cash flows these plans are typically defined benefit pension plans as well as medical dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees other post employment benefits or opeb plans substantially all of the companys worldwide benefit 

part ii 

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

obligation for pensions and essentially all of the companys worldwide opeb obligations are attributable to the us benefit plans 

pension coverage for employees of the companys nonus consolidated subsidiaries is provided to the extent deemed appropriate through separate plans the company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics life expectancy and countryspecific pension funding rules change where permitted by applicable law the company reserves the right to change modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension medical dental life insurance and disability benefits 

benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement in november 2016 the company announced changes to the us pension and opeb plans the company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the us pension plans on november 30 2018 therefore as of november 30 2018 active employees participating in the us pension plans will not accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation received in addition to the changes to the us pension plans opeb eligible employees who will be under the age of 50 as of november 30 2018 will not receive postretirement medical dental and life insurance benefits the majority of employees hired in the us on or after january 1 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and postretirement medical dental and life insurance plans but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans 

in december 2020 the company amended its retiree medical dental and life insurance plans effective january 1 2022 the company will no longer provide retiree dental and life insurance benefits in addition corteva’s portion of the cost of nonmedicare retiree medical coverage will no longer be adjusted for cost increases resulting in corteva’s cost to be capped at the level in effect as of december 31 2021 as a result of these changes the company recorded a 939 million decrease in opeb benefit obligations as of december 31 2020 with a corresponding prior service benefit within other comprehensive income for the year ended december 31 2020 

pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits the company did not make contributions to the principal us pension plan for the year ended december 31 2020 funding for each pension plan other than the principal us pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates thus there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense in general however improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs the company contributed 9 million 39 million and 103 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal us pension plan for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

us pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows the companys remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows the company made benefit payments of 53 million 82 million and 111 million to its unfunded plans for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the companys opeb plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows pretax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were 207 million 202 million and 216 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs demographic changes plan amendments and changes in participant premiums copays and deductibles 

in 2021 the company expects to contribute approximately 47 million to its pension plans other than the principal us pension plan the company expects to contribute approximately 217 million to its opeb plans in 2021 and expects the amount to decrease to approximately 140 million in 2022 as a result of the opeb plan amendment the company is evaluating potential discretionary contributions in 2021 to the principal us pension plan that could reduce a portion of the underfunded benefit obligation any discretionary contributions depend on various factors including market conditions and tax deductible limits 

part ii 

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the companys income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as opeb costs the following table summarizes the extent to which the companys income loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 was affected by pretax charges related to longterm employee benefits 



the above credit charges for pension and opeb are determined as of the beginning of each period longterm employee credits were 213 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and 48 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the change is due to lower discount rates see pension plans and other post employment benefits under the critical accounting estimates section beginning on page 67 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense 

for 2021 longterm employee benefits credit is expected to increase by about 930 million the increase is mainly due to amendments to the opeb plans and a decrease in the discount rates partly offset by a change in expected return on plan assets from 625 percent to 575 percent 

environmental matters 

the company operates global manufacturing product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency and the company monitors these changes closely company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements in addition the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions minimize the generation of hazardous waste decrease the volume of water use and discharges increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent bioaccumulative and toxic materials management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs and goals are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future 

pretax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below 



1 environmental remediation costs include costs that are subject to the 200 million thresholds and sharing arrangements as discussed in note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements under corteva separation agreement 

about 85 percent of total pretax environmental operating costs charged to income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2020 resulted from operations in the us based on existing facts and circumstances management does not believe that yearoveryear changes if any in environmental operating costs charged to current operations will have a material impact on the companys financial position liquidity or results of operations annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 

environmental operating costs 

as a result of its operations the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits the company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials

remediation accrual 

changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below 



1 excludes indemnified remediation obligations 

2 represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity as well as the removal from eids accrued remediation liabilities of obligations that have been fully transferred to chemours and dupont pursuant to the chemours separation agreement and subsequent mou and the corteva separation agreement as discussed in note 5  divestitures and other transactions and note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements eid is indemnified by chemours and dupont for certain environmental matters 

considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and under adverse changes in circumstances the potential liability may range up to 620 million above the amount accrued as of december 31 2020 however based on existing facts and circumstances management does not believe that any loss in excess of amounts accrued related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position liquidity or results of operations of the company 

the above noted 329 million accrued obligations includes the following 



1 represents liabilities that are subject to the 200 million thresholds and sharing arrangements as discussed on page f51 under corteva separation agreement 

2 the company has recorded an indemnification asset related to these accruals including 30 million related to the superfund sites 

3 accrual balance represents management’s best estimate of the costs of remediation and restoration although it is reasonably possible that the potential exposure as indicated could range above the amounts accrued as there are inherent uncertainties in these estimates 

4 accrual balance excludes indemnification liabilities of 39 million to chemours related to the cost sharing arrangement under the mou see page f27 

as of december 31 2020 the company has been notified of potential liability under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the us including approximately 130 sites for which the company does not believe it has liability based on current information active remediation is under way at 70 of the 500 sites in addition the company has resolved its liability at approximately 210 sites either by completing remedial actions with other prps or by participating in de minimis buyouts with other prps whose

waste like the companys represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site the company received notice of potential liability at 2 new sites during 2018 there were no new notices in 2019 or 2020 

environmental capital expenditures 

capital expenditures for environmental projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals were approximately 5 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the company currently estimates expenditures for environmentalrelated capital projects to be approximately 11 million in 2021 

climate change 

the company believes that climate change is an important global environmental concern that presents risks and opportunities the board of directors maintains oversight of these risks and opportunities management regularly assesses and manages climaterelated issues across its business individuals who are responsible for climaterelated initiatives may have annual performance goals tied to the delivery of projects related to these initiatives 

continuing political and social attention to climate change and its impacts has resulted in regulatory and marketbased approaches to limit greenhouse gas emissions the company believes there is a way forward for sustainable climate change mitigation that both enables farmers to meet the demands of a growing population and secures the economic future for the vast majority of the world’s population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods 

extreme and volatile weather due to climate change may have an adverse impact on customers’ ability to use the companys products potentially reducing sales volumes revenues and margins the company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of climatesmart agriculture and mitigate the impact of extreme and volatile weather the company integrates processes for identifying assessing and managing climaterelated risk into its overall risk management 

the company completed a nonfinancial materiality assessment and identified short medium and longterm climaterelated risks and opportunities the results of this assessment are integrated into the companys businesses strategy and financial planning and are presented in the 14 tenyear sustainability goals that were set in 2020 for each goal the company established key performance indicators and criteria to achieve the goals which are provided on the companys website at httpswwwcortevacomsustainabilityhtml the information contained on the company’s website is not part of nor incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k or the company’s other sec filings 

as demonstrated by the goals corteva is working to shrink its role in the emission of greenhouse gasses while enabling a more resilient agriculture value chain corteva will establish a climate strategy including appropriate scopes 1 2 and 3 greenhouse gas reduction targets by june 2021 the company is seeking ways to reduce its impact and providing tools and incentives for customers to do the same corteva champions climate positive agriculture utilizing carbon storage and other means to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits without sacrificing farmer productivity or ongoing profitability 

the company is committed to engaging with multiple stakeholders and partners around the globe who have innovative and actionable ideas to help safeguard the health and wellbeing of the planet and its people by doing more to address climate change today the company is fortifying its ability to grow food grow progress and build a sustainable industry that will help humanity thrive for generations to come

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates the company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results in the ordinary course of business the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls for additional information on these derivatives and related exposures see note 22  financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a casebycase basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure market volatility and economic trends foreign currency exchange contracts may be used from time to time to manage nearterm foreign currency cash requirements 

foreign currency exchange rate risks 

the company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales purchases investments and borrowings the primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the brazilian real swiss franc european euro eur and canadian dollar the company uses foreign exchange contracts to offset its net exposures by currency related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations the company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the companys exposure to certain forecasted transactions investment in foreign subsidiaries as well as the translation of foreign currencydenominated earnings and uses commodity contracts to offset risks associated with foreign currency devaluation in certain countries in addition to the contracts disclosed in note 22  financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements from time to time the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar usd amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 

certain foreign entities of the company held usd denominated marketable securities mainly us government securities at december 31 2020 the usdeur was the primary foreign exchange exposure for these nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities these marketable securities were classified as availableforsale and as such fluctuations in foreign exchange were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl within the consolidated statements of equity these fluctuations are subsequently reclassified from aocl to earnings in the period in which the marketable securities are sold 

the following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at december 31 2020 and 2019 and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at december 31 2020 and 2019 the sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates 



since the companys risk management programs are highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

concentration of credit risk 

the company maintains cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions these financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution 

as part of the companys financial risk management processes it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service corteva and monitors actual exposures versus established limits the company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions 

the companys sales are not materially dependent on any single customer credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic industry and customer diversity associated with the companys global product lines

distribution 

the seed segment has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the company’s brands to customers primarily through the company’s multichannel multibrand strategy which includes four differentiated channels pioneer agency model regional brands retail brands as well as third parties through licensing and distribution channels 

part i 

item 1 business continued 

the pioneer agency model is unique to corteva and represents sales made directly to farmers via independent sales representatives through this agency model the company interacts directly with farmers at multiple points in the growing season from prior to planting all the way through harvest these regular interactions enable the company to provide the advice and service farmers need while giving the company realtime insights into the customers’ future ordering decisions the company’s regional brands connect to customers through regional brand employees and farmerdealer networks retail brands provide a onestop shop for seed and chemistry solutions and may include sales to distributors agricultural cooperatives and dealers finally corteva outlicenses traits and germplasm to third parties 

key raw materials 

the key raw materials for seed include corn and soybean seeds to produce highquality seeds the company contracts with third party growers globally corteva focuses on production close to the customer to ensure the seed product is suitable for that region and its weed insect and disease challenges weather soil and other conditions the company conditions and packages the seeds using its own plants and thirdparty contract manufacturers by striking a balance between owning production facility assets directly and contracting with third party growers the company believes it is best able to maintain flexibility to react to demand changes unique to each geography while minimizing costs the company seeks to collaborate with strategic seed growers and share its digital agronomy and product management knowledge with them the company’s thirdparty growers are an important part of its supply chain corteva provides them with rigorous training planning tools and access to a system that tests and advances products matched to specific geographic needs 

the company’s rd and supply chain groups work seamlessly to select and maintain product characteristics that enhance the quality of its seed products and solutions the company focuses on customerdriven innovation to deliver the best germplasm and trait technologies with its large sets of digitized data and its seed field management solution the company can manage its field operations efficiently and draw insights from data quickly and effectively this allows the company’s supply chain to react quickly to changing customer needs and provides rd with tremendous amounts of data to analyze and incorporate into resource allocation decisions the company continues to invest in and build capabilities that drive value via data digitization and analytics that enable it to create an even more responsive and efficient answer to customer needs

products and brands 

the crop protection segment’s major brands and technologies by key product line are listed below 



key raw materials 

the key raw materials and supplies for crop protection include chlorinated pyridines derivatives specialty intermediates and technical grade active ingredients chlorine and seed treatments typically the company purchases major raw materials through longterm contracts with multiple suppliers which sometimes require minimum purchase commitments certain important raw materials are supplied by a few major suppliers the company expects the markets for its raw materials to remain balanced though pricing may be volatile given the current state of the global economy the company relies on contract manufacturers both domestically and internationally to produce certain inputs or key components for its product formulations these inputs are typically sourced close to where the company ultimately formulates and sells its products the company strives to maintain multiple highquality supply sources for each input 

corteva’s supply chain strategy will involve managing global supplies of active and intermediate ingredients sourced regionally with global best practices and oversight corteva’s supply strategy includes a robust and flexible global footprint to meet future portfolio growth the company’s supply chain also provides competitive advantages including reducing time to meet customer requirements in regions while minimizing costs through the value chain 

seasonality 

corteva’s sales are generally strongest in the first half of the calendar year which aligns with the planting and growing season in the northern hemisphere the company typically generates about 65 percent of its sales in the first half of the calendar year driven by northern hemisphere seed and crop protection sales the company generates about 35 percent of its sales in the second half of the calendar year led by seed sales in the southern hemisphere the seasonality in sales impacts both the seed and crop protection segments the company’s direct distribution channel where products are shipped to farmers is more affected by planting delays than its competitors generally speaking unfavorable weather slows the planting season and can affect the company’s quarterly results and sales mix severe unfavorable weather however can impact overall sales accounts receivable tends to be higher during the first half of the year consistent with the peak sales period in the northern hemisphere with cash collection focused in the fourth quarter

intellectual property 

corteva considers its intellectual property estate which includes patents trade secrets trademarks and copyrights in the aggregate to constitute a valuable asset of corteva and actively seeks to secure intellectual property rights as part of an overall strategy to protect its investment in innovations and maximize the results of its research and development program while the company believes that its intellectual property estate taken as a whole provides a competitive advantage in many of its businesses no single patent trademark license or group of related patents or licenses is in itself essential to the company as a whole or to any of the company’s segments 

trade secrets are an important element of the companys intellectual property many of the processes used to make corteva products are kept as trade secrets which from time to time may be licensed to third parties corteva vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets when the company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action as appropriate in addition the company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact which may include civil actions seeking redress restitution andor damages based on loss to the company andor unjust enrichment 

patents  trademarks corteva continually applies for and obtains us and foreign patents and has access to a large patent portfolio both owned and licensed corteva’s rights under these patents and licenses as well as the products made and sold under them are important to the company in the aggregate the protection afforded by these patents varies based on country scope of individual patent coverage as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country this significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the company’s strategic priorities within and across product lines at december 31 2019 the company owned about 5200 us patents and about 9200 active patents outside of the us 

remaining life of granted patents owned as of december 31 2019 



in addition to its owned patents the company owns over 7100 patent applications 

the company also owns or has licensed a substantial number of tradenames trademarks and trademark registrations in the united states and other countries including over 12100 registrations and pending trademark applications in a number of jurisdictions 

in addition the company holds multiple longterm biotechnology trait licenses from third parties as a normal course of business most corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits licensed from third parties under these longterm licenses 

competition 

the company competes with producers of seed germplasm trait developers and crop protection products on a global basis the global market for products within the industry is highly competitive and the company believes competition has and will continue to intensify with industry consolidation corteva competes based on germplasm and trait leadership price quality and cost competitiveness and the offering of a holistic solution the company’s key competitors include basf bayer fmc and chemchina as well as companies trading in generic crop protection chemicals and regional seed companies

 item 1a risk factors 

the successful development and commercialization of corteva’s pipeline products including enlist e3™ soybeans will be necessary for corteva’s growth 

corteva uses advanced breeding technologies to produce hybrids and varieties with superior performance in farmers’ fields and uses biotechnology to introduce traits that enhance specific characteristics of its crops corteva also uses advanced analytics software tools mobile communications and new planting and monitoring equipment to provide agronomic recommendations to growers additionally corteva conducts research into biological and chemical products to protect farmers’ crops from pests and diseases and enhance plant productivity 

new product concepts may be abandoned for many reasons including greater anticipated development costs technical difficulties lack of efficacy regulatory obstacles or inability to market under regulatory frameworks competition inability to prove the original concept lack of demand and the need to divert focus from time to time to other initiatives with perceived opportunities for better returns the processes of active ingredient development or discovery breeding biotechnology trait discovery and development and trait integration are lengthy and a very small percentage of the chemicals genes and germplasm corteva tests is selected for commercialization furthermore the length of time and the risk associated with the breeding and biotech pipelines are interlinked because both are required as a package for commercial success in markets where biotech traits are approved for growers for example the transition to the company’s enlist e3™ soybean technology is expected to take five years and is packaged with its enlist one ® and enlist duo ® herbicides in countries where biotech traits are not approved for widespread use corteva’s seed sales depend on the quality of its germplasm while initial commercialization efforts have been promising there are no guarantees that anticipated levels of product acceptability within cortevas markets will be achieved or that higher quality products will not be developed by cortevas competitors in the future 

speed in discovering developing protecting and responding to new technologies including new technologybased distribution channels that could facilitate corteva’s ability to engage with customers and end users and bringing related products to market is a significant competitive advantage commercial success frequently depends on being the first company to the market and many of corteva’s competitors are also making considerable investments in similar new biotechnology products improved germplasm products biological and chemical products and agronomic recommendation products 

corteva participates in an industry that is highly competitive and has undergone consolidation which could increase competitive pressures 

corteva currently faces significant competition in the markets in which it operates in most segments of the market the number of products available to the grower is steadily increasing as new products are introduced at the same time certain products are coming off patent and are thus available to generic manufacturers for production and commercialization additionally data analytic tools and webbased new direct purchase models offer increased transparency and comparability which creates price pressures corteva cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of its competitors aggressive marketing or pricing by corteva’s competitors could adversely affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial conditions as a result corteva continues to face significant competitive challenges 

  

corteva may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of its products including its seed and crop protection products which could restrict its ability to sell those products in some markets 

regulatory and legislative requirements affect the development manufacture and distribution of corteva’s products including the testing and planting of seeds containing corteva’s biotechnology traits and the import of crops grown from those seeds and noncompliance can harm corteva’s sales and profitability 

seed products incorporating biotechnology derived traits and crop protection products must be extensively tested for safety efficacy and environmental impact before they can be registered for production use sale or commercialization in a given market in certain jurisdictions corteva must periodically renew its approvals for both biotechnology and crop protection products which typically require corteva to demonstrate compliance with thencurrent standards which generally are more stringent since the prior registration the regulatory approvals process is lengthy costly complex and in some markets unpredictable with requirements that can vary by product technology industry and country the regulatory approvals process for products that incorporate novel modes of action or new technologies can be particularly unpredictable and uncertain due to the thencurrent state of regulatory guidelines and objectives as well as governmental policy considerations and nongovernmental organization and other stakeholder considerations 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

furthermore the detection of biotechnology traits or chemical residues from a crop protection product not approved in the country in which corteva sells or cultivates its product or in a country to which corteva imports its product may affect corteva’s ability to supply its products or export its products or even result in crop destruction product recalls or trade disruption which could result in lawsuits and termination of licenses related to biotechnology traits and raw material supply agreements delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to import including those related to the importation of crops grown from seeds containing certain traits or treated with specific chemicals may influence the rate of adoption of new products in globally traded crops 

additionally the regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of nongovernmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reaction to actual or perceived impacts of new and existing technology products or processes on safety health and the environment obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data which may require participation from technology providers regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing in addition corteva has seen an increase in recent years in the number of lawsuits filed by those who identify themselves as public or environmental interest groups seeking to invalidate pesticide product registrations andor challenge the way federal or state governmental entities apply the rules and regulations governing pesticide produce use the pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance responding to these changes and meeting existing and new requirements may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability the failure to receive necessary permits or approvals could have near and longterm effects on corteva’s ability to produce and sell some current and future products 

  

enforcing corteva’s intellectual property rights or defending against intellectual property claims asserted by others could materially affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

intellectual property rights including patents plant variety protection trade secrets confidential information trademarks tradenames and other forms of trade dress are important to corteva’s business corteva endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights in jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported however corteva may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual property in key jurisdictions further changes in government policies and regulations including changes made in reaction to pressure from nongovernmental organizations or the public generally could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions 

corteva has designed and implemented internal controls to restrict use of access to and distribution of its intellectual property despite these precautions corteva’s intellectual property is vulnerable to infringement misappropriation and other unauthorized access including through employee or licensee error or actions theft and cybersecurity incidents and other security breaches when unauthorized access and use or counterfeit products are discovered corteva reports such situations to governmental authorities for investigation as appropriate and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be selfreplicating 

competitors are increasingly challenging intellectual property positions and the outcomes can be highly uncertain third parties may claim corteva’s products violate their intellectual property rights defending such claims even those without merit could be timeconsuming and expensive in addition any such claim could result in corteva’s having to enter into license agreements develop noninfringing products or engage in litigation that could be costly if challenges are resolved adversely it could negatively impact corteva’s ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms develop and commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products 

  

in addition because of the rapid pace of technological change the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions andor the uncertainty in predicting the outcome of complex proceedings relating to ownership and the scope of patents relating to certain emerging technologies competitors may be issued patents related to corteva’s business unexpectedly these patents could reduce the value of corteva’s commercial or pipeline products or to the extent they cover key technologies on which corteva has relied require corteva to seek to obtain licenses and corteva cannot ensure it would be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or cease using the technology no matter how valuable to corteva’s business 

legislation and jurisprudence on patent protection is evolving and changes in laws could affect corteva’s ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for and otherwise enforce corteva’s patents related to its products 

  

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

corteva’s business may be materially affected by competition from manufacturers of generic products 

competition from manufacturers of generic products is a challenge for corteva’s branded products around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on corteva’s revenues the date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of corteva’s products or of a product that corteva licenses or upon the “atrisk” launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of corteva’s patented products or of a product that corteva licenses corteva can lose a major portion of revenues for that product which can have a material adverse effect on corteva’s business 

  

corteva is dependent on its relationships or contracts with third parties with respect to certain of its raw materials or licenses and commercialization 

corteva is dependent on third parties in the research development and commercialization of its products and enters into transactions including but not limited to supply agreements and licensing agreements in connection with corteva’s business the majority of corteva’s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits that corteva licenses from third parties under longterm licenses if corteva loses its rights under such licenses it could negatively impact corteva’s ability to obtain future licenses on competitive terms commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products to maintain such licenses corteva may elect to outlicense its technology including germplasm there can be no guarantee that such outlicensing will not ultimately strengthen corteva’s competition thereby adversely impacting corteva’s results of operations 

while corteva relies heavily on third parties for multiple aspects of its business and commercialization activities corteva does not control many aspects of such third parties’ activities third parties may not complete activities on schedule or in accordance with corteva’s expectations failure by one or more of these third parties to meet their contractual or other obligations to corteva or to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any disruption in the relationship between corteva and one or more of these third parties could delay or prevent the development approval or commercialization of corteva’s products and could also result in noncompliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implications for corteva’s business 

in addition corteva’s agreements with third parties may obligate it to meet certain contractual or other obligations to third parties for example corteva may be obligated to meet certain thresholds or abide by certain boundary conditions if corteva were to fail to meet such obligations to the third parties its relationship with such third parties may be disrupted such a disruption could negatively impact certain of corteva’s licenses on which it depends could cause reputational harm and could negatively affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations substantial civil or criminal sanctions as well as the assessment of strict liability andor joint and several liability 

corteva is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws regulations rules and ordinances relating to pollution protection of the environment waste water discharges the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials and the use of genetically modified seeds and crop protection active ingredients by growers 

environmental and health and safety laws regulations and standards expose corteva to the risk of substantial costs and liabilities including liabilities associated with corteva’s business and the discontinued and divested businesses and operations of eid as is typical for businesses like corteva’s soil and groundwater contamination has occurred in the past at certain sites and may be identified at other sites in the future disposal of waste from corteva’s business at offsite locations also exposes it to potential remediation costs consistent with past practice corteva is continuing to monitor investigate and remediate soil and groundwater contamination at several of these sites 

  

costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements moreover changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt corteva’s operations or require modifications to its facilities accordingly environmental health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities which may be materially higher than corteva’s accruals

item 1a risk factors continued 

  

the degree of public understanding and acceptance or perceived public acceptance of corteva’s biotechnology and other agricultural products and technologies can affect corteva’s sales and results of operations by affecting planting approvals regulatory requirements and customer purchase decisions 

concerns and claims regarding the safe use of seeds with biotechnology traits and crop protection products in general their potential impact on health and the environment and the perceived impacts of biotechnology on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection these include concerns and claims that increased use of crop protection products drift inversion volatilization and the use of biotechnology traits meant to reduce the resistance of weeds or pests to control by crop protection products could increase or accelerate such resistance and otherwise negatively impact health and the environment these and other concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals preferred purchasing delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals delayed product launches lack of market acceptance product discontinuation continued pressure for and adoption of more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation termination of raw material supply agreements and legal claims these and other concerns could also influence public perceptions the viability or continued sales of certain of corteva’s products corteva’s reputation and the cost to comply with regulations as a result such concerns could have a material adverse effect corteva’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

changes in agricultural and related policies of governments and international organizations may prove unfavorable 

in many markets there are various pressures to reduce government subsidies to farmers which may inhibit the growth in these markets of products used in agriculture in addition government programs that create incentives for farmers for example the us renewable fuel standard may be modified or discontinued however it is difficult to predict accurately whether and if so when such changes will occur corteva expects that the policies of governments and international organizations will continue to affect the planting choices made by growers as well as the income available to growers to purchase products used in agriculture and accordingly the operating results of the agriculture industry 

  

corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by industrial espionage and other disruptions to its supply chain information technology or network systems 

business andor supply chain disruptions plant andor power outages and information technology system andor network disruptions regardless of cause including acts of sabotage employee error or other actions geopolitical activity local epidemics or pandemics weather events and natural disasters could seriously harm corteva’s operations as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers for example a pandemic in locations where corteva has significant operations sales or key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on corteva’s results of operations in addition terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased stakeholder concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution 

business andor supply chain disruptions may also be caused by security breaches which could include for example attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers viruses breaches due to employee error or actions or other disruptions corteva andor its suppliers may fail to effectively prevent detect and recover from these or other security breaches and as a consequence such breaches could result in misuse of corteva’s assets business disruptions loss of property including trade secrets and confidential business information legal claims or proceedings reporting errors processing inefficiencies negative media attention loss of sales and interference with regulatory compliance 

like most major corporations corteva is the target of industrial espionage including cyberattacks from time to time corteva has determined that these incidents have resulted and could result in the future in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information however to date corteva has not experienced any material financial impact changes in the competitive environment or impact on business operations from these events although management does not believe that corteva has experienced any material losses to date related to industrial espionage and security breaches including cybersecurity incidents there can be no assurance that corteva will not suffer such losses in the future 

corteva actively manages the risks within its control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches as these threats continue to evolve particularly around cybersecurity corteva may be required to expend significant resources to enhance its control environment processes practices and other protective measures despite these efforts such events could have a material adverse effect on corteva’s business financial condition or results of operations

item 1a risk factors continued 

corteva’s sales to its customers may be adversely affected should a company successfully establish an intermediary platform for the sale of corteva’s products or otherwise position itself between corteva and its customers 

corteva expects its distribution model will service customers primarily through the pioneer direct sales channel in key agricultural geographies including the united states in addition corteva expects to supplement this approach with strong retail channels including distributors agricultural cooperatives and dealers and with digital solutions that assist farmer decisionmaking with a view to optimize their product selection and maximize their yield and profitability while corteva expects the indirect channels and its digital platform will extend its reach and increase exposure of its products to other potential customers including smaller farmers or farmers in less concentrated areas there can be no assurance that corteva will be successful in this regard if a competitor were to successfully establish an intermediary platform for distribution of corteva’s products especially with respect to corteva’s digital platform it may disrupt corteva’s distribution model and inhibit corteva’s ability to provide a complete gotomarket strategy covering the direct dealer and retail channels in such a circumstance corteva’s sales may be adversely affected 

  

volatility in corteva’s input costs which include raw materials and production costs could have a significant impact on corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

corteva’s input costs are variable based on the costs associated with production or with raw materials corteva uses for example corteva’s production costs vary especially on a seasonal basis where changes in weather influence supply and demand in addition corteva’s manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of raw materials the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond corteva’s control corteva refers to these costs collectively as input costs significant variations in input costs affect corteva’s operating results from period to period 

when possible corteva purchases raw materials through negotiated longterm contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations corteva also enters into overthecounter and exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases in addition corteva takes actions to offset the effects of higher input costs through selling price increases productivity improvements and cost reduction programs success in offsetting higher input costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served if corteva is not able to fully offset the effects of higher input costs it could have a significant impact on its financial results 

  

corteva may be unable to achieve all the benefits that it expects to achieve from the internal reorganization and future restructuring and other cost savings initiatives combining the agriculture businesses of eid and das may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected which may adversely affect corteva’s results and negatively affect the value of corteva common stock 

since the merger corteva has benefited from and expects to continue to benefit from significant cost synergies through the dowdupont cost synergy program the “synergy program” which was designed to integrate and optimize the organization in preparation for the separation of dowdupont’s materials science business through the separation and distribution of dow which occurred on april 1 2019 and the separation of dowdupont’s agriculture business through corteva’s separation and distribution which occurred on june 1 2019 this integration and optimization was designed to be achieved through production cost efficiencies enhancement of the agricultural supply chain elimination of duplicative agricultural research and development programs optimization of corteva’s global footprint across manufacturing sales and research and development the reduction of corporate and leveraged services costs and the realization of significant procurement synergies in addition corteva’s management also expects corteva will achieve growth synergies and other meaningful savings and benefits as a result of corteva’s separation as well as any future restructuring or cost savings initiatives 

combining eid and dass independent agriculture businesses and preparing for corteva’s separation and distribution were complex costly and timeconsuming processes and management may face significant challenges in implementing or realizing the expected synergies from corteva’s separation and distribution many of which may be beyond the control of management including without limitation

some of these factors are outside of corteva’s control and any one of them could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy as well as decreases in the amount of expected revenue which could materially impact corteva’s business financial condition and results of operations 

if the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the synergy program or other future restructurings or cost initiatives are not realized fully or take longer to realize than expected the value of corteva’s common stock revenues levels of expenses and results of operations may be affected adversely there can be no assurance that corteva as an independent separate public company will be able to sustain any or all the cost savings generated from actions under the synergy program or through future restructurings or cost initiatives 

  

corteva’s liquidity business results of operations and financial condition could be impaired if it is unable to raise capital through the capital markets or shortterm debt borrowings 

any limitation on corteva’s ability to raise money in the capital markets or through shortterm debt borrowings could have a substantial negative effect on corteva’s liquidity corteva’s ability to affordably access the capital markets andor borrow shortterm debt in amounts adequate to finance its activities could be impaired as a result of a variety of factors including factors that are not specific to corteva such as a severe disruption of the financial markets and in the case of debt securities or borrowings interest rate fluctuations due to the seasonality of corteva’s business and the credit programs corteva may offer its customers net working capital investment and corresponding debt levels will fluctuate over the course of the year 

corteva regularly extends credit to its customers to enable them to purchase seeds or crop protection products at the beginning of the growing season the customer receivables may be used as collateral for shortterm financing programs any material adverse effect upon corteva’s ability to own or sell such customer receivables including seasonal factors that may impact the amount of customer receivables corteva owns may materially impact corteva’s access to capital 

corteva has additional agreements with financial institutions to establish programs that provide financing for select customers of corteva’s seed and crop protection products in the united states latin america europe and asia the programs are renewed on an annual basis in most cases corteva guarantees the extension of such credit to such customers if corteva is unable to renew these agreements or access the debt markets to support customer financing corteva’s sales may be negatively impacted which could result in increased borrowing needs to fund working capital 

corteva’s earnings operations and business among other things will impact its credit ratings costs and availability of financing a decrease in the ratings assigned to corteva or eid by the ratings agencies may negatively impact corteva’s access to the debt capital markets and increase corteva’s cost of borrowing and the financing of its seasonal working capital 

part i 

item 1a risk factors continued 

there can be no assurance that corteva or eid will maintain its current or prospective credit ratings any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit ratings may have a negative impact on corteva’s liquidity capital position or access to capital markets 

  

corteva’s customers may be unable to pay their debts to corteva which could adversely affect corteva’s results 

corteva offers its customers financing programs with credit terms generally less than one year from invoicing in alignment with the growing season due to these credit practices as well as the seasonality of corteva’s operations corteva may need to issue shortterm debt at certain times of the year to fund its cash flow requirements corteva’s customers may be exposed to a variety of conditions that could adversely affect their ability to pay their debts for example customers in economies experiencing an economic downturn or in a region experiencing adverse growing conditions may be unable to repay their obligations to corteva which could adversely affect corteva’s results 

increases in pension and other postemployment benefit plan funding obligations may adversely affect corteva’s results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

through cortevas ownership of eid corteva maintains eid defined benefit pension and other postemployment benefit plans for some of these plans including eid’s principal us pension plan corteva continues as sponsor for the entire plan regardless of whether participants including retirees are or were associated with eid’s agriculture business corteva uses many assumptions in calculating its expected future payment obligations under these plans significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than assumed in addition expected future payment obligations may be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions regarding participants including retirees in 2020 corteva expects to contribute approximately 60 million to its pension plans other than the principal us pension plan and about 240 million for its other postemployment benefit opeb plans additionally corteva may make potential discretionary contributions to the principal us pension plan in 2020 corteva furthermore may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future which could adversely affect corteva’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

  

corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by environmental litigation and other commitments and contingencies 

as a result of corteva’s operations including past operations and those related to divested businesses and discontinued operations of eid corteva incurs environmental operating costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment emissions testing and monitoring and obtaining permits corteva also incurs environmental operating costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials in addition corteva maintains and periodically reviews and adjusts its accruals for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs 

corteva expects to continue to incur environmental operating costs since it will operate global manufacturing product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations these rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency which corteva monitors closely corteva’s policy will require that its operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements in addition corteva expects to continue certain voluntary programs and could consider additional voluntary actions to reduce air emissions minimize the generation of hazardous waste decrease the volume of water use and discharges increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent bioaccumulative and toxic materials costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs and goals are significant and corteva expects these costs will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future over the long term such expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and could fluctuate significantly 

corteva accrues for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated as remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs corteva expects to base such estimates on several factors including the complexity of the geology the nature and extent of contamination the type of remedy the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties “prps” at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other prps considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and under adverse changes in circumstances the potential liability may be materially higher than corteva’s accruals

corteva faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters arising out of the normal course of its current and former business operations including intellectual property commercial product liability environmental and antitrust lawsuits corteva has noted a trend in public and private suits being filed on behalf of states counties cities and utilities alleging harm to the general public and the environment including waterways and watersheds claims alleging harm to the public and the environment may be brought against corteva notwithstanding years of scientific evidence and regulatory determinations supporting the safety of crop protection products the litigation involving monsanto’s roundup ® nonselective glyphosate containing weedkiller products has resulted in negative publicity and sentiment and may lead to similar suits with respect to glyphosatecontaining products andor other established crop protection products claims and allegations that corteva’s products or products that corteva manufactures or markets on behalf of third parties are not safe could result in litigation damage to corteva’s reputation and have a material adverse effect on corteva’s business it is not possible to predict the outcome of these various proceedings an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to corteva’s financial results various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such factors and developments may include but are not limited to additional data safety or risk assessments as well as a final adverse judgment significant settlement or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on corteva 

the company pursuant to the chemours separation agreement and the corteva separation agreement is entitled to indemnification from chemours dow and dupont as applicable for certain litigation environmental workers’ compensation and other liabilities related to its historical operations in connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters corteva records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable these estimates of recovery are subject to various factors and developments that could result in differences from future estimates or the actual recovery as of december 31 2019 the indemnification assets pursuant to the chemours separation agreement and the corteva separation agreement are in aggregate 120 million within accounts and notes receivable  net and 359 million within other assets in the company’s consolidated balance sheet any failure by or inability to pay these liabilities in line with the indemnification provisions of the separation agreements may have a material adverse effect on corteva and its financial condition and results of operations 

in the ordinary course of business corteva may make certain commitments including representations warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations including those related to divested businesses and issue guarantees of third party obligations if corteva were required to make payments as a result they could exceed the amounts accrued thereby adversely affecting corteva’s financial condition and results of operations 

corteva’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks and restrictions which could negatively affect corteva’s business results of operations and financial condition 

corteva’s operations outside the united states are subject to risks and restrictions including fluctuations in foreigncurrency exchange rates exchange control regulations changes in local political or economic conditions import and trade restrictions import or export licensing requirements and trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad in addition corteva’s international operations are sometimes in countries with unstable governments economic or fiscal challenges military or political conflicts local epidemics or pandemics significant levels of crime and organized crime or developing legal systems this may increase the risk to the companys employees subcontractors or other parties and to other liabilities such as property loss or damage to the companys products and may affect cortevas ability to safely operate in or import into or receive raw materials from these countries for example in december 2019 a strain of coronavirus reported to have surfaced in wuhan china slowed international commerce with china while at this point the extent to which the coronavirus may impact the companys results is uncertain it may result in delays in receiving key raw materials for the companys products or decreased demand for the companys products which may negatively impact cortevas business 

additionally corteva’s ability to export its products and its sales outside the united states has been and may continue to be adversely affected by significant changes in trade tax or other policies including the risk that other countries may retaliate through the imposition of their own trade restrictions andor increased tariffs in response to substantial changes to us trade and tax policies

item 1a risk factors continued 

although corteva has operations throughout the world corteva’s sales outside the united states in 2019 were principally to customers in brazil eurozone countries and canada further corteva’s largest currency exposures are the euro and the brazilian real market uncertainty or an economic downturn in these geographic areas could reduce demand for corteva’s products and result in decreased sales volume which could have a negative impact on corteva’s results of operations in addition changes in exchange rates may affect corteva’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods corteva actively manages currency exposures that are associated with net monetary asset positions and committed purchases 

climate change and unpredictable seasonal and weather factors could impact corteva’s sales and earnings 

the agriculture industry is subject to seasonal and weather factors which can vary unpredictably from period to period weather factors can affect the presence of disease and pests on a regional basis and accordingly can positively or adversely affect the demand for crop protection products including the mix of products used or the level of returns the weather also can affect the quality volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix seed yields can be higher or lower than planned which could lead to higher inventory and related writeoffs climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of extreme weather such as storms floods heat waves droughts and other events that could affect the quality volume and cost of seed produced for sale as well as demand and product mix climate change may also affect the availability and suitability of arable land and contribute to unpredictable shifts in the average growing season and types of crops produced 

corteva’s business may be adversely affected by the availability of counterfeit products 

a counterfeit product is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source a counterfeit corteva product therefore is one manufactured by someone other than corteva but which appears to be the same as an authentic corteva product the prevalence of counterfeit products is a significant and growing industrywide issue due to a variety of factors including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which has greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit products can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual consumers the availability of sophisticated technology that makes it easier for counterfeiters to make counterfeit products and the relatively modest risk of penalties faced by counterfeiters compared to the large profits that can be earned by them from the sale of counterfeit products further laws against counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing laws varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some countries counterfeiting is not a crime in others it may result in only minimal sanctions in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit products use complex transport routes to evade customs controls by disguising the true source of their products 

corteva’s global reputation makes its products prime targets for counterfeiting organizations counterfeit products pose a risk to consumer health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary sites as well as the lack of regulation of their contents failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit products which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain could adversely impact corteva’s business by among other things causing the loss of consumer confidence in corteva’s name and in the integrity of its products potentially resulting in lost sales and an increased threat of litigation 

corteva undertakes significant efforts to counteract the threats associated with counterfeit products including among other things working with regulatory authorities and multinational coalitions to combat the counterfeiting of products and supporting efforts by law enforcement authorities to prosecute counterfeiters assessing new and existing technologies to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to copy corteva’s products and easier for consumers to distinguish authentic from counterfeit products working diligently to raise public awareness about the dangers of counterfeit products working collaboratively with wholesalers customs offices and law enforcement agencies to increase inspection coverage monitor distribution channels and improve surveillance of distributors and working with other members of an international trade association of agrochemical companies to promote initiatives to combat counterfeiting activity no assurance can be given however that corteva’s efforts and the efforts of others will be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit products may continue to increase

failure to effectively manage acquisitions divestitures alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact corteva’s future results 

from time to time corteva evaluates acquisition candidates that may strategically fit corteva’s business andor growth objectives if corteva is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses corteva could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increases in revenues and operating results which could have a material adverse effect on corteva’s financial results corteva continually reviews its portfolio of assets for contributions to its objectives and alignment with its growth strategy however corteva may not be successful in separating underperforming or nonstrategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of or lost operating income from such assets may affect corteva’s earnings moreover corteva might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce its earnings in addition if the execution or implementation of acquisitions divestitures alliances joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful it could adversely impact corteva’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

  

an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could require corteva to record a significant noncash charge and negatively impact corteva’s financial results 

corteva assesses both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value for the seed reporting unit the excess fair value over carrying value is approximately 12 and therefore carries a higher risk of impairment charges in future periods future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could be recorded as a noncash charge in results of operations due to changes in assumption estimates or circumstances and there can be no assurance that such impairments would be immaterial to corteva 

risks related to the separation 

the company may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that it expected to achieve from the separation from dowdupont 

as an independent publiclytraded company corteva continues to among other things focus its financial and operational resources on its specific business growth profile and strategic priorities design and implement corporate strategies and policies targeted to its operational focus and strategic priorities guide its processes and infrastructure to focus on its core strengths implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet its specific needs and more effectively respond to industry dynamics all of which are benefits the company expected to achieve from its separation however the company may be unable to fully achieve some or all of these benefits 

for example in order to position itself for the separation and distribution the company undertook a series of strategic structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within its operations these actions may not provide the benefits the company expected and could lead to disruption of operations loss of or inability to recruit key personnel needed to operate and grow its businesses following the separation and distribution weakening of its internal standards controls or procedures and impairment of its key customer and supplier relationships if the company fails to achieve some or all of the benefits that it expected to achieve as an independent company or does not achieve them in the time expected its business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

in connection with the separation the company has assumed and agreed to indemnify dupont and dow for certain liabilities if the company is required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities the company may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and its financial results could be negatively impacted in addition dupont and dow will indemnify corteva for certain liabilities these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure the company against the full amount of liabilities it incurs and dupont andor dow andor their historical separated businesses may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation agreement the employee matters agreement and the tax matters agreement with dupont and dow the company agreed to assume and indemnify dupont and dow for certain liabilities for uncapped amounts which may include among other items associated defense costs settlement amounts and judgments as discussed further in note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements and part i  item 3  legal proceedings payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact the company’s business particularly indemnities relating to certain litigation for historical dupont operations or its actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the corteva distribution

third parties could also seek to hold the company responsible for any of the liabilities allocated to dupont and dow including those related to dowdupont’s specialty products andor materials science businesses respectively and those related to discontinued andor divested businesses and operations of historical dow which have been allocated to dow dupont andor dow as applicable will agree to indemnify corteva for such liabilities but such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect the company against the full amount of such liabilities in addition dupont andor dow as applicable may not be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations with respect to the liabilities the company incurs even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from dupont andor dow as applicable any amounts for which the company is held liable the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself each of these risks could negatively affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally the company generally has assumed and is responsible for the payment of its share of i certain liabilities of dowdupont relating to arising out of or resulting from certain general corporate matters of dowdupont ii certain liabilities of historical dupont relating to arising out of or resulting from general corporate matters of historical dupont and discontinued andor divested businesses and operations of historical dupont including its spinoff of chemours and iii certain separation expenses not otherwise allocated to dupont or dow or allocated specifically to corteva pursuant to the corteva separation agreement and third parties could seek to hold corteva responsible for dupont’s or dow’s share of any such liabilities for more information see note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements and part i  item 3  legal proceedings dupont andor dow as applicable will indemnify corteva for their share of any such liabilities however such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect corteva against the full amount of such liabilities andor dupont andor dow may not be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in addition even if the company ultimately succeeds in recovering from dupont andor dow any amounts for which the company is held liable in excess of its agreed share the company may be temporarily required to bear these losses itself and may not be able to fully insure itself to cover these risks each of these risks could materially affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the separation and related transactions may expose corteva to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws 

although the company received a solvency opinion from an investment bank confirming that the company and dupont were each adequately capitalized following the distribution the separation could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws in connection with fraudulent conveyances or transfers are generally defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent or that rendered the debtor insolvent inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due any unpaid creditor could claim that dupont did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the separation and corteva distribution and that the separation and corteva distribution left dupont insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that dupont intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured additionally under its indemnity provisions of the separation agreement the company could find its liabilities increased as a result of a court concluding that historical dupont historical dow or dowdupont executed a fraudulent conveyance in connection with divestitures and spinoffs of any one of their historical operations including chemours if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff then such court could void the separation and distribution as a fraudulent transfer or impose substantial liabilities on corteva which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations among other things the court could return some of corteva’s assets or shares of corteva common stock to dupont provide dupont with a claim for money damages against corteva in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by dupont and the fair market value of corteva at the time of the corteva distribution or require corteva to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the internal reorganization and business realignment for the benefit of creditors 

the distribution is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes under the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either i out of its surplus net assets minus capital or ii if there is no such surplus out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year although the distribution was made out of dowdupont’s surplus and the company received an opinion that dowdupont has adequate surplus under delaware law to declare the dividend of corteva common stock in connection with the corteva distribution there can be no assurance that a court will not later determine that some or all of the corteva distribution was unlawful

if the corteva distribution together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes then the company could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability and stockholders receiving corteva common stock in the corteva distribution could be subject to significant tax liability 

dowdupont received an irs tax ruling and tax opinion that among other things the corteva distribution and certain related transactions will qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 and section 368a1d of the internal revenue code the code the irs ruling and tax opinion will rely on certain facts assumptions and undertakings and certain representations from dowdupont and corteva regarding the past and future conduct of both respective businesses and other matters despite the tax opinion and the irs ruling the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion 

if the corteva distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable then a stockholder of dupont that received shares of corteva common stock would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares including any fractional shares sold on behalf of such stockholder on the distribution date and could incur significant income tax liabilities such distribution would be taxable to such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of dupont’s current and accumulated earnings and profits which would include any earnings and profits attributable to the gain recognized by dupont on the taxable distribution and could include earnings and profits attributable to certain internal transactions preceding the corteva distribution any amount that exceeded dupont’s earnings and profits would be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder’s tax basis in its shares of dupont stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a gain on the dupont stock in the event the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable dupont would recognize corporate level taxable gain on the distribution in an amount equal to the excess if any of the fair market value of corteva common stock distributed to dupont stockholders on the distribution date over dupont’s tax basis in such stock in addition if certain related transactions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment under us federal state local tax andor foreign tax law corteva and dupont could incur significant tax liabilities under us federal state local andor foreign tax law 

generally taxes resulting from the failure of the separation and distributions to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes would be imposed on dupont or dupont stockholders under the tax matters agreement that the company entered into with dupont and dow subject to the exceptions described below the company is generally obligated to indemnify dupont against such taxes imposed on dupont however if the distributions fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the merger and the distributions then under the tax matters agreement dupont and dow would share the tax liability resulting from such failure in accordance with their relative equity values on the first full trading day following the dow distribution the company and dupont would share any liabilities of dupont described in the preceding sentence in accordance with its relative equity values on the first full trading day following the corteva distribution furthermore under the terms of the tax matters agreement the company also generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on dupont or dow that arise from the failure of the corteva distribution to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to its or its affiliates’ stock assets or business or any breach of its representations made in any representation letter provided to its counsel in connection with the tax opinion dupont and dow will be separately responsible for any taxes imposed on corteva that arise from the failure of the corteva distribution to qualify as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of section 355 of the code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to such company’s or its affiliates’ stock assets or business or any breach of such company’s representations made in connection with the irs ruling or in the representation letter provided to counsel in connection with the tax opinion events triggering an indemnification obligation under the tax matters agreement include events occurring after the corteva distribution that cause dupont to recognize a gain under section 355e of the code as discussed further below such tax amounts could be significant to the extent that the company is responsible for any liability under the tax matters agreement there could be a material adverse impact on corteva’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods

the company agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the taxfree treatment of the transactions separating it from dowdupont in the united states which may reduce corteva’s strategic and operating flexibility 

the company’s ability to engage in certain transactions is limited or restricted to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distributions by dowdupont and certain aspects of the internal reorganization and business realignment as a result of these limitations under the tax matters agreement that the company entered into with dupont and dow for the twoyear period following the distribution the company is prohibited except in certain circumstances from among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

these restrictions may significantly limit corteva’s ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that the company may believe to otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders or that might increase the value of its business 

the irs may assert that the merger causes the distributions and other related transactions to be taxable to dupont in which case the company could be subject to significant indemnification liability 

even if the distributions otherwise constitutes a taxfree transaction to stockholders under section 355 of the code dupont may be required to recognize corporate level tax on the distributions and certain related transactions under section 355e of the code if as a result of the merger or other transactions considered part of a plan with the distributions there is a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in dupont or corteva in connection with the merger dowdupont received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the proper time manner and methodology for measuring common ownership in the stock of dowdupont historical dupont and historical dow for purposes of determining whether there has been a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under section 355e of the code as a result of the merger the tax opinion relied on the continued validity of the private letter ruling as well as certain factual representations from dowdupont as to the extent of common ownership in the stock of historical dupont and historical dow immediately prior to the merger based on the representations made by dowdupont as to the common ownership in the stock of historical dupont and historical dow immediately prior to the merger and assuming the continued validity of the irs ruling the tax opinion concluded that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership in dowdupont historical dupont or historical dow for purposes of section 355e as a result of the merger notwithstanding the tax opinion and the irs ruling the irs could determine that the distributions or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to dupont if it determines that any of the facts assumptions representations or undertakings of dowdupont is not correct or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons including if the irs were to disagree with the conclusions in the tax opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling if dupont is required to recognize corporate level tax on either of the distributions and certain related transactions under section 355e of the code then under the tax matters agreement the company may be required to indemnify dupont andor dow for all or a portion of such taxes which could be a material amount if such taxes were the result of either direct or indirect transfers of corteva common stock or certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the merger and the distributions

item 1a risk factors continued 

the company is subject to continuing contingent taxrelated liabilities of dowdupont following the distribution 

there are several significant areas where the liabilities of dowdupont may become corteva’s obligations either in whole or in part for example under the code and the related rules and regulations each corporation that was a member of dowdupont’s consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for such taxable period additionally to the extent that any subsidiary of corteva was included in the consolidated tax reporting group of either historical dupont or historical dow for any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the merger such subsidiary is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group of historical dupont or historical dow as applicable for such taxable period in connection with the distributions on april 1 2019 the company entered into the tax matters agreement with dupont and dow that allocates the responsibility for prior period consolidated taxes among corteva dupont and dow if dupont or dow were unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible however the company could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes and such amounts could be significant other provisions of federal state local or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters including laws governing taxqualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 

restrictions under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements limit corteva’s ability to develop and commercialize certain products and services andor prosecute maintain and enforce certain intellectual property 

the company is dependent to a certain extent on dupont and dow to maintain and enforce certain of the intellectual property licensed under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements for example dupont and dow are responsible for filing prosecuting and maintaining at their respective discretion patents on trade secrets and knowhow that they each respectively license to corteva they also have the first right to enforce their respective trade secrets and knowhow licensed to corteva if dupont or dow as applicable fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents trade secrets or knowhow under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements the company may not be able to prevent competitors from making using and selling competitive products and services 

in addition corteva’s use of the intellectual property licensed to it under the intellectual property crosslicense agreements is restricted to certain fields which could limit corteva’s ability to develop and commercialize certain products and services for example the licenses granted to corteva under the agreement will not extend to all fields of use that the company may decide to enter into in the future these restrictions may make it more difficult time consuming andor expensive for corteva to develop and commercialize certain new products and services or may result in certain of its products or services being later to market than those of its competitors

seed 

seed net sales were 7590 million in 2019 down from 7842 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a 2 percent decline in currency and a 1 percent decline in volume local price was flat 

unfavorable currency impacts were primarily due to the brazilian real eastern european currencies and the euro volume gains in corn in emea were more than offset by significant weatherrelated planting delays in north america leading to a reduction in planted area for soybeans and multichannel and multibrand rationalization impacts in north america competitive pricing pressure in soybeans in the us and increased soybean and corn replant in north america were offset by favorable mix and continued penetration of powercore ultra ® in latin america 

seed pro forma operating ebitda was 1040 million in 2019 down 9 percent from 1139 million in 2018 competitive pricing pressure the unfavorable impact of currency increased commissions and input costs and volume declines more than offset cost synergies and ongoing productivity 

seed net sales were 7842 million in 2018 1520 million for the period september 1 through december 31 2017 and 5865 million for the period january 1 through august 31 2017  pro forma net sales for the year ended december 31 2017 were 8056 million  the decrease in pro forma net sales was primarily due to a 3 percent decline in volume and a 1 percent decline in currency partially offset by a 1 percent increase in local price volume declines represented lower planted area in north america and latin america increases in local price and product mix were driven by continued penetration of new corn hybrids and aseries soybeans 

seed pro forma operating ebitda was 1139 million in 2018 down 3 percent from 1170 million in 2017 cost synergies were more than offset by lower volume higher raw material costs and royalty expense and investments to support new product launches and digital platforms

crop protection 

crop protection net sales were 6256 million in 2019 down from 6445 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to a 3 percent decline in currency and a 1 percent decline in portfolio partially offset by a 1 percent increase in volume local price was flat 

unfavorable currency impacts were primarily due to brazilian real and the euro volume gains driven by new product launches  including enlist tm and arylex tm herbicides and isoclast tm insecticide  were partially offset by the unfavorable weather in north america which resulted in lost spring applications pricing gains from new products launches were offset by increased grower incentive program discounts in north america the portfolio impact was driven by divestitures in north america and asia pacific 

crop protection pro forma operating ebitda was 1066 million in 2019 down 1 percent from 1074 million in 2018 volume declines in north america the unfavorable impact of currency and higher input costs more than offset cost synergies sales from new products and ongoing productivity 

crop protection net sales were 6445 million in 2018 2270 million for the period september 1 through december 31 2017 and 1029 million for the period january 1 through august 31 2017  pro forma net sales for the year ended december 31 2017 were 6185 million  the increase in pro forma net sales was primarily due to a 3 percent increase in volume and a 3 percent increase in local price partially offset by a 2 percent decline in currency volume gains were driven by new product launches such as vessarya tm fungicides enlist tm products and isoclast tm  pyraxalt™ and spinosyn™ insecticides and were partly offset by lower demand for nitrogen stabilizers in north america and currency pressures in latin america increases in local prices were driven by continuing efforts to capture value in established brands across the crop protection portfolio globally 

crop protection pro forma operating ebitda was 1074 million in 2018 up 15 percent from 936 million in 2017 cost synergies and sales gains from new product launches were partially offset by growth investments including for new product launches higher raw material costs and the unfavorable impact of currency

critical accounting estimates 

the companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the companys operating results and financial condition 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts including but not limited to receivable and inventory valuations impairment of tangible and intangible assets longterm employee benefit obligations income taxes environmental matters and litigation managements estimates are based on historical experience facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable the company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the companys accounting policies which could have a material effect on the companys financial position liquidity or results of operations 

pension plans and other post employment benefits 

accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the companys pension and opeb plans management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are remeasured these and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate as permitted by gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plans benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive 

substantially all of the companys benefit obligation for pensions and opeb are attributable to the benefit plans in the us in the us the single equivalent discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixedincome instruments provided by the plans actuaries as of the measurement date the company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for nonus benefit plans historically the company utilized prevailing longterm high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate applicable to each country at the measurement date

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

within the us the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries where appropriate assetliability studies are also taken into consideration the longterm expected return on plan assets in the us is based upon historical real returns net of inflation for the asset classes covered by the investment policy expected performance and projections of inflation and interest rates over the longterm period during which benefits are payable to plan participants consistent with prior years the longterm expected return on plan assets in the us reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the companys active management of the plans assets in connection with pension contributions of 2900 million to its principal us pension plan for the period of january 1 2017 through august 31 2017 an investment policy study was completed for the principal us pension plan the study resulted in new target asset allocations for the us pension plan with resulting changes to the expected return on plan assets the longterm rate of return on assets decreased from 800 percent for the predecessor period to 625 percent for the successor period in 2017 

i n determining annual expense for the principal us pension plan the company uses a marketrelated value of assets rather than its fair value accordingly there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation as a result changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the companys calculation of net periodic pension cost generally the marketrelated value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months however as a result of the merger for the successor periods the marketrelated value of assets was calculated by averaging market returns from september 1 2017 through the respective year ends 

the following table shows the marketrelated value and fair value of plan assets for the principal us pension plan 



for plans other than the principal us pension plan pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets 

the following table highlights the potential impact on the companys pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the companys pension and opeb plans based on assets and liabilities at december 31 2019 



additional information with respect to pension and opeb expenses liabilities and assumptions is discussed under longterm employee benefits beginning on page 72 and in note 20  pension plans and other post employment benefits to the consolidated financial statements

environmental matters 

accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated at december 31 2019  the company had accrued obligations of 336 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs including 51 million for the remediation of superfund sites as remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs the companys estimates are based on a number of factors including the complexity of the geology the nature and extent of contamination the type of remedy the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties prps at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other prps therefore considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs and under adverse changes in circumstances it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to 620 million above that amount consequently it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows it is the opinion of the company’s management however that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition or cash flows for further discussion see environmental matters in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 3  recent accounting guidance and note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements 

legal contingencies 

the companys results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company including product liability claims patent infringement and antitrust claims and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts the company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations settlements rulings advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters management considers many factors these factors include but are not limited to the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims the companys experience with similar types of claims the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed input from outside legal counsel the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matters current status considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding in such situations the company will not recognize a loss if based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in note 18  commitments and contingent liabilities to the consolidated financial statements 

indemnification assets 

the company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities by dupont dow and chemours the term of this indemnification is generally indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses as well as monetary and nonmonetary settlements and judgments in connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable in assessing the probability of recovery the company considers the contractual rights under the separation agreements and any potential credit risk future events such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of dupont dow and  or chemours could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded the company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable see note 5  divestitures and other transactions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to indemnifications

the breadth of the companys operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in the normal course of business the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the companys tax assets and tax liabilities it is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant however due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made

deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the companys assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies for example changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period in some situations these changes could be material see note 10  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

at december 31 2019  the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of 633 million  inclusive of a valuation allowance of 457 million  realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time as a result changes in tax laws assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets see note 10  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance 

valuation of assets and impairment considerations 

the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in the companys valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates royalty rates and discount rates although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill other intangible assets property plant and equipment investments in nonconsolidated affiliates and other assets is an integral part of the companys normal ongoing review of operations testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects managements best estimates at a particular point in time the dynamic economic environment in which the companys segments operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices market growth and inflation rates can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized in addition the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the companys growth strategy strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets such an assessment could result in impairment losses 

the company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment one level below the operating segment or component is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities as a result of the internal reorganizations and realignments the company changed its reportable segments to seed and crop protection to reflect the manner in which the companys chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources the change in reportable segments resulted in changes to the companys reporting units for goodwill impairment testing to align with the level at which discrete financial information is available for review by management the company’s reporting units include seed crop protection and digital in connection with the change in reportable segments and reporting units goodwill was reassigned from the former agriculture reporting unit to the seed crop protection and digital reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach 

part ii 

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed at the company level include but are not limited to gdp growth rates longterm commodity prices equity and credit market activity discount rates foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include but are not limited to changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and new product launches cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting unit if the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value additional quantitative testing is required 

if additional quantitative testing is required the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge if any is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value the company determined fair values for each of the reporting units using the income approach or market approach 

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate the company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and includes an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on its most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts the company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing the company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts discount rates used in the company’s reporting unit valuations ranged from 95 to 105 under the market approach the company uses metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions for comparable companies 

estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods the company’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the merger and as a result any declines in projected cash flows or increases in discount rates could have a material negative impact on the fair value of the companys reporting units and assets and therefore result in an impairment 

as discussed above in connection with the change in reportable segments and reporting units the company performed a goodwill impairment analysis for the former agriculture reporting unit immediately prior to the realignment and the newly created reporting units immediately after the realignment the impairment analysis was performed using a discounted cash flow model a form of the income approach utilizing level 3 unobservable inputs or a market approach the company’s significant estimates in this analysis include but are not limited to future cash flow projections the weighted average cost of capital the terminal growth rate and the tax rate the company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates recent operating results and planned business strategy the company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate based on the goodwill impairment analysis performed both immediately prior to and immediately subsequent to the realignment the company concluded the fair value of the former agriculture reporting unit and the newly created reporting units exceeded their carrying value and no goodwill impairment charge was necessary 

in the third quarter of 2019 and in connection with strategic product and portfolio reviews the company determined that the fair value of certain intangible assets classified as developed technology other intangible assets and iprd within the seed segment that primarily relate to heritage das intangibles previously acquired from cooperativa central de pesquisa agrícolas coodetec was less than the carrying value due to the company’s focus on advancing more competitive products and eliminating redundancy and complexity across the breeding programs as a result the company recorded a pretax noncash intangible asset impairment charge of 54 million 41 million aftertax the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of these intangibles involve management judgment and estimates relating to future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual cash flows refer to note 7  restructuring and asset related charges  net note 15  goodwill and other intangible assets and note 23  fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for more information

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 quantitative testing was performed on all of the company’s reporting units based on the results of the quantitative testing the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values for the seed reporting unit the excess fair value over carrying value is approximately 12 and therefore carries a higher risk of impairment charges in future periods the dynamic economic environments in which the companys diversified product lines operate and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices product mix market growth and inflation rates can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results changes in factors circumstances and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company also performed an impairment test on indefinitelived intangibles and determined that the fair value of certain iprd assets had declined as a result of the company’s decision to accelerate the ramp up of the enlist e3 tm trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands over the next five years with minimal use of the roundup ready 2 yield® and roundup ready 2 xtend ® traits thereafter for the remaining term of the nonexclusive license with the monsanto company this resulted in the company concluding that the recoverability of certain iprd projects associated with roundup ready 2 xtend ® were impaired resulting in a pretax noncash impairment charge of 90 million  69 million aftertax refer to note 7  restructuring and asset related charges  net note 15  goodwill and other intangible assets and note 23  fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the company’s goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for the seed reporting unit at december 31 2019 is shown below in millions 



prepaid royalties 

the company’s seed segment currently has certain thirdparty biotechnology trait license agreements which require upfront and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions these payments are reflected as other current assets and other assets and are amortized to cost of goods sold as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the term of the license the rate of royalty amortization expense recognized is based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio market dynamics farmer preferences growth rates and projected planted acres changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology could impact the rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty 

at december 31 2019 the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in other current assets and other assets was 440 million and 794 million  respectively the majority of the balance of prepaid royalties relates to the company’s wholly owned subsidiary pioneer hibred international inc’s “pioneer” nonexclusive license in the united states and canada for the monsanto companys genuity ® roundup ready 2 yield ® glyphosate tolerance trait and roundup ready 2 xtend ® glyphosate and dicamba tolerance trait for soybeans “roundup ready 2 license agreement” the prepaid royalty asset relates to a series of upfront fixed and variable royalty payments to utilize the traits in pioneer’s soybean product mix the company’s historical expectation has been that the technology licensed under the roundup ready 2 license agreement would be used as the primary herbicide tolerance trait platform in the pioneer ® brand soybean through the term of the agreement das and ms technologies llc jointly developed and own the enlist e3 tm herbicide tolerance trait for soybeans which provides tolerance to 2 4d choline in enlist duo ® and enlist one ® herbicides as well as glyphosate and glufosinate herbicides in connection with the validation of breeding plans and largescale product development timelines during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company is accelerating the ramp up of the enlist e3 tm trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands including pioneer ® brands over the next five years during the rampup period the company is expected to significantly reduce the volume of products with the roundup ready 2 yield ® and roundup ready 2 xtend ® herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021 with expected minimal use of the trait platform thereafter for the remainder of the roundup ready 2 license agreement the “transition plan” the rate of royalty expense is therefore expected to significantly increase through higher amortization of the prepaid royalty as fewer seeds containing the respective trait are expected to be utilized

in connection with the departure from these traits in the companys product portfolio beginning january 1 2020 the company will present and disclose the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a component of restructuring and asset related charges  net in the consolidated statement of operations the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense will represent the difference between the rate of amortization based on the revised number of units expected to contain the roundup ready 2 yield ® and roundup ready 2 xtend ® trait technology and the per unit cash rate per the roundup ready 2 license agreement the noncash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense estimated for 2020 is approximately 160 million aggregating to approximately 500 million over the next five years 

further changes in factors and assumptions associated with usage of the trait platform licensed under the roundup ready 2 license agreement including the transition plan could further impact the rate of recognition of the prepaid royalty and statement of operations presentation of the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense

the company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy the contractual obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business 

longterm employee benefits 

the company has various obligations to its employees and retirees the company maintains retirementrelated programs in many countries that have a longterm impact on the companys earnings and cash flows these plans are typically defined benefit pension plans as well as medical dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees other post employment benefits or opeb plans substantially all of the companys worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the companys worldwide opeb obligations are attributable to the us benefit plans 

pension coverage for employees of the companys nonus consolidated subsidiaries is provided to the extent deemed appropriate through separate plans the company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics life expectancy and countryspecific pension funding rules change where permitted by applicable law the company reserves the right to change modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension medical dental life insurance and disability benefits 

benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees pay near retirement in november 2016 the company announced changes to the us pension and opeb plans the company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the us pension plans on november 30 2018 therefore as of november 30 2018 active employees participating in the us pension plans will not accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation received in addition to the changes to the us pension plans opeb eligible employees who will be under the age of 50 as of november 30 2018 will not receive postretirement medical dental and life insurance benefits the majority of employees hired in the us on or after january 1 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and postretirement medical dental and life insurance plans but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans 

pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits the company did not make contributions to the principal us pension plan for the year ended december 31 2019  

funding for each pension plan other than the principal us pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates thus there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense in general however improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs the company contributed 39 million 103 million 34 million and 67 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal us pension plan for the year ended december 31 2019  the year ended december 31 2018  the period september 1 through december 31 2017  and the period january 1 through august 31 2017  respectively 

us pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows the companys remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows the company made benefit payments of 82 million 111 million 35 million and 57 million to its unfunded plans for the year ended december 31 2019  the year ended december 31 2018  the period september 1 through december 31 2017  and the period january 1 through august 31 2017  respectively 

the companys opeb plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows pretax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were 202 million 216 million 59 million and 166 million for the year ended december 31 2019  the year ended december 31 2018  the period september 1 through december 31 2017  and the period january 1 through august 31 2017  respectively changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs demographic changes plan amendments and changes in participant premiums copays and deductibles 

in 2020 the company expects to contribute approximately 60 million to its pension plans other than the principal us pension plan and about 240 million for its opeb plans the company is evaluating potential discretionary contributions in 2020 to the principal us pension plan that could reduce a portion of the underfunded benefit obligation any discretionary contributions depend on various factors including market conditions and tax deductible limits

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the companys income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as opeb costs the following table summarizes the extent to which the companys loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2019  the year ended december 31 2018  the period september 1 through december 31 2017  and the period january 1 through august 31 2017 was affected by pretax charges related to longterm employee benefits 



the above credit charges for pension and opeb are determined as of the beginning of each period longterm employee credits were 48 million for the year ended december 31 2019 and 69 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the change is due to decrease in expected return on plan assets 

activities for the period ended december 31 2018 and for the period september 1 through december 31 2017 benefited from the absence of the amortization of net losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss see pension plans and other post employment benefits under the critical accounting estimates section beginning on page 65 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense 

for 2020 longterm employee benefits credit from continuing operations is expected to increase by about 180 million the increase is mainly due to lower interest cost
