 item 1 business 

exxon mobil corporation was incorporated in the state of new jersey in 1882 divisions and affiliated companies of exxonmobil operate or market products in the united states and most other countries of the world our principal business involves exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas manufacture trade transport and sale of crude oil natural gas petroleum products petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products and pursuit of loweremission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage hydrogen and biofuels affiliates of exxonmobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses 

exxon mobil corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates many with names that include exxonmobil  exxon  esso mobil or xto  for convenience and simplicity in this report the terms exxonmobil exxon esso mobil and xto  as well as terms like corporation  company  our  we and its  are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates the precise meaning depends on the context in question 

the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive both within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industrial and individual consumers certain industry participants including exxonmobil are expanding investments in loweremission energy and emissionreduction services and technologies the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes 

operating data and industry segment information for the corporation are contained in the financial section of this report under the following “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business results” and “note 18 disclosures about segments and related information” information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report 

exxonmobil has a longstanding commitment to the development of proprietary technology we have a wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments exxonmobil held over 8 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of 2021 for technology licensed to third parties revenues totaled approximately 66 million in 2021 although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our company the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent trade secret trademark license franchise or concession 

exxonmobil operates in a highly complex competitive and changing global energy business environment where decisions and risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length this longterm orientation underpins the corporations philosophy on talent development 

talent development begins with recruiting exceptional candidates and continues with individually planned experiences and training designed to facilitate broad development and a deep understanding of our business across the business cycle our careeroriented approach to talent development results in strong retention and an average length of service of 30 years for our career employees compensation benefits and workplace programs support the corporations talent management approach and are designed to attract and retain employees for a career through compensation that is market competitive longterm oriented and highly differentiated by individual performance 

over 60 percent of our global employee workforce is from outside the us and over the past decade 39 percent of our global hires for management professional and technical positions were female and 35 percent of our us hires for management professional and technical positions were minorities with over 160 nationalities represented in the company we encourage and respect diversity of thought ideas and perspective from our workforce we consider and monitor diversity through all stages of employment including recruitment training and development of our employees we also work closely with the communities where we operate to identify and invest in initiatives that help support local needs including local talent and skill development 

the number of regular employees was 63 thousand 72 thousand and 75 thousand at years ended 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively regular employees are defined as active executive management professional technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the corporation and are covered by the corporation’s benefit plans and programs 

as discussed in item 1a risk factors in this report compliance with existing and potential future government regulations including taxes environmental regulations and other government regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the production and sale of our products may have material effects on the capital expenditures earnings and competitive position of exxonmobil with respect to the environment throughout exxonmobil’s businesses new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air water and ground including but not limited to compliance with environmental regulations these include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions and expenditures for asset retirement obligations using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute exxonmobil’s 2021 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps including exxonmobil’s share of equity company expenditures were 46 billion of which 34 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures the total cost for such activities is expected to increase to approximately 53 billion in 2022 with capital expenditures expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total costs for 2023 are anticipated to be higher as the low carbon solutions business matures and the corporation progresses its emissionreduction plans

 item 1a risk factors 

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses and the pursuit of loweremission business opportunities many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

supply and demand 

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity or product any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the upstream segment financial condition and proved reserves on the other hand a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the downstream and chemical segments 

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broadbased economic activities and levels of prosperity the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government regulation or austerity programs trade tariffs or broader breakdowns in global trade security or public health issues and responses or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

covid19 the initial phase of the covid19 pandemic caused conditions of demand reduction and oversupply to develop rapidly and resulted in significant decreases in commodity prices and margins exxonmobil’s future business results including cash flows and financing needs will be affected by the scope and severity of current and future covid outbreaks actions taken by governments and others to address the pandemic and the effects of those actions on national and global economies and markets changes in consumer behavior that affect demand for our products and the effectiveness of the corporation’s own responsive actions to protect the safety and wellbeing of our people 

other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns increased competitiveness of or government policy support for alternative energy sources changes in technology that alter fuel choices such as technological advances in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation changes in consumer preferences for our products including consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric transportation or alternatives to plastic products and broadbased changes in personal income levels see also “climate change and the energy transition” below 

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as the level of and adherence by participating countries to production quotas established by opec or opec and other agreements among sovereigns government policies including actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that restrict oil and gas production or increase associated costs and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates inflation currency exchange rates and other local or regional market conditions market factors may also result in losses from commodity derivatives and other instruments we use to hedge price exposures or for trading purposes 

government and political factors 

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources including by restricting leasing or permitting activities or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase to the extent governments view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policies restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

restrictions on doing business exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the united states or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions 

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted or may be unable to maintain clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law including changes that result from international treaties and accords and changes in policy that could adversely affect our results such as 

• increases in taxes duties or government royalty rates including retroactive claims 

• price controls 

• changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities including changes in laws affecting offshore drilling operations water use methane emissions hydraulic fracturing or use of new or recycled plastics 

• actions by policymakers regulators or other actors to delay or deny necessary licenses and permits restrict the availability of oil and gas leases or the transportation of our products or otherwise require changes in the companys business or strategy that could result in reduced returns 

• adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components 

• adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the nondisclosure laws of other countries and 

• government actions to cancel contracts redenominate the official currency renounce or default on obligations renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assets 

legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur by government enforcement proceedings alleging noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations or by state and local government actors as well as private plaintiffs acting in parallel that attempt to use the legal system to promote public policy agendas including seeking to reduce the production and sale of hydrocarbon products though litigation targeting the company or other industry participants gain political notoriety or obtain monetary awards from the company 

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism cybersecurity attacks the application of national security laws or policies that result in restricting our ability to do business in a particular jurisdiction and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

climate change and the energy transition 

netzero scenarios driven by concern over the risks of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including emissions from the production and use of oil and gas and their products these actions are being taken both independently by national and regional governments and within the framework of united nations conference of the parties summits under which many countries of the world have endorsed objectives to reduce the atmospheric concentration of co2 over the coming decades with an ambition ultimately to achieve “netzero” netzero means that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities would be balanced by actions that remove such gases from the atmosphere expectations for transition of the world’s energy system to lower emission sources and ultimately netzero derive from hypothetical scenarios that reflect many assumptions about the future and reflect substantial uncertainties the company’s objective to lead in the energy transition including the company’s announced ambition ultimately to achieve netzero with respect to emissions from operations where exxonmobil is the operator carries risks that the transition including underlying technologies policies and markets as discussed in more detail below will not develop at the pace or in the manner expected by current netzero scenarios the success of our strategy for the energy transition will also depend on our ability to recognize key signposts of change in the global energy system on a timely basis and our corresponding ability to direct investment to the technologies and businesses at the appropriate stage of development to best capitalize on our competitive strengths 

greenhouse gas restrictions government actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes trade tariffs minimum renewable usage requirements restrictive permitting increased mileage and other efficiency standards mandates for sales of electric vehicles mandates for use of specific fuels or technologies and other incentives or mandates designed to support transitioning to loweremission energy sources political and other actors and their agents also increasingly seek to advance climate change objectives indirectly such as by seeking to reduce the availability or increase the cost of financing and investment in the oil and gas sector and taking actions intended to promote changes in business strategy for oil and gas companies depending on how policies are formulated and applied such policies could negatively affect our investment returns make our hydrocarbonbased products more expensive or less competitive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon alternatives current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

technology and low carbon solutions achieving societal ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately achieve netzero will require new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources as well as technologies such as carbon capture and storage ccs ccs technologies focused initially on capturing and sequestering co2 emissions from highintensity industrial activities can assist in meeting society’s objective to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas levels while also helping ensure the availability of the reliable and affordable energy the world requires exxonmobil has established a low carbon solutions lcs business unit to advance the development and deployment of these technologies and projects including ccs hydrogen and advanced biofuels breakthrough energy efficiency processes advanced energysaving materials and other technologies the company’s efforts include both inhouse research and development and collaborative efforts with leading universities as well as commercial partners involved in advanced loweremission energy technologies our future results and ability to grow our lcs business and succeed through the energy transition will depend in part on the success of these research and collaboration efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a costcompetitive manner 

policy and market development the scale of the world’s energy system means that in addition to developments in technology as discussed above a successful energy transition will require appropriate support from governments and private participants throughout the global economy our ability to develop and deploy ccs and other lower emission energy technologies at commercial scale and the growth and future returns of lcs and other emerging businesses in which we invest will depend in part on the continued development of supportive government policies and markets failure or delay of these policies or markets to materialize or be maintained could adversely impact these investments policy and other actions that result in restricting the availability of hydrocarbon products without commensurate reduction in demand may have unpredictable adverse effects including increased commodity price volatility periods of significantly higher commodity prices and resulting inflationary pressures and local or regional energy shortages such effects in turn may depress economic growth or lead to rapid or conflicting shifts in policy by different actors with resulting adverse effects on our businesses 

see also the discussion of “supply and demand” “government and political factors” and “operational and other factors” in this item 1a 

operational and other factors 

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget 

project and portfolio management the longterm success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses as well as the future success of lcs and other emerging loweremission investments depends on complex longterm capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role in addition to the effective management of individual projects exxonmobil’s success including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio including diversification among types and locations of our projects products produced and strategies to divest assets we may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we contemplate in our strategies additionally we may retain certain liabilities following a divestment and could be held liable for past use or for different liabilities than anticipated 

the term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports 

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commoditybased nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employees 

research and development and technological change to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s technology research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions to remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large amounts of data to our businesses 

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we employ a comprehensive enterprise risk management system to identify and manage risk across our businesses we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if we do not timely identify and mitigate applicable risks or if our management systems and controls do not function as intended 

cybersecurity exxonmobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of sources including statesponsored actors exxonmobil’s defensive preparedness includes multilayered technological capabilities for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruptions nontechnological measures such as threat information sharing with governmental and industry groups internal training and awareness campaigns including routine testing of employee awareness and an emphasis on resiliency including business response and recovery if the measures we are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient or if our proprietary data is otherwise not protected exxonmobil as well as our customers employees or third parties could be adversely affected we are also exposed to potential harm from cybersecurity events that may affect the operations of thirdparties including our partners suppliers service providers including providers of cloudhosting services for our data or applications and customers cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment damage or destroy assets compromise business systems result in proprietary information being altered lost or stolen result in employee customer or thirdparty information being compromised or otherwise disrupt our business operations we could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting regulatory actions litigation or reputational harm 

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our facilities are designed constructed and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties including those associated with wave wind and current intensity marine ice flow patterns permafrost stability storm surge magnitude temperature extremes extreme rainfall events and earthquakes our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning 

insurance limitations the ability of the corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this item 1a is limited by the availability and cost of coverage which may not be economic as well as the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

competition as noted in item 1 above the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive we face competition not only from other private firms but also from stateowned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries and as partners with other private firms in some cases these stateowned companies may pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders such as exxonmobil technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of exxonmobil or reduce the need for resourceowning countries to partner with privatesector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national resources as described in more detail above our hydrocarbonbased energy products are also subject to growing and in many cases governmentsupported competition from alternative energy sources 

reputation our reputation is an important corporate asset factors that could have a negative impact on our reputation include an operating incident or significant cybersecurity disruption changes in consumer views concerning our products a perception by investors or others that the corporation is making insufficient progress with respect to our ambition to lead in the energy transition or that pursuit of this ambition may result in allocation of capital to investments with reduced returns and other adverse events such as those described in this item 1a negative impacts on our reputation could in turn make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities obtain necessary regulatory approvals obtain financing attract talent or could reduce consumer demand for our branded products exxonmobil’s reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole 

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

1 disclosure of reserves 

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2021 

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies natural gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period as a result of higher average prices in 2021 certain quantities of crude oil bitumen and natural gas that did not qualify as proved reserves in the prior year qualified as proved reserves at yearend 2021 otherwise no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2021 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 



1 other americas includes proved developed reserves of 106 million barrels of crude oil and 151 billion cubic feet of natural gas as well as proved undeveloped reserves of 488 million barrels of crude oil and 233 billion cubic feet of natural gas 

in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance performance of enhanced oil recovery projects regulatory changes the impact of fiscal and commercial terms asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment and other factors described in item 1a risk factors 

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals government policies consumer preferences and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels in addition proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects 

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2021 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing wellestablished technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 3‑d and 4‑d seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tools used to interpret the data included seismic processing software reservoir modeling and simulation software and data analysis packages 

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves and resources group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude oil natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the manager of the global reserves and resources group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment has a degree in engineering and served on the oil and gas reserves committee of the society of petroleum engineers spe the group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under sec guidelines this group includes individuals who hold degrees in either engineering or geology 

the global reserves and resources group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations commercial and market assessments analysis of well and field performance and longstanding approval guidelines no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserves and resources group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement 

2 proved undeveloped reserves 

at yearend 2021 approximately 63 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 34 percent of the 185 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to 50 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2020 during the year exxonmobil conducted development activities that resulted in the transfer of approximately 05 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end the largest transfers were related to development activities in the united states during 2021 extensions and discoveries primarily in the united states brazil and guyana resulted in an addition of approximately 13 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves along with an increase of approximately 06 goeb due to revisions primarily in asia and canada 

overall investments of 80 billion were made by the corporation during 2021 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 78 billion for oil and gas producing activities along with additional investments for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities these investments represented 65 percent of the 123 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures 

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long leadtime in order to be developed development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects proved undeveloped reserves in australia canada kazakhstan the united states and the united arab emirates have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals government policies consumer preferences the pace of coventurergovernment funding changes in the amount and timing of capital investments and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries in australia proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the gorgon jansz lng project in canada proved undeveloped reserves are related to cold lake operations in kazakhstan the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the tengizchevroil joint venture development that includes a production license in the tengiz  korolev field complex the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress in the united arab emirates proved undeveloped reserves are associated with an approved development plan and continued drilling investment for the producing upper zakum field

 item 1a risk factors 

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

  

supply and demand 

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the upstream segment financial condition and proved reserves on the other hand a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the downstream and chemical segments 

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broadbased economic activities and levels of prosperity the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs trade tariffs security or public health issues and responses or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil demand reduction due to the covid19 pandemic as well as accompanying conditions of oversupply have led to a significant decrease in commodity prices and margins future business results including cash flows and financing needs will be affected by the extent and duration of these conditions and the effectiveness of responsive actions that the corporation and others take including actions to reduce capital and operating expenses and actions taken by governments and others to address the covid19 pandemic including the ongoing development and distribution of covid19 vaccines and the impact of the pandemic on national and global economies and markets 

other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns increased competitiveness of or government policy support for alternative energy sources changes in technology that alter fuel choices such as technological advances in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation changes in consumer preferences for our products including consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric transportation or alternatives to plastic products and broadbased changes in personal income levels 

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by countries to opec production quotas and other agreements among sovereigns government policies that restrict oil and gas production or increase associated costs and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates inflation currency exchange rates and other local or regional market conditions 

government and political factors 

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources including by restricting leasing or permitting activities or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase to the extent governments view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policies restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

restrictions on doing business exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the united states or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions 

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted or may be unable to maintain clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as 

• increases in taxes duties or government royalty rates including retroactive claims 

• price controls 

• changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities including changes in laws affecting offshore drilling operations water use methane emissions hydraulic fracturing or use of plastics 

• actions by regulators or other political actors to delay or deny necessary licenses and permits or restrict the transportation of our products 

• adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components 

• adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the nondisclosure laws of other countries and 

• government actions to cancel contracts redenominate the official currency renounce or default on obligations renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assets 

legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur by government enforcement proceedings alleging noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations or by state and local government actors as well as private plaintiffs acting in parallel that attempt to use the legal system to promote public policy agendas gain political notoriety or obtain monetary awards from the company 

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism cybersecurity attacks and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions driven by concern over the risks of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or production and use of oil and gas these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes trade tariffs minimum renewable usage requirements restrictive permitting increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy political and other actors and their agents also increasingly seek to advance climate change objectives indirectly such as by seeking to reduce the availability of or increase the cost for financing and investment in the oil and gas sector and taking actions intended to promote changes in business strategy for oil and gas companies depending on how policies are formulated and applied they could have the potential to negatively affect investment returns make our products more expensive or less competitive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support transitioning to alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies governments and others are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research both inhouse and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world including the massachusetts institute of technology princeton university the university of texas and stanford university in the us and in singapore with nanyang technological institute and the national university our research projects focus on developing advanced biofuels and hydrogen carbon capture and storage breakthrough energy efficiency processes advanced energysaving materials and other technologies in collaboration with our partners including synthetic genomics fuelcell energy and global thermostat our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a costcompetitive manner see “operational and other factors” below 

  

operational and other factors 

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget 

project and portfolio management the longterm success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex longterm capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role in addition to the effective management of individual projects exxonmobil’s success including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio including diversification among types and locations of our projects and strategies to divest assets we may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we contemplate in our strategies additionally we may retain certain liabilities following a divestment and could be held liable for past use or for different liabilities than anticipated 

the term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports 

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commoditybased nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employees 

research and development and technological change to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions to remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large amounts of data to our businesses 

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended 

cybersecurity exxonmobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of threat actors including statesponsored actors exxonmobil’s defensive preparedness includes multilayered technological capabilities for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruptions nontechnological measures such as threat information sharing with governmental and industry groups internal training and awareness campaigns including routine testing of employee awareness and an emphasis on resiliency including business response and recovery if the measures we are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient or if our proprietary data is otherwise not protected exxonmobil as well as our customers employees or third parties could be adversely affected cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment damage or destroy assets compromise business systems result in proprietary information being altered lost or stolen result in employee customer or thirdparty information being compromised or otherwise disrupt our business operations we could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting regulatory actions litigation or reputational harm 

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our facilities are designed constructed and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties including those associated with wave wind and current intensity marine ice flow patterns permafrost stability storm surge magnitude temperature extremes extreme rainfall events and earthquakes our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning 

insurance limitations the ability of the corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this item 1a is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

competition as noted in item 1 above the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive we face competition not only from other private firms but also from stateowned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries and as partners with other private firms in some cases these stateowned companies may pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders such as exxonmobil technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of exxonmobil or reduce the need for resourceowning countries to partner with privatesector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national resources 

reputation our reputation is an important corporate asset an operating incident significant cybersecurity disruption change in consumer views concerning our products or other adverse event such as those described in this item 1a may have a negative impact on our reputation which in turn could make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities obtain necessary regulatory approvals obtain financing or could reduce consumer demand for our branded products exxonmobil’s reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole 

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows 

1 disclosure of reserves 

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2020 

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies natural gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period primarily as a result of very low prices during 2020 and the effects of reductions in capital expenditures under the sec definition of proved reserves certain quantities of crude oil bitumen and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at yearend 2020 otherwise no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2020 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 



1 other americas includes proved developed reserves of 119 million barrels of crude oil and 138 billion cubic feet of natural gas as well as proved undeveloped reserves of 179 million barrels of crude oil and 77 billion cubic feet of natural gas 

in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance performance of enhanced oil recovery projects regulatory changes the impact of fiscal and commercial terms asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment and other factors described in item 1a risk factors 

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals government policies consumer preferences and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels in addition proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects 

during the first and second quarters of 2020 the balance of supply and demand for petroleum and petrochemical products experienced two significant disruptive effects on the demand side the covid19 pandemic spread rapidly through most areas of the world resulting in substantial reductions in consumer and business activity and significantly reduced demand for crude oil natural gas and petroleum products this reduction in demand coincided with announcements of increased production in certain key oilproducing countries which led to increases in inventory levels and sharp declines in prices for crude oil natural gas and petroleum products market conditions continued to reflect considerable uncertainty throughout 2020 

as noted above certain quantities of crude oil bitumen and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at yearend 2020 amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include 31 billion barrels of bitumen at kearl 06 billion barrels of bitumen at cold lake and 05 billion oilequivalent barrels in the united states the corporations nearterm reduction in capital expenditures resulted in a net reduction to estimates of proved reserves of approximately 15 billion oilequivalent barrels mainly related to unconventional drilling in the united states among the factors that could result in portions of these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the sec price basis cost reductions operating efficiencies and increases in planned capital spending 

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2020 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2020 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing wellestablished technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 3d and 4d seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves and resources group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude oil natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the manager of the global reserves and resources group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment has a degree in engineering and currently serves on the oil and gas reserves committee of the society of petroleum engineers spe the group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under sec guidelines this group includes individuals who hold degrees in either engineering or geology 

the global reserves and resources group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations commercial and market assessments analysis of well and field performance and longstanding approval guidelines no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserves and resources group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement 

2 proved undeveloped reserves 

at yearend 2020 approximately 50 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 33 percent of the 152 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to the 77 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2019 during the year exxonmobil conducted development activities that resulted in the transfer of approximately 09 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end the largest transfers were related to development activities in the united states qatar the united arab emirates and guyana during 2020 extensions primarily in the united states and canada resulted in an addition of approximately 05 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves also as a result of very low prices during 2020 and the effects of reductions in capital expenditures the corporation reclassified approximately 23 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves which no longer met the sec definition of proved reserves primarily in the united states and canada 

overall investments of 107 billion were made by the corporation during 2020 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 104 billion for oil and gas producing activities along with additional investments for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities these investments represented 74 percent of the 144 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures 

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long leadtime in order to be developed development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects proved undeveloped reserves in australia kazakhstan the united states and the united arab emirates have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals government policies consumer preferences the pace of coventurergovernment funding changes in the amount and timing of capital investments and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries in australia proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the gorgon jansz lng project in kazakhstan the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the tengizchevroil joint venture development that includes a production license in the tengiz  korolev field complex the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress in the united arab emirates proved undeveloped reserves are associated with an approved development plan and continued drilling investment for the producing upper zakum field 

3 oil and gas production production prices and production costs 

a oil and gas production 

the table below summarizes production by final product sold and by geographic area for the last three years 



1 other americas includes crude oil production for 2020 2019 and 2018 of 29 thousand 2 thousand and 2 thousand barrels daily respectively and natural gas production available for sale for 2020 2019 and 2018 of 45 million 36 million and 28 million cubic feet daily respectively 

b production prices and production costs 

the table below summarizes average production prices and average production costs by geographic area and by product type for the last three years 





average production prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the corporation’s own production as the divisor average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids ngl production used for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section 3a the volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in section 3a the natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those shown in the reserves table in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared natural gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels 

4 drilling and other exploratory and development activities 

a number of net productive and dry wells drilled 





b exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources extracted by mining technologies 

syncrude operations syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen and then upgrade it to produce a highquality light 32 degrees api sweet synthetic crude oil imperial oil limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint venture exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited in 2020 the company’s share of net production of synthetic crude oil was about 68 thousand barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 55 thousand acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit 

kearl operations kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen imperial oil limited holds a 7096 percent interest in the joint venture and exxonmobil canada properties holds the other 2904 percent exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited and a 100 percent interest in exxonmobil canada properties kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit 

kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of fort mcmurray alberta canada bitumen is extracted from oil sands and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains the product a blend of bitumen and diluent is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail during 2020 average net production at kearl was about 219 thousand barrels per day 

primarily as a result of very low prices during 2020 under the sec definition of proved reserves the entire 31 billion barrels of bitumen at kearl did not qualify as proved reserves at yearend 2020 among the factors that could result in portions of these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the sec price basis cost reductions andor operating efficiencies

 item 1a risk factors 

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

  

supply and demand 

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the upstream segment financial condition and proved reserves on the other hand a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the downstream and chemical segments 

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broadbased economic activities and levels of prosperity the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs trade tariffs security or public health concerns or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources changes in technology that alter fuel choices such as technological advances in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation changes in consumer preferences for our products including consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric transportation and broadbased changes in personal income levels 

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by countries to opec production quotas and other agreements among sovereigns and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates inflation currency exchange rates and other local or regional market conditions

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

restrictions on doing business exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the united states or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions 

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted or may be unable to maintain clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

  

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as 

 increases in taxes duties or government royalty rates including retroactive claims 

 price controls 

 changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities including changes in laws related to offshore drilling operations water use methane emissions hydraulic fracturing or use of plastics 

 adoption of regulations mandating efficiency standards the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components 

 adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the nondisclosure laws of other countries and 

 government actions to cancel contracts redenominate the official currency renounce or default on obligations renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assets 

legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur by government enforcement proceedings alleging noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations or by state and local government actors as well as private plaintiffs acting in parallel that attempt to use the legal system to promote public policy agendas gain political notoriety or obtain monetary awards from the company 

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism cybersecurity attacks and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions due to concern over the risks of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes minimum renewable usage requirements restrictive permitting increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy such policies could make our products more expensive less competitive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support transitioning to alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies governments and others are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research both inhouse and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world including the massachusetts institute of technology princeton university the university of texas and stanford university our research projects focus on developing algaebased biofuels carbon capture and storage breakthrough energy efficiency processes advanced energysaving materials and other technologies for example exxonmobil is launching an innovative relationship with the us department of energy’s national laboratory network to bring lowemission energy breakthroughs to commercial scale our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a costcompetitive manner see “operational and other factors” below 

  

operational and other factors 

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget 

  

project and portfolio management the longterm success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex longterm capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role in addition to the effective management of individual projects exxonmobil’s success including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio including diversification among types and locations of our projects and strategies to divest assets we may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we contemplate in our strategies additionally we may retain certain liabilities following a divestment and could be held liable for past use or for different liabilities than anticipated 

the term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports 

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commoditybased nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employees 

research and development and technological change to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions to remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large amounts of data to our businesses 

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended 

cybersecurity exxonmobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of threat actors including statesponsored actors exxonmobil’s defensive preparedness includes multilayered technological capabilities for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruptions nontechnological measures such as threat information sharing with governmental and industry groups internal training and awareness campaigns including routine testing of employee awareness and an emphasis on resiliency including business response and recovery if the measures we are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient exxonmobil as well as our customers employees or third parties could be adversely affected cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment damage or destroy assets compromise business systems result in proprietary information being altered lost or stolen result in employee customer or thirdparty information being compromised or otherwise disrupt our business operations we could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting regulatory actions litigation or reputational harm 

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our facilities are designed constructed and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties including those associated with wave wind and current intensity marine ice flow patterns permafrost stability storm surge magnitude temperature extremes extreme rainfall events and earthquakes our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning 

  

insurance limitations the ability of the corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this item 1a is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

competition as noted in item 1 above the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive we face competition not only from other private firms but also from stateowned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries and as partners with other private firms in some cases these stateowned companies may pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders such as exxonmobil technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of exxonmobil or reduce the need for resourceowning countries to partner with privatesector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national resources 

reputation our reputation is an important corporate asset an operating incident significant cybersecurity disruption change in consumer views concerning our products or other adverse event such as those described in this item 1a may have a negative impact on our reputation which in turn could make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities obtain necessary regulatory approvals obtain financing or could reduce consumer demand for our branded products exxonmobil’s reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole 

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

1 disclosure of reserves 

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2019 

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies natural gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2019 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 

  

   

1 other americas includes proved developed reserves of 18 million barrels of crude oil and 75 billion cubic feet of natural gas as well as proved undeveloped reserves of 280 million barrels of crude oil and 292 billion cubic feet of natural gas 

  

in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance performance of enhanced oil recovery projects regulatory changes the impact of fiscal and commercial terms asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment and other factors described in item 1a risk factors 

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals government policies consumer preferences and significant changes in longterm oil and natural gas price levels in addition proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects 

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2019 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2019 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing wellestablished technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 3d and 4d seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves and resources group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude oil natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the manager of the global reserves and resources group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment has a degree in engineering and currently serves on the oil and gas reserves committee of the society of petroleum engineers spe the group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines this group includes individuals who hold degrees in either engineering or geology 

the global reserves and resources group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations commercial and market assessments analysis of well and field performance and longstanding approval guidelines no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserves and resources group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement 

  

2 proved undeveloped reserves 

at yearend 2019 approximately 77 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 34 percent of the 224 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to the 79 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2018 during the year exxonmobil conducted development activities that resulted in the transfer of approximately 09 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end the largest transfers were related to development activities in the united states the united arab emirates and kazakhstan during 2019 extensions and discoveries primarily in the united states and guyana resulted in an addition of 15 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves along with an increase of 06 goeb due to revisions primarily in asia also the corporation reclassified approximately 14 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves which no longer met the sec definition of proved reserves primarily in the united states which was offset by the extensions in the united states referenced above 

overall investments of 183 billion were made by the corporation during 2019 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 177 billion for oil and gas producing activities along with additional investments for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities these investments represented 78 percent of the 235 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures 

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long leadtime in order to be developed development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects proved undeveloped reserves in the united states canada australia and kazakhstan have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals government policies consumer preferences the pace of coventurergovernment funding changes in the amount and timing of capital investments and significant changes in longterm oil and natural gas price levels of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries in canada proved undeveloped reserves are related to drilling activities in the offshore hebron field and onshore cold lake operations in australia proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the gorgon jansz lng project in kazakhstan the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the tengizchevroil joint venture development that includes a production license in the tengiz  korolev field complex the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress

b gross and net developed acreage 

 1 includes developed acreage in other americas of 472 gross and 295 net thousands of acres for 2019 and 375 gross and 244 net thousands of acres for 2018 

separate acreage data for oil and gas are not maintained because in many instances both are produced from the same acreage 

  

c gross and net undeveloped acreage 

 1 includes undeveloped acreage in other americas of 25327 gross and 12065 net thousands of acres for 2019 and 23872 gross and 9595 net thousands of acres for 2018 

exxonmobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions blocks and leases the terms and conditions under which the corporation maintains exploration andor production rights to the acreage are propertyspecific contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration in some instances the corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension in cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage the corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions the scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the corporation 

  

d summary of acreage terms 

united states 

oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease mineral interest owners include the federal and state governments as well as private mineral interest owners leases typically have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years and a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases under certain circumstances a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced in some instances regarding private property a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright 

canada  other americas 

canada 

exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible these licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work in general these license and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases exploration licenses in offshore eastern canada and the beaufort sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals they are valid for a maximum term of nine years offshore production licenses are valid for 25 years with rights of extension for continued production significant discovery licenses in the offshore relating to currently undeveloped discoveries do not have a definite term 

argentina 

the federal hydrocarbon law was amended in 2014 pursuant to the amended law the production term for an onshore unconventional concession is 35 years and 25 years for a conventional concession with unlimited tenyear extensions possible once a field has been developed in 2019 the government granted three offshore exploration licenses with terms of eight years divided into two exploration periods of four years with an optional extension of five years for each license three onshore exploration concessions were initially granted prior to the amendment and are governed under provincial law with expiration terms between 2020 and 2022 

guyana 

the petroleum exploration and production act authorizes the government of guyana to grant petroleum prospecting and production licenses and to enter into petroleum agreements for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons petroleum agreements provide for an exploration period of up to 10 years and a production period of 20 years with a 10 year extension 

europe 

germany 

exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years with an unlimited number of extensions up to three years each extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions subject to production on the license

under the mining law effective january 1 2003 exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license the term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued license conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the mining law 

production rights granted prior to january 1 2003 remain subject to their existing terms and differ slightly for onshore and offshore areas onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license ranging from 35 to 45 years offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license ranging from 15 to 40 years 

  

  

united kingdom 

acreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed for example many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least onehalf of the original area at the end of the initial term subject to extension for a further 40 years at the end of any such 40year term licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a casebycase basis until they become producing areas or licenses terminate in all other areas the majority of traditional licenses currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years and a final production term of 18 years with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term 

terms for exploration acreage in technically challenged areas are governed by frontier production licenses generally covering a larger initial area than traditional licenses with an initial exploration term of six or nine years with a second term extension of six years and a final production term of 18 years with relinquishment of 75 percent of the original area after three years and 50 percent of the remaining acreage after the next three years innovate licenses issued replace traditional and frontier licenses and offer greater flexibility with respect to periods and work program commitments

nigeria 

exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts pscs with the national oil company the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc nnpc typically holds the underlying oil prospecting license opl and any resulting oil mining lease oml the terms of the pscs are generally 30 years including a tenyear exploration period an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods covered by an opl upon commercial discovery an opl may be converted to an oml partial relinquishment is required under the psc at the end of the tenyear exploration period and omls have a 20year production period that may be extended 

some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an opl opls in deepwater offshore areas are valid for 10 years while in all other areas the licenses are for five years demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an opl to an oml

 item 1a risk factors 

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

  

supply and demand 

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the upstream segment financial condition and proved reserves on the other hand a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the downstream and chemical segments 

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broadbased economic activities and levels of prosperity the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as technological advances in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation or increased consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric vehicles and broadbased changes in personal income levels 

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by countries to opec production quotas and other agreements among sovereigns and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates inflation currency exchange rates and other local or regional market conditions 

  

government and political factors 

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

restrictions on doing business exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the united states or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions 

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted or may be unable to maintain clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

2   

  

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law or interpretation of settled law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as 

  



legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur or by government enforcement proceedings alleging noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations 

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism cybersecurity attacks and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions due to concern over the risks of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes minimum renewable usage requirements restrictive permitting increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy such policies could make our products more expensive less competitive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

government sponsorship of alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies governments and others are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research both inhouse and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world including the massachusetts institute of technology princeton university the university of texas and stanford university our research projects focus on developing algaebased biofuels carbon capture and storage breakthrough energy efficiency processes advanced energysaving materials and other technologies for example exxonmobil is working with fuel cell energy inc to explore using carbonate fuel cells to economically capture co 2 emissions from gasfired power plants our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a costcompetitive manner see “operational and other factors” below 

  

operational and other factors 

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget 

3   

  

project and portfolio management the longterm success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex long‑term capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role in addition to the effective management of individual projects exxonmobil’s success including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio including diversification among types and locations of our projects 

the term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports 

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commodity‑based nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employees 

research and development and technological change to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions to remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies 

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended 

cybersecurity exxonmobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of threat actors including statesponsored actors exxonmobil’s defensive preparedness includes multilayered technological capabilities for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruptions nontechnological measures such as threat information sharing with governmental and industry groups internal training and awareness campaigns including routine testing of employee awareness and an emphasis on resiliency including business response and recovery if the measures we are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient exxonmobil as well as our customers employees or third parties could be adversely affected cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment damage or destroy assets compromise business systems result in proprietary information being altered lost or stolen result in employee customer or thirdparty information being compromised or otherwise disrupt our business operations we could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting regulatory actions litigation or reputational harm 

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our facilities are designed constructed and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties including those associated with wave wind and current intensity marine ice flow patterns permafrost stability storm surge magnitude temperature extremes extreme rainfall events and earthquakes our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning

insurance limitations the ability of the corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this item 1a is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

competition as noted in item 1 above the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive we face competition not only from other private firms but also from stateowned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries in some cases these stateowned companies may pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders such as exxonmobil technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of exxonmobil or reduce the need for resourceowning countries to partner with privatesector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national resources 

reputation our reputation is an important corporate asset an operating incident significant cybersecurity disruption or other adverse event such as those described in this item 1a may have a negative impact on our reputation which in turn could make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities obtain necessary regulatory approvals or could reduce consumer demand for our branded products exxonmobil’s reputation may also be harmed by events which negatively affect the image of our industry as a whole 

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

1 disclosure of reserves 

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2018 

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies natural gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2018 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 

  



  

1 other americas includes proved developed reserves of 1 million barrels of crude oil and 99 billion cubic feet of natural gas as well as proved undeveloped reserves of 226 million barrels of crude oil and 423 billion cubic feet of natural gas 

6   

  

in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance performance of enhanced oil recovery projects regulatory changes the impact of fiscal and commercial terms asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment and other factors described in item 1a risk factors 

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals government policies consumer preferences and significant changes in longterm oil and natural gas price levels in addition proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects 

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2018 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2018 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing wellestablished technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 3d and 4d seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude oil natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the manager of the global reserves group has more than 25 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment has a degree in engineering and currently serves on the oil and gas reserves committee of the society of petroleum engineers spe the group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines this group includes individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology 

the global reserves group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement

  2 proved undeveloped reserves 

at yearend 2018 approximately 79 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 32 percent of the 243 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to the 73 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2017 during the year exxonmobil conducted development activities that resulted in the transfer of approximately 08 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end the largest transfers were related to drilling activity in the united states the united arab emirates canada and russia during 2018 extensions and discoveries primarily in the united states resulted in an addition of approximately 17 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves also the corporation reclassified approximately 03 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves which no longer met the sec definition of proved reserves primarily in the netherlands at the groningen gas field and the united states 

overall investments of 132 billion were made by the corporation during 2018 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 131 billion for oil and gas producing activities and additional investments for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities these investments represented 65 percent of the 202 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures 

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead‑time in order to be developed development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects proved undeveloped reserves in the united states canada australia and kazakhstan have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals government policies consumer preferences the pace of co‑venturergovernment funding changes in the amount and timing of capital investments and significant changes in longterm oil and natural gas price levels of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries in canada proved undeveloped reserves are related to drilling activities in the offshore hebron field and onshore cold lake operations in australia proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the gorgon jansz lng project in kazakhstan the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial development of the producing offshore kashagan field which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement and the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the tengiz – korolev field complex the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress

b gross and net developed acreage   

  



1 includes developed acreage in other americas of 375 gross and 244 net thousands of acres for 2018 and 375 gross and 244 net thousands of acres for 2017 

separate acreage data for oil and gas are not maintained because in many instances both are produced from the same acreage 

  

c gross and net undeveloped acreage 



1 includes undeveloped acreage in other americas of 23872 gross and 9595 net thousands of acres for 2018 and 18625 gross and 8053 net thousands of acres for 2017 

exxonmobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions blocks and leases the terms and conditions under which the corporation maintains exploration andor production rights to the acreage are property‑specific contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration in some instances the corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension in cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage the corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions the scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the corporation

d summary of acreage terms 

united states 

oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease mineral interest owners include the federal and state governments as well as private mineral interest owners leases typically have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years and a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases under certain circumstances a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced in some instances regarding private property a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright 

canada  other americas 

canada 

exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible these licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work in general these license and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases exploration licenses in offshore eastern canada and the beaufort sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals they are valid for a maximum term of nine years offshore production licenses are valid for 25 years with rights of extension for continued production significant discovery licenses in the offshore relating to currently undeveloped discoveries do not have a definite term 

argentina 

the federal hydrocarbon law was amended in december 2014 the onshore concession terms granted prior to the amendment are up to six years divided into three potential exploration periods with an optional extension for up to one year depending on the classification of the area pursuant to the amended law the production term for a conventional production concession would be 25 years and 35 years for an unconventional concession with unlimited tenyear extensions possible once a field has been developed 

guyana 

the petroleum exploration and production act authorizes the government of guyana to grant petroleum prospecting and production licenses and to enter into petroleum agreements for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons petroleum agreements provide for an exploration period of up to 10 years with a production period of 20 years with a 10 year extension 

europe 

germany 

exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years with an unlimited number of extensions of up to three years each extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions as long as there is production on the license 

netherlands 

under the mining law effective january 1 2003 exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license the term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued license conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the mining law 

production rights granted prior to january 1 2003 remain subject to their existing terms and differ slightly for onshore and offshore areas onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license ranging from 35 to 45 years offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license ranging from 15 to 40 years 

norway 

licenses issued between 1972 and 1997 were for an initial period of up to six years with extension of the initial period of one year at a time up to ten years after 1985 and an extension period of up to 30 years with relinquishment of at least onehalf of the original area required at the end of the initial period licenses issued after july 1 1997 have an initial period of up to ten years and a normal extension period of up to 30 years or in special cases of up to 50 years and with relinquishment of at least onehalf of the original area required at the end of the initial period 

20   

  

united kingdom 

acreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed for example many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided for an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least onehalf of the original area at the end of the initial term subject to extension for a further 40 years at the end of any such 40year term licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a casebycase basis until they become producing areas or licenses terminate in all other areas the majority of traditional licenses currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years and a final production term of 18 years with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term 

terms for exploration acreage in technically challenged areas are governed by frontier production licenses generally covering a larger initial area than traditional licenses with an initial exploration term of six or nine years with a second term extension of six years and a final production term of 18 years with relinquishment of 75 percent of the original area after three years and 50 percent of the remaining acreage after the next three years innovate licenses issued replace traditional and frontier licenses and offer greater flexibility with respect to periods and work program commitments 

africa 

angola 

exploration and production activities are governed by production sharing agreements with an initial exploration term of four years and an optional second phase of two to three years the production period is 25 years and agreements generally provide for a negotiated extension 

chad 

exploration permits are issued for a period of five years and are renewable for one or two further fiveyear periods the terms and conditions of the permits including relinquishment obligations are specified in a negotiated convention the production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050 

equatorial guinea 

exploration development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts pscs negotiated with the state ministry of mines and hydrocarbons a new psc was ratified in 2018 the initial exploration period is five years for oil and gas with multiyear extensions available at the discretion of the ministry and limited relinquishments in the absence of commercial discoveries the production period for crude oil ranges from 25 to 30 years while the production period for natural gas ranges from 25 to 50 years 

mozambique 

exploration and production activities are generally governed by concession contracts with the government of the republic of mozambique represented by the ministry of mineral resources and energy an interest in area 4 offshore mozambique was acquired in 2017 terms for area 4 are governed by the exploration and production concession contract epcc for area 4 offshore of the rovuma block the epcc expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development for a given discovery area 

in 2018 an interest was acquired in offshore blocks a5b z5c and z5d terms for the three blocks are governed by their respective epccs which have an initial exploration phase that expires in 2022 with the possibility of two additional exploration phases expiring in 2024 and 2025 the epccs provide a development and production period that expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development 

nigeria 

exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts pscs with the national oil company the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc nnpc typically holds the underlying oil prospecting license opl and any resulting oil mining lease oml the terms of the pscs are generally 30 years including a tenyear exploration period an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods covered by an opl upon commercial discovery an opl may be converted to an oml partial relinquishment is required under the psc at the end of the tenyear exploration period and omls have a 20year production period that may be extended 

some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an opl opls in deepwater offshore areas are valid for 10 years while in all other areas the licenses are for five years demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an opl to an oml

 item 1a risk factors exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

  

supply and demand 

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the upstream segment financial condition and proved reserves on the other hand a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the downstream and chemical segments 

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broadbased economic activities and levels of prosperity the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for energy associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as technological advances in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation or increased consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric vehicles and broadbased changes in personal income levels 

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to opec production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates inflation currency exchange rates and other local or regional market conditions 

  

government and political factors 

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

restrictions on doing business exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the united states or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions 

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted or may be unable to maintain clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

2   

  

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as 

  



legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur or by government enforcement proceedings alleging noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations 

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism cybersecurity attacks and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions due to concern over the risks of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes restrictive permitting increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy these requirements could make our products more expensive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations or policies may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

government sponsorship of alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies governments and others are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research both inhouse and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world including the massachusetts institute of technology princeton university the university of texas and stanford university our research projects focus on developing algaebased biofuels carbon capture and storage breakthrough energy efficiency processes advanced energysaving materials and other technologies for example exxonmobil is working with fuel cell energy inc to explore using carbonate fuel cells to economically capture co 2 emissions from gasfired power plants our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a costcompetitive manner see “operational and other factors” below 

  

operational and other factors 

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget 

project and portfolio management the longterm success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex long‑term capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role in addition to the effective management of individual projects exxonmobil’s success including our ability to mitigate risk and 

3   

  

provide attractive returns to shareholders depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio including diversification among types and locations of our projects 

the term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports 

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commodity‑based nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employees 

research and development to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended 

cybersecurity exxonmobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of threat actors if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient exxonmobil as well as our customers employees or third parties could be adversely affected such cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment damage or destroy assets compromise business systems result in proprietary information being altered lost or stolen result in employee customer or thirdparty information being compromised or otherwise disrupt our business operations we could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of such a cybersecurity disruption as well as in connection with resulting regulatory actions and litigation 

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our facilities are designed constructed and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties including those associated with wave wind and current intensity marine ice flow patterns permafrost stability storm surge magnitude temperature extremes extreme rain fall events and earthquakes our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning 

insurance limitations the ability of the corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this item 1a is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

competition as noted in item 1 above the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive we face competition not only from other private firms but also from stateowned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries in some cases these stateowned companies may pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders such as exxonmobil technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may not have the internal resources and capabilities of exxonmobil 

reputation our reputation is an important corporate asset an operating incident significant cybersecurity disruption or other adverse event such as those described in this item 1a may have a negative impact on our reputation which in turn could make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities obtain necessary regulatory approvals or could reduce consumer demand for our branded products 

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

1 disclosure of reserves 

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2017 

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2017 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 

  



  

1 other americas includes proved developed reserves of 2 million barrels of crude oil and 42 billion cubic feet of natural gas as well as proved undeveloped reserves of 150 million barrels of crude oil and 175 billion cubic feet of natural gas 

5   

  

  in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance performance of enhanced oil recovery projects regulatory changes the impact of fiscal and commercial terms asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment and other factors described in item 1a risk factors 

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals government policies consumer preferences and significant changes in longterm oil and natural gas price levels in addition proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects 

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2017 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2017 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing wellestablished technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 3d and 4d seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude oil natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the manager of the global reserves group has more than 25 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment and has a degree in engineering he is an active member of the society of petroleum engineers spe the group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines this group includes individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology and a member currently serves on the spe oil and gas reserves committee 

the global reserves group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement

  2 proved undeveloped reserves 

at yearend 2017 approximately 73 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 34 percent of the 212 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to the 62 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2016 during the year exxonmobil conducted development activities that resulted in the transfer of approximately 07 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year‑end the largest transfers were related to the startup of the gorgon field and longford gas conditioning plant in australia and drilling activity in the united states the united arab emirates and kazakhstan during 2017 extensions and discoveries primarily in the united arab emirates the united states and guyana resulted in an addition of approximately 09 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves also purchases primarily in the united states and mozambique resulted in the addition of approximately 09 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves 

overall investments of 8 billion were made by the corporation during 2017 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 8 billion for oil and gas producing activities and in addition nearly 100 million for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities these investments represented 48 percent of the 167 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures investments made by the corporation to develop quantities which no longer meet the sec definition of proved reserves due to 2017 average prices are included in the 167 billion of upstream capital expenditures reported above but are excluded from amounts related to progressing the development of proved undeveloped reserves 

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead‑time in order to be developed development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects proved undeveloped reserves in canada kazakhstan australia the netherlands the united states and qatar have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals government policies consumer preferences the pace of co‑venturergovernment funding and significant changes in longterm oil and natural gas price levels of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries in canada proved undeveloped reserves are related to drilling activities in the offshore hebron field and onshore cold lake operations in kazakhstan the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial development of the producing offshore kashagan field which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement and the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the tengiz – korolev field complex the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress in australia proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the gorgon jansz lng project in the netherlands the groningen gas field has proved undeveloped reserves related to installation of future compression

d summary of acreage terms united states 

oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease mineral interest owners include the federal and state governments as well as private mineral interest owners leases typically have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years and a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases under certain circumstances a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced in some instances regarding private property a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright 

canada  other americas 

canada 

exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible these licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work in general these license and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases exploration licenses in offshore eastern canada and the beaufort sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals they are valid for a maximum term of nine years offshore production licenses are valid for 25 years with rights of extension for continued production significant discovery licenses in the offshore relating to currently undeveloped discoveries do not have a definite term 

argentina 

the federal hydrocarbon law was amended in december 2014 the onshore concession terms granted prior to the amendment are up to six years divided into three potential exploration periods with an optional extension for up to one year depending on the classification of the area pursuant to the amended law the production term for a conventional production concession would be 25 years and 35 years for an unconventional concession with unlimited tenyear extensions possible once a field has been developed 

guyana 

the petroleum exploration and production act authorizes the government of guyana to grant petroleum prospecting and production licenses and to enter into petroleum agreements for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons petroleum agreements provide for an exploration period of up to 10 years with a production period of 20 years with a 10 year extension 

europe 

germany 

exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years with an unlimited number of extensions of up to three years each extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions as long as there is production on the license 

netherlands 

under the mining law effective january 1 2003 exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license the term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued license conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the mining law 

production rights granted prior to january 1 2003 remain subject to their existing terms and differ slightly for onshore and offshore areas onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license ranging from 35 to 45 years offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license ranging from 15 to 40 years 

norway 

licenses issued between 1972 and 1997 were for an initial period of up to six years with extension of the initial period of one year at a time up to ten years after 1985 and an extension period of up to 30 years with relinquishment of at least onehalf of the original area required at the end of the initial period licenses issued after july 1 1997 have an initial period of up to ten years and a normal extension period of up to 30 years or in special cases of up to 50 years and with relinquishment of at least onehalf of the original area required at the end of the initial period 

19   

  

united kingdom 

acreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed for example many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided for an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least onehalf of the original area at the end of the initial term subject to extension for a further 40 years at the end of any such 40year term licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a casebycase basis until they become producing areas or licenses terminate in all other areas the majority of traditional licenses currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years and a final production term of 18 years with a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term 

terms for exploration acreage in technically challenged areas are governed by frontier production licenses generally covering a larger initial area than traditional licenses with an initial exploration term of six or nine years with a second term extension of six years and a final production term of 18 years with relinquishment of 75 percent of the original area after three years and 50 percent of the remaining acreage after the next three years innovate licenses issued replace traditional and frontier licenses and offer greater flexibility with respect to periods and work program commitments

chad 

exploration permits are issued for a period of five years and are renewable for one or two further fiveyear periods the terms and conditions of the permits including relinquishment obligations are specified in a negotiated convention the production term is 30 years and in 2017 was extended by 20 years to 2050 

equatorial guinea 

exploration development and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts pscs negotiated with the state ministry of mines and hydrocarbons a new psc was signed in 2015 the initial exploration period is five years for oil and gas with multiyear extensions available at the discretion of the ministry and limited relinquishments in the absence of commercial discoveries the production period for crude oil ranges from 25 to 30 years while the production period for natural gas ranges from 25 to 50 years 

mozambique 

exploration and production activities are generally governed by concession contracts with the government of the republic of mozambique represented by the ministry of mineral resources and energy an interest in area 4 offshore mozambique was acquired in december 2017 terms for area 4 are governed by the exploration and production concession contract epcc for area 4 offshore of the rovuma block dated december 20 2006 and decree law 22014 the epcc expires 30 years after the approval of a plan of development for a given discovery area 

nigeria 

exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts pscs with the national oil company the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc nnpc typically holds the underlying oil prospecting license opl and any resulting oil mining lease oml the terms of the pscs are generally 30 years including a tenyear exploration period an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods covered by an opl upon commercial discovery an opl may be converted to an oml partial relinquishment is required under the psc at the end of the tenyear exploration period and omls have a 20year production period that may be extended 

some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an opl opls in deepwater offshore areas are valid for 10 years while in all other areas the licenses are for five years demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an opl to an oml 

omls granted prior to the 1969 petroleum act ie under the mineral oils act 1914 repealed by the 1969 petroleum act were for 30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed effective december 1 2008 for a further period of 20 years with a further renewal option of 20 years operations under these pre1969 omls are conducted under a joint venture agreement with nnpc rather than a psc commercial terms applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by the petroleum profits tax act 

20   

  

omls granted under the 1969 petroleum act which include all deepwater omls have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction for onshore or offshore location and are renewable upon 12 months’ written notice for another period of 20 years omls not held by nnpc are also subject to a mandatory 50percent relinquishment after the first 10 years of their duration

the production sharing agreement psa for the development of the azerichiraggunashli field is established for an initial period of 30 years starting from the psa execution date in 1994 the psa was amended in september 2017 to extend the term by 25 years to 2049 

other exploration and production activities are governed by psas negotiated with the national oil company of azerbaijan the exploration period typically consists of three or four years with the possibility of a one to threeyear extension the production period which includes development is for 25 years or 35 years with the possibility of one or two fiveyear extensions 

indonesia

 item 1 business 

exxon mobil corporation was incorporated in the state of new jersey in 1882 divisions and affiliated companies of exxonmobil operate or market products in the united states and most other countries of the world their principal business is energy involving exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas manufacture of petroleum products and transportation and sale of crude oil natural gas and petroleum products exxonmobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of commodity petrochemicals including olefins aromatics polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a wide variety of specialty products affiliates of exxonmobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses 

exxon mobil corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates many with names that include exxonmobil  exxon  esso mobil or xto  for convenience and simplicity in this report the terms exxonmobil exxon esso mobil and xto  as well as terms like corporation  company  our  we and its  are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates the precise meaning depends on the context in question 

throughout exxonmobil’s businesses new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air water and ground these include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions and expenditures for asset retirement obligations using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute exxonmobil’s 2016 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps including exxonmobil’s share of equity company expenditures were 49 billion of which 35 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures the total cost for such activities is expected to remain relatively flat at approximately 5 billion in 2017 and 2018 capital expenditures are expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total 

the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes 

operating data and industry segment information for the corporation are contained in the financial section of this report under the following “quarterly information” “note 18 disclosures about segments and related information” and “operating information” information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report 

exxonmobil has a long‑standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology we have a wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments information on company‑sponsored research and development spending is contained in “note 3 miscellaneous financial information” of the financial section of this report exxonmobil held nearly 12 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of 2016 for technology licensed to third parties revenues totaled approximately 104 million in 2016 although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our company the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent trade secret trademark license franchise or concession 

the number of regular employees was 711 thousand 735 thousand and 753 thousand at years ended 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively regular employees are defined as active executive management professional technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the corporation and are covered by the corporation’s benefit plans and programs regular employees do not include employees of the company‑operated retail sites cors the number of cors employees was 16 thousand 21 thousand and 84 thousand at years ended 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease in cors employees reflects the multi‑year transition of the company‑operated retail network to a more capital‑efficient branded wholesaler model

 item 1a risk factors 

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

supply and demand 

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the upstream segment financial condition and proved reserves on the other hand a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the downstream and chemical segments 

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for energy associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled or electric vehicles 

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to opec production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates inflation currency exchange rates and other local or regional market conditions we generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures 

  

government and political factors 

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

restrictions on doing business exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the us or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions 

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

2   

  

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as 

  



legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur or by government enforcement proceedings alleging noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations 

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions due to concern over the risk of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes restrictive permitting increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy these requirements could make our products more expensive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

government sponsorship of alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies governments and others are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research both inhouse and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world including the massachusetts institute of technology princeton university the university of texas and stanford university our research projects focus on developing algaebased biofuels carbon capture and storage breakthrough energy efficiency processes advanced energysaving materials and other technologies for example exxonmobil is working with fuel cell energy inc to explore using carbonate fuel cells to economically capture co 2 emissions from gasfired power plants our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a costcompetitive manner see “management effectiveness” below 

  

management effectiveness 

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget 

project management the success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex long‑term capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role 

3   

  

the term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports 

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commodity‑based nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employees 

research and development to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended the ability to insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity breaches if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient exxonmobil could be adversely affected such as by having its business systems compromised its proprietary information altered lost or stolen or its business operations disrupted 

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our facilities are designed constructed and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties including those associated with wave wind and current intensity marine ice flow patterns permafrost stability storm surge magnitude temperature extremes extreme rain fall events and earthquakes our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning 

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

1 disclosure of reserves 

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2016 

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period as a result of very low prices during 2016 under the sec definition of proved reserves certain quantities of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at yearend 2016 among the factors that would result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in average price levels a further decline in costs and  or operating efficiencies otherwise no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2016 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date

in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance performance of enhanced oil recovery projects regulatory changes the impact of fiscal and commercial terms asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment and other factors described in item 1a risk factors 

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and natural gas price levels in addition proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects 

as noted above certain quantities of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at yearend 2016 amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include the entire 35 billion barrels of bitumen at kearl in addition 08 billion barrels of oil equivalent across the remainder of north america no longer qualify as proved reserves mainly due to the acceleration of the projected endoffieldlife among the factors that would result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in average price levels a further decline in costs and  or operating efficiencies under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to exxonmobil we do not expect the downward revision of reported proved reserves under sec definitions to affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter our outlook for future production volumes 

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2016 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2016 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing wellestablished technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 3d and 4d seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude and natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the manager of the global reserves group has more than 25 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment and has a degree in engineering he is an active member of the society of petroleum engineers spe the group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines this group includes individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology several members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of expertise and a member currently serves on the spe oil and gas reserves committee 

6   

  

the global reserves group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement 

  2 proved undeveloped reserves 

at yearend 2016 approximately 62 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 31 percent of the 20 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to the 68 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2015 during the year exxonmobil conducted development activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of approximately 1 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year‑end the largest transfers were related to the gorgon lng project startup and drilling activity at upper zakum tengiz and in the united states during 2016 extensions primarily in the united states resulted in an addition of approximately 04 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves 

overall investments of 101 billion were made by the corporation during 2016 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 93 billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional 08 billion for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities these investments represented 70 percent of the 145 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures investments made by the corporation to develop quantities which no longer meet the sec definition of proved reserves due to 2016 average prices are included in the 145 billion of upstream capital expenditures reported above but are excluded from amounts related to progressing the development of proved undeveloped reserves 

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead‑time in order to be developed development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production however the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years proved undeveloped reserves in australia the united states kazakhstan the netherlands qatar and nigeria have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure the pace of co‑venturergovernment funding as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in longterm oil and natural gas price levels of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries the largest of these is related to lnggas projects in australia where construction of the gorgon lng project is in the final phases in kazakhstan the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial development of the offshore kashagan field which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement and the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the tengiz – korolev field complex the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress in the netherlands the groningen gas field has proved undeveloped reserves related to installation of future stages of compression these reserves will move to proved developed when the additional stages of compression are installed to maintain field delivery pressure

b exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources extracted by mining technologies 

syncrude operations syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen and then upgrade it to produce a highquality light 32 degrees api sweet synthetic crude oil imperial oil limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint venture exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited in 2016 the company’s share of net production of synthetic crude oil was about 67 thousand barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 63 thousand acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit 

kearl operations kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen imperial oil limited holds a 7096 percent interest in the joint venture and exxonmobil canada properties holds the other 2904 percent exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited and a 100 percent interest in exxonmobil canada properties kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit 

kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of fort mcmurray alberta canada bitumen is extracted from oil sands produced from openpit mining operations and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains the product a blend of bitumen and diluent is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail during 2016 average net production at kearl was about 167 thousand barrels per day 

as a result of very low prices during 2016 under the sec definition of proved reserves the entire 35 billion barrels of bitumen at kearl did not qualify as proved reserves at yearend 2016 among the factors that would result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in average price levels a further decline in costs and  or operating efficiencies

d summary of acreage terms 

united states 

oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired from mineral interest owners through a lease mineral interest owners include the federal and state governments as well as private mineral interest owners leases typically have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years and a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases under certain circumstances a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced in some instances regarding private property a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright 

canada  south america 

canada 

exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible these licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work in general these license and lease agreements are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and leases exploration licenses in offshore eastern canada and the beaufort sea are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals they are valid for a maximum term of nine years production licenses in the offshore are valid for 25 years with rights of extension for continued production significant discovery licenses in the offshore relating to currently undeveloped discoveries do not have a definite term 

argentina 

the federal hydrocarbon law was amended in december 2014 the onshore concession terms granted prior to the amendment are up to six years divided into three potential exploration periods with an optional extension for up to one year depending on the classification of the area pursuant to the amended law the production term for a conventional production concession would be 25 years and 35 years for an unconventional concession with unlimited tenyear extensions possible once a field has been developed

under the mining law effective january 1 2003 exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license the term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued license conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the mining law 

production rights granted prior to january 1 2003 remain subject to their existing terms and differ slightly for onshore and offshore areas onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license ranging from 35 to 45 years offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license ranging from 15 to 40 years 

norway 

licenses issued prior to 1972 were for an initial period of six years and an extension period of 40 years with relinquishment of at least onefourth of the original area required at the end of the sixth year and another onefourth at the end of the ninth year licenses issued between 1972 and 1997 were for an initial period of up to six years with extension of the initial period of one year at a time up to ten years after 1985 and an extension period of up to 30 years with relinquishment of at least onehalf of the original area required at the end of the initial period licenses issued after july 1 1997 have an initial period of up to ten years and a normal extension period of up to 30 years or in special cases of up to 50 years and with relinquishment of at least onehalf of the original area required at the end of the initial period

nigeria 

exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts pscs with the national oil company the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc nnpc typically holds the underlying oil prospecting license opl and any resulting oil mining lease oml the terms of the pscs are generally 30 years including a tenyear exploration period an initial exploration phase that can be divided into multiple optional periods covered by an opl upon commercial discovery an opl may be converted to an oml partial relinquishment is required under the psc at the end of the tenyear exploration period and omls have a 20year production period that may be extended 

some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an opl opls in deepwater offshore areas are valid for ten years while in all other areas the licenses are for five years demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an opl to an oml 

omls granted prior to the 1969 petroleum act ie under the mineral oils act 1914 repealed by the 1969 petroleum act were for 30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed effective december 1 2008 for a further period of 20 years with a further renewal option of 20 years operations under these pre1969 omls are conducted under a joint venture agreement with nnpc rather than a psc commercial terms applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by the petroleum profits tax act 

omls granted under the 1969 petroleum act which include all deepwater omls have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction for onshore or offshore location and are renewable upon 12 months’ written notice for another period of 20 years omls not held by nnpc are also subject to a mandatory 50percent relinquishment after the first ten years of their duration

 item 1 business 

exxon mobil corporation was incorporated in the state of new jersey in 1882 divisions and affiliated companies of exxonmobil operate or market products in the united states and most other countries of the world their principal business is energy involving exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas manufacture of petroleum products and transportation and sale of crude oil natural gas and petroleum products exxonmobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of commodity petrochemicals including olefins aromatics polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a wide variety of specialty products affiliates of exxonmobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses 

exxon mobil corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates many with names that include exxonmobil  exxon  esso mobil or xto  for convenience and simplicity in this report the terms exxonmobil exxon esso mobil and xto  as well as terms like corporation  company  our  we and its  are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates the precise meaning depends on the context in question 

throughout exxonmobil’s businesses new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air water and ground these include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions and expenditures for asset retirement obligations using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute exxonmobil’s 2015 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps including exxonmobil’s share of equity company expenditures were 56 billion of which 38 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures the total cost for such activities is expected to decrease to approximately 5 billion in 2016 and 2017 mainly reflecting lower project activity in canada capital expenditures are expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total 

the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes 

operating data and industry segment information for the corporation are contained in the financial section of this report under the following “quarterly information” “note 18 disclosures about segments and related information” and “operating summary” information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report 

exxonmobil has a long‑standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology we have a wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments information on company‑sponsored research and development spending is contained in “note 3 miscellaneous financial information” of the financial section of this report exxonmobil held approximately 11 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of 2015 for technology licensed to third parties revenues totaled approximately 158 million in 2015 although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our company the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent trade secret trademark license franchise or concession 

the number of regular employees was 735 thousand 753 thousand and 750 thousand at years ended 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively regular employees are defined as active executive management professional technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the corporation and are covered by the corporation’s benefit plans and programs regular employees do not include employees of the company‑operated retail sites cors the number of cors employees was 21 thousand 84 thousand and 98 thousand at years ended 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the decrease in cors employees reflects the multi‑year transition of the company‑operated retail network in portions of europe to a more capital‑efficient branded wholesaler model

 item 1a risk factors 

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

supply and demand 

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the upstream segment financial condition and proved reserves on the other hand a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the company’s operations especially in the downstream and chemical segments 

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for energy associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled or electric vehicles 

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to opec production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates inflation currency exchange rates and other local or regional market conditions we generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures 

government and political factors 

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

restrictions on doing business exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the us or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions 

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

2   

  

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as 

  



legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur or by government enforcement proceedings alleging noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations 

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions due to concern over the risk of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes restrictive permitting increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy these requirements could make our products more expensive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

government sponsorship of alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies governments are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research efforts into alternative energy such as through sponsorship of the global climate and energy project at stanford university and research into liquid products from algae and biomass that can be further converted to transportation fuels our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a costcompetitive manner see “management effectiveness” below 

management effectiveness 

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget 

project management the success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex longterm capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role 

3   

  

the term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports 

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commoditybased nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employees 

research and development to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended the ability to insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity breaches if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient exxonmobil could be adversely affected such as by having its business systems compromised its proprietary information altered lost or stolen or its business operations disrupted 

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our facilities are designed constructed and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions with safety factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties including those associated with wave wind and current intensity marine ice flow patterns permafrost stability storm surge magnitude temperature extremes extreme rain fall events and earthquakes our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning 

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

1 disclosure of reserves 

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2015 

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period when crude oil and natural gas prices are in the range seen in early 2016 for an extended period of time under the securities and exchange commission’s sec definition of proved reserves certain quantities of oil and natural gas could temporarily not qualify as proved reserves under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to exxonmobil otherwise no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2015 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 

  



  

1 south america includes proved developed reserves of 01 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 23 billion cubic feet of natural gas 

5   

  

in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance performance of enhanced oil recovery projects regulatory changes the impact of fiscal and commercial terms asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment and other factors described in item 1a risk factors 

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and natural gas price levels in addition proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects 

when crude oil and natural gas prices are in the range seen in late 2015 and early 2016 for an extended period of time under the sec definition of proved reserves certain quantities of oil and natural gas such as oil sands operations in canada and natural gas operations in north america could temporarily not qualify as proved reserves amounts that could be required to be debooked as proved reserves on an sec basis are subject to being rebooked as proved reserves at some point in the future when price levels recover costs decline or operating efficiencies occur under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to exxonmobil we do not expect any temporary changes in reported proved reserves under sec definitions to affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter our outlook for future production volumes 

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2015 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2015 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing wellestablished technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 3d and 4d seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude and natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the manager of the global reserves group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment and has a degree in engineering he is an active member of the society of petroleum engineers spe and previously served on the spe oil and gas reserves committee the group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines this group includes individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology several members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of expertise and a member currently serves on the spe oil and gas reserves committee 

6   

  

the global reserves group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement 

  2 proved undeveloped reserves 

at yearend 2015 approximately 68 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 27 percent of the 248 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to the 88 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2014 during the year exxonmobil conducted development activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of approximately 27 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by yearend the largest transfers were related to kearl expansion project startup and drilling activity in the united states mainly due to low prices during 2015 the corporation reclassified approximately 1 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves primarily natural gas reserves in the united states which no longer meet the sec definition of proved reserves 

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long leadtime in order to be developed development projects typically take two to four years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production however the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years during 2015 extensions and purchases primarily related to united states unconventional and abu dhabi drilling added approximately 17 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves overall investments of 194 billion were made by the corporation during 2015 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 17 billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional 24 billion for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities these investments represented 76 percent of the 254 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures 

proved undeveloped reserves in australia the united states kazakhstan the netherlands qatar and nigeria have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure the pace of coventurergovernment funding as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in longterm oil and natural gas price levels of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years 84 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries the largest of these is related to lnggas projects in australia where construction of the gorgon lng project is under way in kazakhstan the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial development of the offshore kashagan field which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement and the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the tengiz – korolev field complex the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress in the netherlands the groningen gas field has proved undeveloped reserves related to installation of future stages of compression these reserves will move to proved developed when the additional stages of compression are installed to maintain field delivery pressure

 item 1 business 

exxon mobil corporation was incorporated in the state of new jersey in 1882 divisions and affiliated companies of exxonmobil operate or market products in the united states and most other countries of the world their principal business is energy involving exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas manufacture of petroleum products and transportation and sale of crude oil natural gas and petroleum products exxonmobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of commodity petrochemicals including olefins aromatics polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a wide variety of specialty products affiliates of exxonmobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses 

exxon mobil corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates many with names that include exxonmobil  exxon  esso mobil or xto  for convenience and simplicity in this report the terms exxonmobil exxon esso mobil and xto  as well as terms like corporation  company  our  we and its  are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates the precise meaning depends on the context in question 

throughout exxonmobil’s businesses new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air water and ground these include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions and expenditures for asset retirement obligations using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute exxonmobil’s 2014 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps including exxonmobil’s share of equity company expenditures were 62 billion of which 35 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures the total cost for such activities is expected to remain in this range in 2015 and 2016 with capital expenditures approximately 40 percent of the total 

the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes

 item 1a risk factors 

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

supply and demand 

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity 

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for energy associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled vehicles 

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to opec production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates inflation currency exchange rates and other local or regional market conditions we generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures 

government and political factors 

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

restrictions on doing business exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the us or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions 

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

2   

  

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as 

  



legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur or by government enforcement proceedings alleging noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations 

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions due to concern over the risk of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes restrictive permitting increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy these requirements could make our products more expensive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

government sponsorship of alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies governments are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research efforts into alternative energy such as through sponsorship of the global climate and energy project at stanford university and research into liquid products from algae and biomass that can be further converted to transportation fuels our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a costcompetitive manner see “management effectiveness” below 

management effectiveness 

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line on schedule and within budget 

project management the success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex longterm capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role 

3   

  

the term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports 

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commoditybased nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employees 

research and development to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment 

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended the ability to insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity breaches if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient exxonmobil could be adversely affected such as by having its business systems compromised its proprietary information altered lost or stolen or its business operations disrupted 

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our rigorous disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning 

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows 

  

1 disclosure of reserves 

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2014 

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2014 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 

  



  

1 south america includes proved developed reserves of 02 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 39 billion cubic feet of natural gas and proved undeveloped reserves of 7 billion cubic feet of natural gas 

5   

  

in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity to grow over the coming years however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes the impact of fiscal and commercial terms asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in item 1a—risk factors of this report 

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and gas price levels 

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2014 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2014 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing wellestablished technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 3d and 4d seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude and natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the manager of the global reserves group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment and has a degree in engineering he is an active member of the society of petroleum engineers spe and previously served on the spe oil and gas reserves committee the group is managed by and staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines this group includes individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology several members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of expertise and members have served on the spe oil and gas reserves committee 

the global reserves group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement

  2 proved undeveloped reserves 

at yearend 2014 approximately 88 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 35 percent of the 253 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to the 85 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2013 during the year exxonmobil conducted development activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of approximately 08 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by yearend the largest transfers were related to papua new guinea png lng startup and drilling activity in the united states 

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long leadtime in order to be developed development projects typically take two to four years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production however the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years during 2014 discoveries and extensions related to new projects added approximately 06 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves the largest of these additions were related to planned drilling in the united states and project funding in angola russia and kazakhstan overall investments of 242 billion were made by the corporation during 2014 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 224 billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional 18 billion for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities these investments represented 74 percent of the 327 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures 

proved undeveloped reserves in australia the united states kazakhstan nigeria and the netherlands have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure the pace of coventurergovernment funding as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in longterm oil and gas price levels of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years 84 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries the largest of these is related to lnggas projects in australia where construction of the gorgon lng project is under way in kazakhstan the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial development of the offshore kashagan field which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement and the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the tengiz – korolev field complex the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress in the netherlands the groningen gas field has proved undeveloped reserves reported that are related to installation of future stages of compression these reserves will move to proved developed when the additional stages of compression are installed to maintain field delivery pressure

 item 1a risk factors 

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

supply and demand 

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity 

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for energy associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled vehicles 

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to opec production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates inflation currency exchange rates and other local or regional market conditions we generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures 

government and political factors 

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

restrictions on doing business as a us company exxonmobil is subject to laws prohibiting us companies from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to our nonus competitors unless their own home countries impose comparable restrictions 

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

2   

  

 

  

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as 

  



legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur or by government enforcement proceedings alleging noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations 

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions due to concern over the risk of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes restrictive permitting increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy these requirements could make our products more expensive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

government sponsorship of alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies governments are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research efforts into alternative energy such as through sponsorship of the global climate and energy project at stanford university and research into liquid products from algae and biomass that can be further converted to transportation fuels our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a costcompetitive manner see “management effectiveness” below 

management effectiveness 

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line on schedule and within budget 

project management the success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex longterm capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role 

3   

  

 

  

the term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports 

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commoditybased nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employees 

research and development to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment 

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended the ability to insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity breaches if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient exxonmobil could be adversely affected such as by having its business systems compromised its proprietary information altered lost or stolen or its business operations disrupted 

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our rigorous disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning 

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

1 disclosure of reserves 

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2013 

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2013 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 

  



  

1 south america includes proved developed reserves of 02 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 44 billion cubic feet of natural gas and proved undeveloped reserves of 01 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas 

5   

  

 

  

  

in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity to grow over the period 20142018 however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in item 1a—risk factors of this report 

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and gas price levels 

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2013 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2013 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing wellestablished technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 2d and 3d seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude and natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the manager of the global reserves group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment and has a degree in engineering he is an active member of the society of petroleum engineers spe and previously served on the spe oil and gas reserves committee the group is managed by and staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines this group includes individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology several members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of expertise and members have served on the spe oil and gas reserves committee 

the global reserves group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement

  2 proved undeveloped reserves 

at yearend 2013 approximately 85 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 34 percent of the 252 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to the 99 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2012 the net decrease is primarily due to project startups in canada and kazakhstan during the year exxonmobil conducted development activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of approximately 19 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by yearend the largest transfers were related to kearl initial development startup and new pad steam injection in the cold lake field in canada kashagan field startup in kazakhstan and the groningen compression assessment in the netherlands 

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long leadtime in order to be developed development projects typically take two to four years from the time of first recording of proved reserves to the start of production of these reserves however the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years during 2013 discoveries and extensions related to new projects added approximately 07 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves the largest of these additions were related to planned drilling in the united states and upper zakum field expansion in abu dhabi overall investments of 253 billion were made by the corporation during 2013 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 227 billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional 26 billion for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities that were undertaken to progress the development of proved undeveloped reserves these investments represented 66 percent of the 382 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures 

proved undeveloped reserves in australia papua new guinea the united states kazakhstan nigeria and the netherlands have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure the pace of coventurergovernment funding as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in longterm oil and gas price levels of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years 91 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries the largest of these is related to lnggas projects in australia and papua new guinea where construction of the initial development is under way in kazakhstan the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial development of the offshore kashagan field which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement and the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the tengiz – korolev field complex the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress in the netherlands the groningen gas field has proved undeveloped reserves reported that are related to installation of future stages of compression these reserves will move to proved developed when the additional stages of compression are installed to maintain field delivery pressure

 item 1a risk factors 

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

supply and demand 

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity 

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for energy associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled vehicles 

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to opec production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates inflation currency exchange rates and other local or regional market conditions we generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures 

government and political factors 

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

restrictions on doing business as a us company exxonmobil is subject to laws prohibiting us companies from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to our nonus competitors unless their own home countries impose comparable restrictions 

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

2   

  

 

  

  

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as 

  



legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or other legal proceedings especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur 

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions due to concern over the risk of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes restrictive permitting increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy these requirements could make our products more expensive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

government sponsorship of alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies governments are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research efforts into alternative energy such as through sponsorship of the global climate and energy project at stanford university and research into fuelproducing algae our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the future in a costcompetitive manner see “management effectiveness” below 

management effectiveness 

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line on schedule and within budget 

project management the success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex longterm capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role

the term “project” as used in this report does not necessarily have the same meaning as under sec rule 13q1 relating to government payment reporting for example a single project for purposes of the rule may encompass numerous properties agreements investments developments phases work efforts activities and components each of which we may also informally describe as a “project” 

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commoditybased nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employees 

research and development to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment 

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended the ability to insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity breaches if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient exxonmobil could be adversely affected such as by having its business systems compromised its proprietary information altered lost or stolen or its business operations disrupted 

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our rigorous disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning 

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

1 disclosure of reserves 

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2012 

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2012 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 

  



  

1 south america includes proved developed reserves of 04 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 57 billion cubic feet of natural gas and proved undeveloped reserves of 06 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 65 billion cubic feet of natural gas 

5   

  

 

  

  

in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity to grow over the period 20132017 however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in item 1a—risk factors of this report 

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and gas price levels 

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2012 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2012 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing wellestablished technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 2d and 3d seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude and natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the group is managed by and staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines this group includes individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology several members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of expertise and several have served on the oil and gas reserves committee of the society of petroleum engineers 

the global reserves group maintains a central database containing the official company global reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement 

  

2 proved undeveloped reserves 

at yearend 2012 approximately 99 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 39 percent of the 252 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to the 88 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2011 the net increase is primarily due to the addition of new projects in 

6   

  

 

  

canada and the united states during the year exxonmobil conducted development activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of approximately 05 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by yearend the largest transfers were related to completion of drilling and the initiation of production activities in unconventional fields in the united states and on new pad locations in the cold lake field in canada 

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long leadtime in order to be developed development projects typically take two to four years from the time of first recording of proved reserves to the start of production of these reserves however the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years during 2012 discoveries and extensions related to new projects added approximately 13 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves the largest of these additions were related to planned drilling in the united states overall investments of 248 billion were made by the corporation during 2012 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 217 billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional 31 billion for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities that were undertaken to progress the development of proved undeveloped reserves these investments represented 69 percent of the 361 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures 

proved undeveloped reserves in canada kazakhstan the united states and the netherlands have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure and the pace of coventurergovernment funding as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance and regulatory approvals of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years 57 percent are contained in four fields in canada kazakhstan and the netherlands the largest of these is related to the kearl project in canada where construction of the initial development was completed during 2012 and phased startup activities were under way in kazakhstan the proved undeveloped reserves are related to the initial development of the offshore kashagan field which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement and the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the tengiz – korolev field complex the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress the fourth field is the groningen gas field in the netherlands proved undeveloped reserves reported for this field are related to installation of future stages of compression these reserves will move to proved developed when the additional stages of compression are installed to maintain field delivery pressure the remainder of proved undeveloped reserves are contained in over 140 fields in 16 countries

 item 1a risk factors tableend exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

supply and demand 

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity 

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates periods of civil unrest government austerity programs or currency exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals sovereign debt downgrades defaults inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints liquidity crises the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political systems such as the european union and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for energy associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled vehicles 

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to opec production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates inflation and other local or regional market conditions we generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures 

government and political factors 

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

restrictions on doing business as a us company exxonmobil is subject to laws prohibiting us companies from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to our nonus competitors unless their own home countries impose comparable restrictions 

  

index to financial statements lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as 

 

      legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate 

we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or other legal proceedings especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur 

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions due to concern over the risk of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes restrictive permitting increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy these requirements could make our products more expensive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shifting hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

government sponsorship of alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies and mandates to make alternative energy sources more competitive against oil and gas governments are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research efforts into alternative energy such as through sponsorship of the global climate and energy project at stanford university and research into hydrogen fuel cells and fuelproducing algae our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the competitive energy products of the future see “management effectiveness” below 

management effectiveness 

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line on schedule 

project management the success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex longterm capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including 

  

index to financial statements costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role 

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commoditybased nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements and regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio 

research and development to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment 

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended the ability to insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity breaches if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient exxonmobil could be adversely affected such as by having its business systems compromised its proprietary information altered lost or stolen or its business operations disrupted 

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our rigorous disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning 

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

1 disclosure of reserves 

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2011 

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2011 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 

 

  

   

index to financial statements in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity to grow over the period 20122016 however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in item 1a—risk factors of this report 

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and gas price levels 

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2011 

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2011 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing wellestablished technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 2d and 3d seismic data calibrated with available well control information where applicable surface geological information was also utilized the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

exxonmobil has a dedicated reserves technical oversight group that is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude and natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the group is managed by and staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines this group includes several individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology as well as individuals who hold bachelor’s degrees in various technical disciplines several members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of expertise and several have served on the oil and gas reserves committee of the society of petroleum engineers 

the reserves technical oversight group maintains a central computerized database containing the official company global reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central computerized database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the reserves technical oversight group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement 

  

index to financial statements 2 proved undeveloped reserves 

at yearend 2011 approximately 88 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 35 percent of the 249 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to the 77 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2010 the net increase of 11 goeb is primarily due to the addition of new projects in canada and the united states during the year exxonmobil conducted development activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of approximately 05 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by yearend the largest individual transfer was related to completion of drilling and the initiation of production activities on new pad locations in the cold lake field in canada 

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long leadtime in order to be developed development projects typically take two to four years from the time of first recording of proved reserves to the start of production of these reserves however the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years during 2011 discoveries and extensions related to new projects added approximately 15 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves the largest of these additions were related to the kearl expansion project in canada and additions for planned drilling in the united states overall investments of 231 billion were made by the corporation during 2011 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 205 billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional 26 billion for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of lng trains support infrastructure and other related facilities that were undertaken to progress the development of proved undeveloped reserves these investments represented 70 percent of the 331 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures 

proved undeveloped reserves in the united states kazakhstan the netherlands nigeria and canada have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure and the pace of coventurergovernment funding as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance and regulatory approvals approximately onethird of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years are located in three fields in kazakhstan and the netherlands in kazakhstan the first is the initial development of the giant offshore kashagan field which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement in which exxonmobil participates the second is the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the tengiz field and the nearby korolev field the joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress the third is the groningen gas field in the netherlands proved undeveloped reserves reported for this field are related to installation of future stages of compression these reserves will move to proved developed when the additional stages of compression are installed to maintain field delivery pressure

united states 

oil and gas leases have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years and a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases under certain circumstances a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced in some instances a “fee interest” is acquired where both the surface and the underlying mineral interests are owned outright 

canada  south america 

canada 

exploration licenses or leases are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible exploration rights in onshore areas acquired from canadian provinces entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work in general license and lease agreements are held as long as there is production on the licenses and leases the majority of cold lake leases are held in this manner the exploration acreage in eastern canada and the block in the beaufort sea acquired in 2007 are currently held by work commitments of various amounts 

argentina 

the federal onshore concession terms in argentina are up to four years for the initial exploration period up to three years for the second exploration period and up to two years for the third exploration period a 50percent relinquishment is required after each exploration period an extension after the third exploration period is possible for up to five years the total production term is 25 years with a tenyear extension possible once a field has been developed argentine provinces are entitled to modify the concession terms granted within their territories the concession terms of the exploration permits granted by neuquen province are up to six years for the initial exploration period up to four years for the second exploration period and up to three years for the third exploration period depending on the classification of the area an extension after the third exploration period is possible for up to one year

some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an opl opls in deepwater offshore areas are valid for ten years and are nonrenewable while in all other areas the licenses are for five years and also are nonrenewable demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an opl to an oml 

omls granted prior to the 1969 petroleum act ie under the mineral oils act 1914 repealed by the 1969 petroleum act were for 30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed effective december 1 2008 for a further period of 20 years with a further renewal option of 20 years operations under these pre1969 omls are conducted under a joint venture agreement with nnpc rather than a psc in 2000 a memorandum of understanding mou was executed defining commercial terms applicable to existing joint venture oil production the mou may be terminated on one calendar year’s notice 

omls granted under the 1969 petroleum act which include all deepwater omls have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction for onshore or offshore location and are renewable upon 12 months’ written notice for another period of 20 years omls not held by nnpc are also subject to a mandatory 50percent relinquishment after the first ten years of their duration

 item 1a risk factors  tableend   

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these risk factors include 

  

supply and demand 

  

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity 

  

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates or periods of civil unrest also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals economic conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

  

index to financial statements other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for energy associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled vehicles 

  

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to opec production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions natural disasters disruptions in competitors’ operations or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

  

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in currency exchange rates interest rates inflation and other local or regional market conditions we generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures 

  

government and political factors 

  

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

  

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

  

restrictions on doing business as a us company exxonmobil is subject to laws prohibiting us companies from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to our nonus competitors unless their own home countries impose comparable restrictions 

  

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

  

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as increases in taxes or government royalty rates including retroactive claims price controls changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunities including changes in laws related to offshore drilling operations water use or hydraulic 

  

index to financial statements fracturing adoption of regulations mandating the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components government actions to cancel contracts or renegotiate terms unilaterally and expropriation legal remedies available to compensate us for expropriation or other takings may be inadequate we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or other legal proceedings especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur 

  

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

  

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions due to concern over the risk of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes restrictive permitting increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy these requirements could make our products more expensive lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shifting hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

  

government sponsorship of alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies and mandates to make alternative energy sources more competitive against oil and gas governments are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research efforts into alternative energy such as through sponsorship of the global climate and energy project at stanford university and research into hydrogen fuel cells and fuelproducing algae our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the competitive energy products of the future see “management effectiveness” below 

  

management effectiveness 

  

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition for projects in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more coventurers whom we do not control 

  

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line on schedule 

  

project management the success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex longterm capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled 

  

index to financial statements project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role 

  

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commoditybased nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements and regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio 

  

research and development to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment 

  

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations and to control effectively our business activities we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended the ability to insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets which may not be sufficient 

  

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters human error and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our rigorous disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning 

  

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2010 

  

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2010 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 

  

   

    

index to financial statements in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

  

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity to grow over the period 20112015 however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in item 1a—risk factors of this report 

  

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and gas price levels 

  

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2010 

  

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2010 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing well established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

  

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 2d and 3d seismic data calibrated with available well control information where applicable surface geological information was also utilized the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

  

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

  

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

  

exxonmobil has a dedicated reserves technical oversight group that is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude and natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the group is managed by and staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines this group includes several individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology as well as individuals who hold bachelor’s degrees in various technical disciplines several members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of expertise and several have served on the oil and gas reserves committee of the society of petroleum engineers 

  

index to financial statements the reserves technical oversight group maintains a central computerized database containing the official company global reserves estimates appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central computerized database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the reserves technical oversight group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement 

  

2 proved undeveloped reserves 

  

at yearend 2010 approximately 77 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped this represents 31 percent of the 248 goeb reported in proved reserves and includes approximately 10 goeb of new proved undeveloped reserves related to the acquisition of xto this compares to the 75 goeb proved undeveloped or 33 percent of the proved reserves reported at the end of 2009 the net reduction in the percentage of proved undeveloped reserves from 2009 is reflective of our active development programs on many projects worldwide which made significant progress in converting proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves in 2010 during the year exxonmobil completed development work in over 80 fields and participated in major project startups that resulted in the transfer of approximately 14 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by yearend this represented the movement of 18 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves into the proved developed category or an average turnover time of about five years the largest individual transfer was associated with the completion and startup of the ras laffan 3 train 7 liquefied natural gas lng train in qatar 

  

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require a long leadtime in order to be developed development projects typically take two to four years from the time of first recording of proved reserves to the start of production of these reserves however the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years during 2010 new approved projects added approximately 02 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves the largest of these was the sakhalin 1 arkutun dagi development in russia overall investments of 194 billion were made by the corporation during 2010 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 168 billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional 26 billion for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of lng trains tankers and regasification facilities that were undertaken to progress the development of proved undeveloped reserves these investments represented 71 percent of the 273 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures 

  

proved undeveloped reserves in kazakhstan netherlands united states nigeria and canada have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure and the pace of coventuregovernment funding as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance and regulatory approvals 

  

index to financial statements approximately one third of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years are in kazakhstan and are related to two separate developments the first is the initial development of the giant offshore kashagan field which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement in which exxonmobil participates the second is the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the tengiz field and the nearby korolev field the joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress

 item 1a risk factors  tableend   

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition we discuss some of these risks in more detail below 

  

supply and demand 

  

the oil gas and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses this means exxonmobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity 

  

economic conditions the demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with general economic growth rates the occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region such as changes in population growth rates or periods of civil unrest also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals economic conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil 

  

index to financial statements other demandrelated factors other factors that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemicals and therefore impact our results include technological improvements in energy efficiency seasonal weather patterns which affect the demand for energy associated with heating and cooling increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices such as toward alternative fueled vehicles 

  

other supplyrelated factors commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to reduce margins on the affected products world oil gas and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies such as adherence by member countries to opec production quotas and the occurrence of wars hostile actions or natural disasters that may disrupt supplies technological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemicals 

  

other market factors exxonmobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in currency exchange rates interest rates inflation and other local or regional market conditions we generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures 

  

government and political factors 

  

exxonmobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations 

  

access limitations a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources or may place resources offlimits from development altogether restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices when national governments may have less need of outside sources of private capital many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin 

  

restrictions on doing business as a us company exxonmobil is subject to laws prohibiting us companies from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to our nonus competitors unless their own home countries impose comparable restrictions 

  

lack of legal certainty some countries in which we do business lack welldeveloped legal systems or have not yet adopted clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts in some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award 

  

regulatory and litigation risks even in countries with welldeveloped legal systems where exxonmobil does business we remain exposed to changes in law including changes that result from international treaties and accords that could adversely affect our results such as increases in taxes or government royalty rates including retroactive claims price controls changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance adoption of regulations mandating the use of alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components government actions to cancel contracts or renegotiate terms unilaterally and expropriation legal remedies available to compensate us for 

  

index to financial statements expropriation or other takings may be inadequate we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or other legal proceedings especially in countries such as the united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur 

  

security concerns successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time 

  

climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions due to concern over the risk of climate change a number of countries have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these include adoption of cap and trade regimes carbon taxes increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy these requirements could make our products more expensive and reduce demand for hydrocarbons as well as shifting hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lowercarbon sources such as natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions 

  

government sponsorship of alternative energy many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies and mandates to make alternative energy sources more competitive against oil and gas governments are also promoting research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources we are conducting our own research efforts into alternative energy such as through sponsorship of the global climate and energy project at stanford university and research into hydrogen fuel cells and fuelproducing algae our future results may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the competitive energy products of the future see “management effectiveness” below 

  

management effectiveness 

  

in addition to external economic and political factors our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition 

  

exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts among other factors we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line on schedule 

  

project management the success of exxonmobil’s upstream downstream and chemical businesses depends on complex longterm capital intensive projects these projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers partners governments suppliers customers or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop markets for project outputs whether through longterm contracts or the development of effective spot markets manage changes in operating conditions and costs including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role 

  

operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil’s competitive performance especially given the commoditybased nature of many of our businesses is our ability to operate 

  

index to financial statements efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements and regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio 

  

research and development to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil’s research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment 

  

safety business controls and environmental risk management our results depend on management’s ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil gas and petrochemical operations and to control effectively our business activities we apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other adverse environmental events for example we work to minimize spills through a combined program of effective operations integrity management ongoing upgrades key equipment replacements and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing costeffective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions not only in response to government requirements but also to address community priorities we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management systems and controls do not function as intended 

  

preparedness our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events natural disasters and similar events for example hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our rigorous disaster preparedness and business continuity planning 

  

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 1a 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows 

  

1 disclosure of reserves 

  

a summary of oil and gas reserves at yearend 2009 

  

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month during the last 12month period gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2009 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date 

  

    

index to financial statements in the preceding reserves information consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

  

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity to grow over the period 20102014 however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in item 1a—risk factors of this report 

  

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and gas price levels 

  

b technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2009 

  

additions to exxonmobil’s proved reserves in 2009 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate data utilizing well established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results 

  

data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such as well logs reservoir core samples fluid samples static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including highquality 2d and 3d seismic data calibrated with available well control where applicable surface geological information was also utilized the tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis packages 

  

in some circumstances where appropriate analog reservoirs were available reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates 

  

c qualifications of reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves 

  

exxonmobil has a dedicated reserves technical oversight group that is separate from the operating organization primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of exxonmobil’s proved reserves this group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for exxonmobil’s proved reserves of crude and natural gas liquids bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates the group is managed by and staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines this group includes several individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology as well as individuals who hold bachelor’s degrees in various technical disciplines several members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of expertise and several have served on the oil and gas reserves committee of the society of petroleum engineers 

  

index to financial statements the reserves technical oversight group maintains a central computerized database containing the official company global reserves estimates and production data appropriate controls including limitations on database access and update capabilities are in place to ensure data integrity within this central computerized database an annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization in addition changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database endorsement by the reserves technical oversight group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process after all changes are made reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement 

  

2 proved undeveloped reserves 

  

at yearend 2009 approximately 75 billion oilequivalent barrels goeb of exxonmobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped which represented 33 percent of the 230 goeb reported in proved reserves this compares to 38 percent proved undeveloped reported at the end of 2008 the net reduction from 2008 is reflective of our active development programs on many projects worldwide this percentage is inclusive of both consolidated subsidiaries and equity company reserves significant progress was made in converting proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves in 2009 during the year exxonmobil completed development work in over 100 fields and participated in numerous major project startups that resulted in the transfer of approximately 24 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by yearend this represented the movement of 28 percent of the proved undeveloped reserves into the proved developed category or an average turnover time of about four years the largest transfers were associated with two liquefied natural gas lng trains and the second phase of a domestic gas supply project in qatar 

  

one of exxonmobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require a long leadtime in order to be developed development projects typically take two to four years from the time of first recording of proved reserves to the start of production of these reserves however the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years during 2009 new approved projects added approximately 13 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves the largest of these were the gorgon lng project in australia and the papua new guinea lng project overall investments of 127 billion were made by the corporation during 2009 to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves including 116 billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional 11 billion for other nonoil and gas producing activities such as the construction of lng trains tankers and regasification facilities that were undertaken to progress the development of proved undeveloped reserves these investments represented 61 percent of the 207 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures 

  

proved undeveloped reserves in the united states kazakhstan qatar nigeria netherlands and canada have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure and the pace of coventurersgovernment funding as well as the time required to develop and complete the projects the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance and regulatory approvals the two largest projects that have been reported with proved undeveloped reserves for five or more years

kearl project 

  

the kearl oil sands project is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen imperial oil limited holds a 7096 percent interest in the joint venture and exxonmobil canada properties holds the other 2904 percent exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited and a 100 percent interest in exxonmobil canada properties the kearl project is located approximately 40 miles north of fort mcmurray alberta canada 

  

kearl is expected to be developed in phases bitumen will be extracted from oil sands produced from openpit mining operations and processed through a bitumen extraction and froth treatment plant the product a blend of bitumen and diluent is planned to be shipped via pipelines for distribution to north american markets diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation to market by pipeline 

  

the kearl project received approvals from the province of alberta in 2007 and the government of canada in 2008 the province of alberta issued an operating and construction license in 2008 which permits the project to mine oil sands and produce bitumen from approved development areas on oil sands leases kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 48000 acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit 

  

production from the first phase is expected to be at an initial rate of approximately 110000 gross barrels of bitumen a day about 2 billion has been spent on the project through 2009 in 2009 pipeline transportation agreements were concluded infrastructure construction continued and more than half of the detailed engineering was completed

 item 11 executive compensation 

  

reference is made to the sections entitled “director compensation” “compensation committee report” “compensation discussion and analysis” and “executive compensation tables” of the proxy information section of this report 

  

the compensation committee determines whether exxonmobil’s compensation policies and practices could result in inappropriate risktaking based on it’s assessment the committee does not believe that exxonmobil’s compensation policies and practices create any material adverse risks for the company for the following reasons 

  

inappropriate risktaking is discouraged by requiring senior executives to hold a substantial portion of their equity incentive award for their entire career and beyond retirement these lengthy holding periods are tailored to our business model the compensation committee requires that these equity grants with long holding periods comprise 50 to 70 percent of total compensation for named executive officers as depicted on page 133 of the “compensation discussion and analysis” whereas the annual bonus award was only about 10 percent of total annual compensation in 2009 

  

payout of 50 percent of the annual bonus is delayed and subject to risk of forfeiture which is a unique feature of the annual bonus program relative to many comparator companies and further discourages inappropriate risktaking the timing of the delayed payout is determined by earnings performance 

  

executives below the named executive officers participate in the same plans which are also reviewed by the compensation committee therefore inappropriate risktaking is discouraged at all levels of the company through similar compensation design features and allocation of awards 

  

finally it should also be noted that a large percentage of career compensation for all executives and employees is in the form of a defined benefit pension which requires many years of dedicated service to the company to have material value and is based on a standard retirement age of 65 with early retirement eligibility at age 55 with a minimum of 15 years of service this is another dimension of total compensation that discourages inappropriate risktaking instead it encourages executives to take a longterm view when making business decisions and to focus on achieving sustainable growth for shareholders

 item 1a risk factors  tableend   

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil and gas business many of these risk factors are not within the company’s control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating results or our financial condition these factors include the following 

  

industry and economic factors the oil and gas business is fundamentally a commodity business this means the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on gasoline and other refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity these events or conditions are generally not predictable and include among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

under certain market conditions factors that have a positive impact on one segment of our business may have a negative impact on another segment and vice versa 

  

competitive factors the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes 

  

a key component of the corporation’s competitive position particularly given the commoditybased nature of many of its businesses is exxonmobil’s ability to manage expenses successfully this requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency including through technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements and regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio 

  

index to financial statements political and legal factors the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to time in varying degree by political and legal factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

both the likelihood of these occurrences and their overall effect upon the corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 

  

project factors in addition to some of the factors cited above exxonmobil’s results depend upon the corporation’s ability to develop and operate major projects and facilities as planned the corporation’s results will therefore be affected by events or conditions that impact the advancement operation cost or results of such projects or facilities including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity to grow over the period 20092013 however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors described above 

  

index to financial statements the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and gas price levels 

  

market risk factors   

  

   

crude oil natural gas petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in response to changing market forces the impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings from upstream downstream and chemical operations have varied in the upstream a 1 per barrel change in the weightedaverage realized price of oil would have approximately a 375 million annual aftertax effect on upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings similarly a 010 per kcf change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a 175 million annual aftertax effect on upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings for any given period the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil taxes and other government take impacts price adjustment lags in longterm gas contracts and crude and gas production volumes accordingly changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period 

  

in the very competitive downstream and chemical environments earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of products sold refining margins are a function of the difference between what a refiner pays for its raw materials primarily crude oil and the market prices for the range of products produced these prices in turn depend on global and regional supplydemand balances inventory levels refinery operations importexport balances and weather 

  

the global energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are adverse to one or more of the corporation’s businesses such conditions along with the capitalintensive nature of the industry and very long lead times associated with many of our projects underscore the importance of maintaining a strong financial position management views the corporation’s financial strength including the aaa and aaa ratings of its longterm debt securities by standard  poor’s and moody’s as a competitive advantage 

  

in general segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell andor purchase products tofrom other segments instead where such sales take place they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of integrated refinerychemical complexes additionally intersegment sales are at marketbased prices the products bought and sold between segments can also be acquired in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity capacity and transportation capabilities about 40 percent of the corporation’s intersegment sales are crude oil produced by the upstream and sold to the downstream other intersegment sales include those between refineries and chemical plants related to raw materials feedstocks and finished products 

  

index to financial statements although price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over the short to medium term due to political events opec actions and other factors industry economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand accordingly the corporation tests the viability of all of its investments over a broad range of future prices the corporation’s assessment is that its operations will continue to be successful in a variety of market conditions this is the outcome of disciplined investment and asset management programs investment opportunities are tested against a variety of market conditions including lowprice scenarios 

  

the corporation has an active asset management program in which underperforming assets are either improved to acceptable levels or considered for divestment the asset management program includes a disciplined regular review to ensure that all assets are contributing to the corporation’s strategic objectives the result is an efficient capital base and the corporation has seldom had to write down the carrying value of assets even during periods of low commodity prices 

  

risk management 

  

the corporation’s size strong capital structure geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the upstream downstream and chemical businesses reduce the corporation’s enterprisewide risk from changes in interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as a result the corporation makes limited use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of such changes the corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with leveraged features the corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization reporting and monitoring of derivative activity the corporation’s limited derivative activities pose no material credit or market risks to exxonmobil’s operations financial condition or liquidity “note 12 financial instruments and derivatives” of the financial section of this report summarizes the fair value of derivatives outstanding at year end and the gains or losses that have been recognized in net income 

  

the corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily on its shortterm debt and the portion of longterm debt that carries floating interest rates the impact of a 100basispoint change in interest rates affecting the corporation’s debt would not be material to earnings cash flow or fair value the corporation’s cash balances exceeded total debt at yearend 2008 and 2007 during 2008 credit markets tightened and the global economy slowed the corporation is not dependent on the credit markets to fund current operations however some jointventure partners are dependent on the credit markets and their funding ability may impact the development pace of jointventure projects 

  

the corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales expenses financing and investment transactions the impacts of fluctuations in exchange rates on exxonmobil’s geographically and functionally diverse operations are varied and often offsetting in amount the corporation makes limited use of currency exchange contracts commodity forwards swaps and futures contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values and commodity prices exposures related to the corporation’s limited use of the above contracts are not material 

  

inflation and other uncertainties 

  

the general rate of inflation in many major countries of operation increased in 2008 versus the relatively low rates in recent years and the associated impact on nonenergy costs has generally been mitigated by cost reductions from efficiency and productivity improvements increased global 

  

index to financial statements demand for certain services and materials has resulted in higher operating and capital costs in recent years the corporation works to counter upward pressure on costs through its economies of scale in global procurement and its efficient project management practices 

  

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

index to financial statements additional detail on developed and undeveloped oilequivalent proved reserves is shown in the table below 

  

   

in the preceding reserves information and in the reserves tables in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

  

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity to grow over the period 20092013 however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in item 1a—risk factors of this report 

  

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and gas price levels 

  

2 estimates of total net proved oil and gas reserves filed with other federal agencies 

  

during 2008 exxonmobil filed proved reserves estimates with the us department of energy on forms eia23 and eia28 the information on form eia28 is presented on the same basis as the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2007 which shows exxonmobil’s net interests in all liquids and gas reserve volumes and changes thereto from both exxonmobiloperated properties and properties operated by others the data on form eia23 although consistent with the data on form eia28 is presented on a different basis and includes 100 percent of the oil and gas volumes from exxonmobiloperated properties only regardless of the company’s net interest in addition 

  

index to financial statements form eia23 information does not include gas plant liquids the difference between the oil reserves and gas reserves reported on eia23 and those reported in the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2007 exceeds five percent 

  

3 average sales prices and production costs per unit of production 

  

reference is made to the “results of operations” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the corporation’s own production as the divisor average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids ngl production used for this computation are shown in the reserves table in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report the volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and thus are different from those shown in the reserves table in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels

exxonmobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions blocks and leases the terms and conditions under which the corporation maintains exploration andor production rights to the acreage are propertyspecific contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration in some instances the corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension in cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage the corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions

united states 

  

oil and gas leases have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years and a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases under certain circumstances a lease may be held beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced in some instances a “fee interest” is acquired where both the surface and the underlying mineral interests are owned outright 

  

canada  south america 

  

canada 

  

exploration permits are granted for varying periods of time with renewals possible exploration rights in onshore areas acquired from canadian provinces entitle the holder to obtain leases upon completing specified work production leases are held as long as there is production on the lease the majority of cold lake leases were taken for an initial 21year term in 19681969 and renewed for a second 21year term in 19891990 the exploration acreage in eastern canada and the block in the beaufort sea acquired in 2007 are currently held by work commitments of various amounts

under the mining law effective january 1 2003 exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license the term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued license conditions are stipulated in the mining law 

  

production rights granted prior to january 1 2003 remain subject to their existing terms and differ slightly for onshore and offshore areas onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license ranging from 35 to 45 years offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license ranging from 15 to 40 years

exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts pscs with the national oil company the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc nnpc holds the underlying oil prospecting license opl and any resulting oil mining lease oml the terms of the pscs are generally 30 years including a tenyear exploration period an initial exploration phase plus one or two optional periods covered by an opl upon commercial discovery an opl may be converted to an oml partial relinquishment is required under the psc at the end of the tenyear exploration period and omls have a 20year production period that may be extended 

  

some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an opl opls in deepwater offshore areas are valid for ten years and are nonrenewable while in all other areas the licenses are for five years and also are nonrenewable demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an opl to an oml 

  

omls granted prior to the 1969 petroleum act ie under the mineral oils act 1914 repealed by the 1969 petroleum act were for 30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and are renewable upon 12 months’ written notice for further periods of 30 and 40 years respectively operations under these pre1969 omls are conducted under a joint venture agreement with nnpc rather than a psc in 2000 a memorandum of understanding mou was executed defining commercial terms applicable to existing joint venture oil production the mou may be terminated on one calendar year’s notice 

  

omls granted under the 1969 petroleum act which include all deepwater omls have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction for onshore or offshore location and are renewable upon 12 months’ written notice for another period of 20 years omls not held by nnpc are also subject to a mandatory 50percent relinquishment after the first ten years of their duration

syncrude operations 

  

syncrude is a jointventure established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen and to produce a highquality light 32 degree api sweet synthetic crude oil the syncrude operation located near fort mcmurray alberta canada mines a portion of the athabasca oil sands deposit the location is readily accessible by public road the produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the syncrude site to edmonton alberta by alberta oil sands pipeline ltd since startup in 1978 syncrude has produced about 19 billion barrels of synthetic crude oil imperial oil limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the jointventure exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited 

  

operating license and leases 

  

syncrude has an operating license issued by the province of alberta which is effective until 2035 this license permits syncrude to mine oil sands and produce synthetic crude oil from approved development areas on oil sands leases syncrude holds eight oil sands leases covering approximately 250000 acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit which were issued by the province of alberta the leases are automatically renewable as long as oil sands operations are ongoing or the leases are part of an approved development plan syncrude leases 10 12 17 22 and 34 containing proven reserves and leases 29 30 and 31 containing no proven reserves are included within a development plan approved by the province of alberta there were no known previous commercial operations on these leases prior to the startup of operations in 1978 

  

operations plant and equipment 

  

operations at syncrude involve three main processes open pit mining extraction of crude bitumen and upgrading of crude bitumen into synthetic crude oil the base mine located on lease 17 was depleted and ceased production in 2007 in the north mine leases 17 and 22 and in the aurora mine leases 10 12 and 34 truck shovel and hydrotransport systems are used production from the aurora mine commenced in 2000 the extraction facilities which separate crude bitumen from sand are capable of processing approximately 830000 tons of oil sands per day producing 150 million barrels of crude bitumen per year this represents recovery capability of about 93 percent of the crude bitumen contained in the mined oil sands 

  

crude bitumen extracted from oil sands is refined to a marketable hydrocarbon product through a combination of carbon removal in three large hightemperature fluidcoking vessels and by hydrogen 

  

index to financial statements addition in hightemperature highpressure hydrocracking vessels these processes remove carbon and sulfur and reformulate the crude into a low viscosity low sulfur highquality synthetic crude oil product in 2008 this upgrading process yielded 0859 barrels of synthetic crude oil per barrel of crude bitumen in 2008 about 39 percent of the synthetic crude oil was processed by edmonton area refineries and the remaining 61 percent was pipelined to refineries in eastern canada and exported primarily to the united states electricity is provided to syncrude by a 270 megawatt electricity generating plant and a 160 megawatt electricity generating plant both located at syncrude the generating plants are owned by the syncrude participants recycled water is the primary water source and incremental raw water is drawn under license from the athabasca river imperial oil limited’s 25 percent share of net investment in plant property and equipment including surface mining facilities transportation equipment and upgrading facilities was about 28 billion at yearend 2008 

  

synthetic crude oil reserves 

  

the crude bitumen is contained within the unconsolidated sands of the mcmurray formation ore bodies are buried beneath 50 to 150 feet of overburden have bitumen grades ranging from 4 to 14 weight percent and ore thickness of 115 to 180 feet estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of inplace crude bitumen volume the mining plan extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits the inplace volume depth and grade are established through extensive and closely spaced core drilling in active mining areas the approximate well spacing is 400 feet 150 wells per section and in future mining areas the well spacing is approximately 1150 feet 20 wells per section proven reserves are within the operating north and aurora mines in accordance with the approved mining plan there are extractable oil sands in the north and aurora mines with average bitumen grades of 106 and 112 weight percent respectively after deducting royalties payable to the province of alberta imperial oil limited estimates that its 25 percent net share of proven reserves at yearend 2008 was equivalent to 734 million barrels of synthetic crude oil imperial’s reserve assessment uses a 6 percent and 7 percent bitumen grade cutoff for the north mine and aurora mine respectively a 90 percent overall extraction recovery a 97 percent mining dilution factor and an 88 percent upgrading yield 

  

in 2001 the syncrude owners endorsed a further development of the syncrude resource in the area and expansion of the upgrading facilities the syncrude aurora 2 and upgrader expansion 1 project added a remote mining train and expanded the central processing and upgrading plant this increased upgrading capacity came on stream in 2006 and increased production capacity to 355 thousand barrels of synthetic crude oil per day gross additional mining trains in the north mine and aurora mine were also completed in 2005 there are no approved plans for major future expansion projects 

  

on may 1 2007 the company implemented a management services agreement under which syncrude will be provided with operational technical and business management services from imperial oil limited and exxon mobil corporation the agreement has an initial term of 10 years and may be terminated with at least two years prior written notice 

  

in november 2008 imperial oil limited along with the other syncrude jointventure owners signed an agreement with the government of alberta to amend the existing syncrude crown agreement under the amended agreement beginning january 1 2010 syncrude will begin transitioning to the new oil sands royalty regime by paying additional royalties the exact amount of which will depend on production levels from 2010 to 2015 also beginning january 1 2009 syncrude’s royalty will be based on bitumen value with upgrading costs and revenues excluded from the calculation

kearl project 

  

kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen the kearl project is located approximately 40 miles north of fort mcmurray alberta the location is currently accessible by an existing road imperial oil limited holds a 7096 percent participating interest in the joint venture and exxonmobil canada properties holds the other 2904 percent exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited and a 100 percent interest in exxonmobil canada properties 

  

kearl will be developed in three phases bitumen will be extracted from oil sands produced from openpit mining operations and processed through a bitumen extraction and froth treatment plant the product a heavy oil blend of bitumen and diluent will be shipped via pipelines for distribution to north american markets diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation to market by pipeline 

  

operating license and leases 

  

the kearl project received approvals from the province of alberta in 2007 and the government of canada in 2008 the province of alberta issued an operating and construction license in 2008 which permits the project to mine oil sands and produce bitumen from approved development areas on oil sands leases kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 48000 acres in the athabasca oil 

  

index to financial statements sands deposit the leases which are issued by the province of alberta are automatically renewable as long as the oil sands operations are ongoing or the leases are part of an approved development plan the leases involved in the first phase of the project are 6 87 and 88a which contain proven reserves and 31a 36 and 88b which do not currently contain proven reserves there were no known previous commercial operations on these leases 

  

operations plant and equipment 

  

production from the first phase is expected to average approximately 110000 barrels of bitumen a day before royalties about 500 million has been spent on the first phase activities in 2008 focused on engineering work to define the project design and execution plan other activities in 2008 also included site access road construction site preparation and earthworks significant progress has also been made on transportation system agreements 

  

kearl will be subject to the alberta generic oil sands royalty regime which was modified in 2007 and which will take effect in 2009 royalty rates will be based upon a sliding scale determined by the price of crude oil 

  

operations at kearl will involve three main processes openpit mining extraction of crude bitumen and diluent blending the openpit mining will utilize truck shovel and hydrotransport systems the extraction separates crude bitumen from sand through a froth processing plant electricity will be provided initially through the alberta grid recycled water will be the primary water source and incremental raw water will be drawn under license from the athabasca river 

  

proven reserves 

  

bitumen deposits at kearl are found throughout sandstones within the lower middle and upper mcmurray members concentrated primarily within the middle and upper mcmurray members the oil sands occur over depths ranging from approximately 30 feet to as much as 450 feet below surface the oil sands are about 130 feet in net thickness but can be as thick as 230 feet mined bitumen reserve estimates are based upon detailed geological and engineering assessments of inplace crude bitumen volumes the mining plan demonstrated extraction recovery factors planned operating capacity and operating approval limits the inplace volume depth and grade of the first phase were established through extensive and closely spaced core drilling with spacing of approximately 1400 feet 14 wells per section the determination of reserves uses a seven percent bitumen grade cutoff by weight a 77 percent overall extraction recovery paraffinic froth treatment process and a 95 percent mining dilution factor

 item 1a risk factors  tableend   

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a number of factors many of which are not within the company’s control these factors include the following 

  

industry and economic factors the oil and gas business is fundamentally a commodity business this means the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on gasoline and other refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity these events or conditions are generally not predictable and include among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

under certain market conditions factors that have a positive impact on one segment of our business may have a negative impact on another segment and vice versa 

  

competitive factors the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes 

  

a key component of the corporation’s competitive position particularly given the commoditybased nature of many of its businesses is exxonmobil’s ability to manage expenses successfully this requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency including through technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements and regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio as described elsewhere in this report 

  

political and legal factors the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to time in varying degree by political and legal factors including 

  

   

index to financial statements    

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

both the likelihood of these occurrences and their overall effect upon the corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable a key component of the corporation’s strategy for managing political risk is geographic diversification of the corporation’s assets and operations 

  

project factors in addition to some of the factors cited above exxonmobil’s results depend upon the corporation’s ability to develop and operate major projects and facilities as planned the corporation’s results will therefore be affected by events or conditions that impact the advancement operation cost or results of such projects or facilities including

part of the information in response to this item and to the securities exchange act industry guide 2 is contained in “note 8 property plant and equipment and asset retirement obligations” and in the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” both included in the financial section of this report 

  

information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows 

  

   

estimated proved reserves are shown in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2007 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date for information on the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves see the “standardized measure of discounted future cash flows” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report 

  

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area for consolidated subsidiaries as detailed in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report for the year ended december 31 2007 the corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of december 31 prices and costs gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels 

  

   

index to financial statements additional detail on developed and undeveloped oilequivalent proved reserves is shown in the table below 

  

   

in the preceding reserves information and in the reserves tables in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

  

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity to grow over the period 20082012 however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in item 1a—risk factors of this report 

  

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and gas price levels 

  

2 estimates of total net proved oil and gas reserves filed with other federal agencies 

  

during 2007 exxonmobil filed proved reserves estimates with the us department of energy on forms eia23 and eia28 the information on form eia28 is presented on the same basis as the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2006 which shows exxonmobil’s net interests in all liquids and gas reserve volumes and changes thereto from both exxonmobiloperated properties and properties operated by others the data on form eia23 although consistent with the data on form eia28 is presented on a different basis and includes 100 percent of the oil and gas volumes from exxonmobiloperated properties only regardless of the company’s net interest in addition 

  

index to financial statements form eia23 information does not include gas plant liquids the difference between the oil reserves and gas reserves reported on eia23 and those reported in the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2006 exceeds five percent 

  

3 average sales prices and production costs per unit of production 

  

reference is made to the “results of operations” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the corporation’s own production as the divisor average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids ngl production used for this computation are shown in the reserves table in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report the volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and thus are different from those shown in the reserves table in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared the volumes of natural gas were converted to oilequivalent barrels based on a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel 

  

4 gross and net productive wells 

  

   

the numbers of wells operated at yearend 2007 were 16797 gross wells and 13945 net wells at yearend 2006 the numbers of operated wells were 16914 gross wells and 13988 net wells 

  

5 gross and net developed acreage 

  

   

note separate acreage data for oil and gas are not maintained because in many instances both are produced from the same acreage 

  

index to financial statements 6 gross and net undeveloped acreage 

  

   

exxonmobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions blocks and leases the terms and conditions under which the corporation maintains exploration andor production rights to the acreage are propertyspecific contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration in some instances the corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension in cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage the corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions 

  

7 summary of acreage terms in key areas

venezuela 

  

until the recent venezuelan government actions described below exploration and production activities were governed by association agreements containing riskprofit provisions negotiated with the national oil company or its affiliates association agreements were awarded for a term not to 

  

index to financial statements exceed 39 years these agreements had an exploration and a production phase the term of production began after the exploration phase for a duration of 20 years with the possibility of an extension so long as the total contract term did not exceed 39 years 

  

strategic association agreements such as the cerro negro project were typically limited to those projects that required vertical integration for extra heavy crude oil contracts were awarded for 35 years significant amendments to the contract terms required venezuelan congressional approval 

  

on february 26 2007 president chavez issued law decree n° 5200 which mandated the conversion of the orinoco belt association agreements cerro negro and oil profit sharing agreements la ceiba into mixed enterprises the “nationalization decree” the nationalization decree further ordered the transfer of operations to pdvsa petroleos s a pdvsa by april 30 2007 the exxonmobil affiliates in venezuela were unable to reach agreement to migrate to a mixed enterprise by june 26 2007 as required by the nationalization decree assets were expropriated on june 27 2007 on september 6 2007 the exxonmobil affiliates filed a request for arbitration with the international centre for settlement of investment disputes against venezuela exxonmobil also has filed an arbitration under the rules of the international chamber of commerce against pdvsa and a pdvsa affiliate for breach of their contractual obligations under certain cerro negro project agreements

information with regard to mining activities follows  

  

syncrude operations 

  

syncrude is a jointventure established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen and to produce a highquality light 32 degree api sweet synthetic crude oil the syncrude operation located near fort mcmurray alberta canada mines a portion of the athabasca oil sands deposit the location is readily accessible by public road the produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the syncrude site to edmonton alberta by alberta oil sands pipeline ltd since startup in 1978 syncrude has produced about 18 billion barrels of synthetic crude oil imperial oil limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the jointventure exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited 

  

operating license and leases 

  

syncrude has an operating license issued by the province of alberta which is effective until 2035 this license permits syncrude to mine oil sands and produce synthetic crude oil from approved development areas on oil sands leases syncrude holds eight oil sands leases covering approximately 248300 acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit which were issued by the province of alberta the leases are automatically renewable as long as oil sands operations are ongoing or the leases are part of an approved development plan syncrude leases 10 12 17 22 and 34 containing proven reserves and leases 29 30 and 31 containing no proven reserves are included within a development plan approved by the province of alberta there were no known previous commercial operations on these leases prior to the startup of operations in 1978 

  

operations plant and equipment 

  

operations at syncrude involve three main processes open pit mining extraction of crude bitumen and upgrading of crude bitumen into synthetic crude oil the base mine located on lease 17 was depleted and ceased production in 2007 in the north mine leases 17 and 22 and in the aurora mine leases 10 12 and 34 truck shovel and hydrotransport systems are used production from the aurora mine commenced in 2000 the extraction facilities which separate crude bitumen from sand are capable of processing approximately 830000 tons of oil sands a day producing 150 million barrels of crude bitumen a year this represents recovery capability of about 93 percent of the crude bitumen contained in the mined oil sands 

  

index to financial statements crude bitumen extracted from oil sands is refined to a marketable hydrocarbon product through a combination of carbon removal in three large hightemperature fluidcoking vessels and by hydrogen addition in hightemperature highpressure hydrocracking vessels these processes remove carbon and sulfur and reformulate the crude into a low viscosity low sulfur highquality synthetic crude oil product in 2007 this upgrading process yielded 0843 barrels of synthetic crude oil per barrel of crude bitumen in 2007 about 38 percent of the synthetic crude oil was processed by edmonton area refineries and the remaining 62 percent was pipelined to refineries in eastern canada and exported primarily to the united states electricity is provided to syncrude by a 270 megawatt electricity generating plant and a 160 megawatt electricity generating plant both located at syncrude the generating plants are owned by the syncrude participants recycled water is the primary water source and incremental raw water is drawn under license from the athabasca river imperial oil limited’s 25 percent share of net investment in plant property and equipment including surface mining facilities transportation equipment and upgrading facilities was about 34 billion at yearend 2007 

  

synthetic crude oil reserves 

  

the crude bitumen is contained within the unconsolidated sands of the mcmurray formation ore bodies are buried beneath 50 to 150 feet of overburden have bitumen grades ranging from 4 to 14 weight percent and ore thickness of 115 to 160 feet estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of inplace crude bitumen volume the mining plan extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits the inplace volume depth and grade are established through extensive and closely spaced core drilling in active mining areas the approximate well spacing is 400 feet 150 wells per section and in future mining areas the well spacing is approximately 1150 feet 20 wells per section proven reserves are within the operating north and aurora mines in accordance with the approved mining plan there are extractable oil sands in the north and aurora mines with average bitumen grades of 106 and 112 weight percent respectively after deducting royalties payable to the province of alberta imperial oil limited estimates that its 25 percent net share of proven reserves at yearend 2007 was equivalent to 694 million barrels of synthetic crude oil imperial’s reserve assessment uses a 6 percent and 7 percent bitumen grade cutoff for the north mine and aurora mine respectively a 90 percent overall extraction recovery a 97 percent mining dilution factor and an 88 percent upgrading yield 

  

in 2001 the syncrude owners endorsed a further development of the syncrude resource in the area and expansion of the upgrading facilities the syncrude aurora 2 and upgrader expansion 1 project added a remote mining train and expanded the central processing and upgrading plant this increased upgrading capacity came on stream in 2006 and increased production capacity to 355 thousand barrels of synthetic crude oil per day gross additional mining trains in the north mine and aurora mine were also completed in 2005 there are no approved plans for major future expansion projects 

  

in 2007 the alberta government proposed changes to the generic oil sands royalty regime beginning in 2009 the syncrude joint venture owners have a crown agreement with the province of alberta that codifies the royalty rates through december 31 2015 the syncrude joint venture owners are in discussions with the alberta government to determine if an amended agreement can be negotiated that would transition syncrude to the new generic royalty regime before 2016

 item 1a risk factors  tableend   

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a number of factors many of which are not within the company’s control these factors include the following 

  

industry and economic factors the oil and gas business is fundamentally a commodity business this means the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on gasoline and other refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity these events or conditions are generally not predictable and include among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

under certain market conditions factors that have a positive impact on one segment of our business may have a negative impact on another segment and vice versa 

  

competitive factors the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes 

  

a key component of the corporation’s competitive position particularly given the commoditybased nature of many of its businesses is exxonmobil’s ability to manage expenses successfully this requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency including through technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements and regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio as described elsewhere in this report 

  

political and legal factors the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to time in varying degree by political and legal factors including 

  

   

index to financial statements    

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

both the likelihood of these occurrences and their overall effect upon the corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable a key component of the corporation’s strategy for managing political risk is geographic diversification of the corporation’s assets and operations 

  

project factors in addition to some of the factors cited above exxonmobil’s results depend upon the corporation’s ability to develop and operate major projects and facilities as planned the corporation’s results will therefore be affected by events or conditions that impact the advancement operation cost or results of such projects or facilities including

 item 2 properties 

  

part of the information in response to this item and to the securities exchange act industry guide 2 is contained in “note 8 property plant and equipment and asset retirement obligations” and in the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” both included in the financial section of this report 

  

information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows 

  

   

estimated proved reserves are shown in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2006 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date for information on the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves see the “standardized measure of discounted future cash flows” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report 

  

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area for consolidated subsidiaries as detailed in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report for the year ended december 31 2006 the corporation has reported 2005 and 2006 proved reserves on the basis of december 31 prices and costs gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels 

  

   

index to financial statements additional detail on developed and undeveloped oilequivalent proved reserves is shown in the table below 

  

   

in the preceding reserves information and in the reserves tables in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

  

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity to grow over the period 20072011 however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes asset sales weather events price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in item 1a—risk factors of this report 

  

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of longterm oil and gas price levels 

  

2 estimates of total net proved oil and gas reserves filed with other federal agencies 

  

during 2006 exxonmobil filed proved reserves estimates with the us department of energy on forms eia23 and eia28 the information on form eia28 is presented on the same basis as the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2005 which shows exxonmobil’s net interests in all liquids and gas reserve volumes and changes thereto from both exxonmobiloperated properties and properties operated by others the data on form eia23 although consistent with the data on form eia28 is presented on a different basis and includes 100 percent of the oil and gas volumes from exxonmobiloperated properties only regardless of the company’s net interest in addition 

  

index to financial statements form eia23 information does not include gas plant liquids the difference between the oil reserves and gas reserves reported on eia23 and those reported in the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2005 exceeds five percent 

  

3 average sales prices and production costs per unit of production 

  

reference is made to the “results of operations” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the corporation’s own production as the divisor average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids ngl production used for this computation are shown in the reserves table in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report the volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and thus are different from those shown in the reserves table in the “oil and gas reserves” part of the “supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” portion of the financial section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared the volumes of natural gas were converted to oilequivalent barrels based on a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel 

  

4 gross and net productive wells 

  

   

the numbers of wells operated at yearend 2006 were 16914 gross wells and 13988 net wells at yearend 2005 the numbers of operated wells were 17351 gross wells and 14028 net wells 

  

5 gross and net developed acreage 

  

   

note separate acreage data for oil and gas are not maintained because in many instances both are produced from the same acreage 

  

index to financial statements 6 gross and net undeveloped acreage 

  

   

exxonmobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions blocks and leases the terms and conditions under which the corporation maintains exploration andor production rights to the acreage are propertyspecific contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration in some instances the corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension in cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage the corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions

information with regard to mining activities follows  

  

syncrude operations 

  

syncrude is a jointventure established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen and to produce a highquality light 32 degree api sweet synthetic crude oil the syncrude operation located near fort mcmurray alberta canada exploits a portion of the athabasca oil sands deposit the location is readily accessible by public road the produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the syncrude site to edmonton alberta by alberta oil sands pipeline ltd since startup in 1978 syncrude has produced about 17 billion barrels of synthetic crude oil imperial oil limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the jointventure exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited 

  

operating license and leases 

  

syncrude has an operating license issued by the province of alberta which is effective until 2035 this license permits syncrude to mine oil sands and produce synthetic crude oil from approved development areas on oil sands leases syncrude holds eight oil sands leases covering approximately 248300 acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit which were issued by the province of alberta the leases are automatically renewable as long as oil sands operations are ongoing or the leases are part of an approved development plan syncrude leases 10 12 17 22 and 34 containing proven reserves and leases 29 30 and 31 containing no proven reserves are included within a development plan approved by the province of alberta there were no known previous commercial operations on these leases prior to the startup of operations in 1978 

  

operations plant and equipment 

  

operations at syncrude involve three main processes open pit mining extraction of crude bitumen and upgrading of crude bitumen into synthetic crude oil the base mine lease 17 has now 

  

index to financial statements been mined out and only remnants are now being removed using trucks and shovels in the north mine leases 17 and 22 and in the aurora mine leases 10 12 and 34 truck shovel and hydrotransport systems are used production from the aurora mine commenced in 2000 the extraction facilities which separate crude bitumen from sand are capable of processing approximately 740000 tons of oil sands a day producing 150 million barrels of crude bitumen a year this represents recovery capability of about 93 percent of the crude bitumen contained in the mined oil sands 

  

crude bitumen extracted from oil sands is refined to a marketable hydrocarbon product through a combination of carbon removal in three large hightemperature fluidcoking vessels and by hydrogen addition in hightemperature highpressure hydrocracking vessels these processes remove carbon and sulfur and reformulate the crude into a low viscosity low sulfur highquality synthetic crude oil product in 2006 this upgrading process yielded 0849 barrels of synthetic crude oil per barrel of crude bitumen in 2006 about 44 percent of the synthetic crude oil was processed by edmonton area refineries and the remaining 56 percent was pipelined to refineries in eastern canada and exported primarily to the united states electricity is provided to syncrude by a 270 megawatt electricity generating plant and a 160 megawatt electricity generating plant both located at syncrude the generating plants are owned by the syncrude participants recycled water is the primary water source and incremental raw water is drawn under license from the athabasca river imperial oil limited’s 25 percent share of net investment in plant property and equipment including surface mining facilities transportation equipment and upgrading facilities was about 29 billion at yearend 2006 

  

synthetic crude oil reserves 

  

the crude bitumen is contained within the unconsolidated sands of the mcmurray formation ore bodies are buried beneath 50 to 150 feet of overburden have bitumen grades ranging from 4 to 14 weight percent and ore thickness of 115 to 160 feet estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of inplace crude bitumen volume the mining plan extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits the inplace volume depth and grade are established through extensive and closely spaced core drilling in active mining areas the approximate well spacing is 400 feet 150 wells per section and in future mining areas the well spacing is approximately 1150 feet 20 wells per section proven reserves include the operating base and north mines and the aurora mine in accordance with the approved mining plan there are an estimated 1845 million tons of extractable oil sands in the base and north mines with an average bitumen grade of 106 weight percent in addition at the aurora mine there are an estimated 4580 million tons of extractable oil sands at an average bitumen grade of 112 weight percent after deducting royalties payable to the province of alberta imperial oil limited estimates that its 25 percent net share of proven reserves at yearend 2006 was equivalent to 718 million barrels of synthetic crude oil imperial’s reserve assessment uses a 6 percent and 7 percent bitumen grade cutoff for the north mine and aurora mine respectively a 90 percent overall extraction recovery a 97 percent mining dilution factor and an 88 percent upgrading yield 

  

in 2001 the syncrude owners endorsed a further development of the syncrude resource in the area and expansion of the upgrading facilities the syncrude aurora 2 and upgrader expansion 1 project adds a remote mining train and expands the central processing and upgrading plant this increased upgrading capacity came on stream in 2006 and increased production capacity to 355 thousand barrels of synthetic crude oil per day gross additional mining trains in the north mine and aurora mine were also completed in 2005 there are no approved plans for major future expansion projects

 item 1a risk factors  tableend   

exxonmobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a number of factors many of which are not within the company’s control these factors include the following 

  

industry and economic factors the oil and gas business is fundamentally a commodity business this means the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world may be significantly affected by changes in oil gas and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on gasoline and other refined products oil gas petrochemical and product prices and margins in turn depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity these events or conditions are generally not predictable and include among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

under certain market conditions factors that have a positive impact on one segment of our business may have a negative impact on another segment and vice versa 

  

competitive factors the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes 

  

a key component of the corporation’s competitive position particularly given the commoditybased nature of many of its businesses is exxonmobil’s ability to manage expenses successfully this requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency including through technology improvements cost control productivity enhancements and regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio as described elsewhere in this report 

  

political factors the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to time in varying degree by political factors including 

  

   

   

   

index to financial statements    

   

   

   

   

   

both the likelihood of these occurrences and their overall effect upon the corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable a key component of the corporation’s strategy for managing political risk is geographic diversification of the corporation’s assets and operations 

  

project factors in addition to some of the factors cited above exxonmobil’s results depend upon the corporation’s ability to develop and operate major projects and facilities as planned the corporation’s results will therefore be affected by events or conditions that impact the advancement operation cost or results of such projects or facilities including

information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows 

  

   

estimated proved reserves are shown on pages 80 through 83 of the financial section of this report no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2005 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date for information on the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves see pages 84 and 85 of the financial section of this report 

  

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area for consolidated subsidiaries as detailed on pages 80 through 83 of the financial section of this report for the year ended december 31 2005 the corporation has reported 2004 and 2005 proved reserves on the basis of december 31 prices and costs gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels 

  

   

additional detail on developed and undeveloped oilequivalent proved reserves is shown in the table below 

  

   

index to financial statements in the preceding reserves information and in the reserves tables on pages 80 through 83 of the financial section of this report consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same views of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

  

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity to grow over the period 20062010 however actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes asset sales severe weather events price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in item 1a—risk factors of this report 

  

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and ultimate recovery can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of long term oil and gas price levels 

  

2 estimates of total net proved oil and gas reserves filed with other federal agencies 

  

during 2005 exxonmobil filed proved reserves estimates with the us department of energy on forms eia23 and eia28 the information on form eia28 is presented on the same basis as the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2004 which shows exxonmobil’s net interests in all liquids and gas reserve volumes and changes thereto from both exxonmobiloperated properties and properties operated by others the data on form eia23 although consistent with the data on form eia28 is presented on a different basis and includes 100 percent of the oil and gas volumes from exxonmobiloperated properties only regardless of the company’s net interest in addition form eia23 information does not include gas plant liquids the difference between the oil reserves and gas reserves reported on eia23 and those reported in the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2004 exceeds five percent 

  

3 average sales prices and production costs per unit of production 

  

reference is made to pages 76 and 77 of the financial section of this report average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the corporation’s own production as the divisor average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids ngl production used for this computation are shown in the reserves table on page 81 of the financial section of this report the volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and thus are different from those shown in the reserves table on page 82 of the financial section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared the volumes of natural gas were converted to oilequivalent barrels based on a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel 

  

index to financial statements 4 gross and net productive wells 

  

   

the numbers of wells operated at yearend 2005 were 17351 gross wells and 14028 net wells at yearend 2004 the numbers of operated wells were 18427 gross wells and 15216 net wells 

  

5 gross and net developed acreage 

  

   

note separate acreage data for oil and gas are not maintained because in many instances both are produced from the same acreage 

  

6 gross and net undeveloped acreage 

  

   

exxonmobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions blocks and leases the terms and conditions under which the corporation maintains exploration andor production rights to the acreage are propertyspecific contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration in some instances the corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension in cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage the corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions 

  

index to financial statements 7 summary of acreage terms in key areas 

  

united states 

  

oil and gas leases have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years and a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases in some instances a “fee interest” is acquired where both the surface and the underlying mineral interests are owned outright 

  

canada 

  

exploration permits are granted for varying periods of time with renewals possible production leases are held as long as there is production on the lease the majority of cold lake leases were taken for an initial 21year term in 19681969 and renewed for a second 21year term in 19891990 the exploration acreage in eastern canada is currently held by work commitments of various amounts 

  

europe 

  

france 

  

exploration permits are granted for periods of three to five years and are renewable up to two times accompanied by substantial acreage relinquishments 50 percent of the acreage at first renewal 25 percent of the remaining acreage at second renewal a 1994 law requires a bidding process prior to granting of an exploration permit upon discovery of commercial hydrocarbons a production concession is granted for up to 50 years renewable in periods of 25 years each 

  

germany 

  

exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years with possible extensions of up to three years for an indefinite period extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions as long as there is production on the license

information with regard to mining activities follows  

  

syncrude operations 

  

syncrude is a jointventure established to recover shallow deposits of tar sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen and to produce a highquality light 32 degree api sweet synthetic crude oil the syncrude operation located near fort mcmurray alberta canada exploits a portion of the athabasca oil sands deposit the location is readily accessible by public road the produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the syncrude site to edmonton alberta by alberta oil sands pipeline ltd since startup in 1978 syncrude has produced about 16 billion barrels of synthetic crude oil imperial oil limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the jointventure exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited 

  

operating license and leases 

  

syncrude has an operating license issued by the province of alberta which is effective until 2035 this license permits syncrude to mine tar sands and produce synthetic crude oil from approved development areas on tar sands leases syncrude holds eight tar sands leases covering approximately 252000 acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit which were issued by the province of alberta the leases are automatically renewable as long as tar sands operations are ongoing or the leases are part of an approved development plan syncrude leases 10 12 17 22 and 34 containing proven reserves and leases 29 30 and 31 containing no proven reserves are included within a development plan approved by the province of alberta there were no known previous commercial operations on these leases prior to the startup of operations in 1978 

  

operations plant and equipment 

  

operations at syncrude involve three main processes open pit mining extraction of crude bitumen and upgrading of crude bitumen into synthetic crude oil in the base mine lease 17 the mining and transportation system uses draglines bucketwheel reclaimers and belt conveyors in the 

  

index to financial statements north mine leases 17 and 22 and in the aurora mine leases 10 12 and 34 truck shovel and hydrotransport systems are used production from the aurora mine commenced in 2000 the extraction facilities which separate crude bitumen from sand are capable of processing approximately 545000 tons of tar sands a day producing 110 million barrels of crude bitumen a year this represents recovery capability of about 92 percent of the crude bitumen contained in the mined tar sands 

  

crude bitumen extracted from tar sands is refined to a marketable hydrocarbon product through a combination of carbon removal in two large hightemperature fluidcoking vessels and by hydrogen addition in hightemperature highpressure hydrocracking vessels these processes remove carbon and sulfur and reformulate the crude into a low viscosity low sulfur highquality synthetic crude oil product in 2005 this upgrading process yielded 0853 barrels of synthetic crude oil per barrel of crude bitumen in 2005 about 49 percent of the synthetic crude oil was processed by edmonton area refineries and the remaining 51 percent was pipelined to refineries in eastern canada and exported primarily to the united states electricity is provided to syncrude by a 270 megawatt electricity generating plant and an 80 megawatt electricity generating plant both located at syncrude the generating plants are owned by the syncrude participants imperial oil limited’s 25 percent share of net investment in plant property and equipment including surface mining facilities transportation equipment and upgrading facilities was about 28 billion at year end 2005 

  

synthetic crude oil reserves 

  

the crude bitumen is contained within the unconsolidated sands of the mcmurray formation ore bodies are buried beneath 50 to 150 feet of overburden have bitumen grades ranging from 4 to 14 weight percent and ore thickness of 115 to 160 feet estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of inplace crude bitumen volume the mining plan historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits the inplace volume depth and grade are established through extensive and closely spaced core drilling proven reserves include the operating base and north mines and the aurora mine in accordance with the approved mining plan there are an estimated 1890 million tons of extractable tar sands in the base and north mines with an average bitumen grade of 106 weight percent in addition at the aurora mine there are an estimated 4485 million tons of extractable tar sands at an average bitumen grade of 112 weight percent after deducting royalties payable to the province of alberta imperial oil limited estimates that its 25 percent net share of proven reserves at year end 2005 was equivalent to 738 million barrels of synthetic crude oil 

  

in 2001 the syncrude owners endorsed a further development of the syncrude resource in the area and expansion of the upgrading facilities the syncrude aurora 2 and upgrader expansion 1 project adds a remote mining train and expands the central processing and upgrading plant the aurora 2 mining and extraction development became fully operational in 2004 the upgrader expansion will be completed in 2006 when completed this project will increase production capacity to 350 thousand barrels of synthetic crude oil per day gross

index to financial statements factors affecting future results 

  

competitive factors the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of various goods or services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes a key component of the corporation’s competitive position particularly given the commoditybased nature of many of its products is its ability to manage expenses successfully which requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency 

  

political factors the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to time in varying degree by political instability and by other political developments and laws and regulations such as forced divestiture of assets restrictions on production imports and exports war or other international conflicts civil unrest and local security concerns that threaten the safe operation of company facilities price controls tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 

  

industry and economic factors the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world are affected by local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil natural gas petroleum products petrochemicals and other exxonmobil products these events or conditions are generally not predictable and include among other things general economic growth rates and the occurrence of economic recessions the development of new supply sources adherence by countries to opec quotas supply disruptions weather including seasonal patterns that affect energy demand and severe weather events that can disrupt operations technological advances including advances in exploration production refining and petrochemical manufacturing technology and advances in technology relating to energy usage changes in demographics including population growth rates and consumer preferences and the competitiveness of alternative hydrocarbon or other energy sources or product substitutes 

  

project factors in addition to the factors cited above the advancement cost and results of particular exxonmobil projects depend on the outcome of negotiations with partners governments suppliers customers or others changes in operating conditions or costs changes in rates of field decline and the occurrence of unforeseen technical difficulties see section 1 of item 2 of this report for discussion of additional factors affecting future capacity growth and the timing and ultimate recovery of reserves 

  

market risk factors see pages 39 and 40 of the financial section of this report for discussion of the impact of market risks inflation and other uncertainties 

  

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report

 item 2 properties 

  

part of the information in response to this item and to the securities exchange act industry guide 2 is contained in the financial section of this report in note 9 which note appears on page 59 and on pages 78 through 87 

  

information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows 

  

   

estimated proved reserves are shown on pages 82 through 85 of the financial section of this report no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2004 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date with the exception of bitumen prices in western canada which have increased substantially from december 31 this price increase resulted in the rebooking in 2005 of approximately 05 billion oilequivalent barrels at the cold lake field for information on the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves see pages 86 and 87 of the financial section of this report 

  

the table below summarizes the oilequivalent proved reserves in each geographic area for consolidated subsidiaries as detailed on pages 82 through 85 of the financial section of this report for the year ended december 31 2004 the corporation has reported 2004 proved reserves on the basis of december 31 2004 prices and costs for the first time gas is converted to an oilequivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels 

  

   

additional detail on developed and undeveloped oilequivalent proved reserves is shown in the table below 

  

   

index to financial statements in the preceding reserves information and in the reserves tables on pages 82 through 85 of the financial section of this report consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately however the corporation operates its business with the same views of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries 

  

the corporation’s overall volume capacity outlook based on projects coming on stream as anticipated is for production capacity increases to average 3 percent annually through 2010 however actual volume increases will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project startups operational outages reservoir performance regulatory changes price effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described under the heading “factors affecting future results” in item 1 of this report 

  

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines in certain deepwater fields proved reserves are recorded in a limited number of cases before flow tests are conducted because of the safety and cost implications of conducting the tests in those situations other industry accepted analyses are used such as information from well logs a thorough pressure and fluid sampling program conventional core data obtained across the entire reservoir interval and nearby analog data historically proved reserves recorded using these methods have been immaterial when compared to the corporation’s total proved reserves and have also been validated by subsequent flow tests or actual production levels furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and ultimate recovery can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of long term oil and gas price levels 

  

2 estimates of total net proved oil and gas reserves filed with other federal agencies 

  

during 2004 exxonmobil filed proved reserves estimates with the us department of energy on forms eia23 and eia28 the information on form eia28 is presented on the same basis as the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2003 which shows exxonmobil’s net interests in all liquids and gas reserve volumes and changes thereto from both exxonmobiloperated properties and properties operated by others the data on form eia23 although consistent with the data on form eia28 is presented on a different basis and includes 100 percent of the oil and gas volumes from exxonmobiloperated properties only regardless of the company’s net interest in addition form eia23 information does not include gas plant liquids the difference between the oil reserves reported on eia23 and those reported in the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2003 exceeds five percent the difference in gas reserves did not exceed five percent 

  

3 average sales prices and production costs per unit of production 

  

reference is made to pages 78 and 79 of the financial section of this report average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the corporation’s own production as the divisor average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids ngl production used for this computation are shown in the reserves table on page 83 of the financial section of this report the volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and thus are different from those shown in the reserves table on page 84 of the financial section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared the volumes of natural gas were converted to oilequivalent barrels based on a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel

note separate acreage data for oil and gas are not maintained because in many instances both are produced from the same acreage 

  

6 gross and net undeveloped acreage 

  

   

exxonmobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions blocks and leases the terms and conditions under which the corporation maintains exploration andor production rights to the acreage are propertyspecific contractuallydefined and vary significantly work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration in some instances the corporation may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension in cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage the corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions

information with regard to mining activities follows  

  

syncrude operations 

  

syncrude is a jointventure established to recover shallow deposits of tar sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen and to produce a highquality light 32 degree api sweet synthetic crude oil the syncrude operation located near fort mcmurray alberta canada exploits a portion of the athabasca oil sands deposit the location is readily accessible by public road the produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the syncrude site to edmonton alberta by alberta oil sands pipeline ltd since startup in 1978 syncrude has produced about 15 billion barrels of synthetic crude oil imperial oil limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the jointventure exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited 

  

operating license and leases 

  

syncrude has an operating license issued by the province of alberta which is effective until 2035 this license permits syncrude to mine tar sands and produce synthetic crude oil from approved development areas on tar sands leases syncrude holds eight tar sands leases covering approximately 252000 acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit which were issued by the province of alberta the leases are automatically renewable as long as tar sands operations are ongoing or the leases are part of an approved development plan syncrude leases 10 12 17 22 and 34 containing proven reserves and leases 29 30 and 31 containing no proven reserves are included within a development plan approved by the province of alberta there were no known previous commercial operations on these leases prior to the startup of operations in 1978 

  

operations plant and equipment 

  

operations at syncrude involve three main processes open pit mining extraction of crude bitumen and upgrading of crude bitumen into synthetic crude oil in the base mine lease 17 the mining and transportation system uses draglines bucketwheel reclaimers and belt conveyors in the 

  

index to financial statements north mine leases 17 and 22 and in the aurora mine leases 10 12 and 34 truck shovel and hydrotransport systems are used production from the aurora mine commenced in 2000 the extraction facilities which separates crude bitumen from sand are capable of processing approximately 545000 tons of tar sands a day producing 110 million barrels of crude bitumen a year this represents recovery capability of about 92 percent of the crude bitumen contained in the mined tar sands 

  

crude bitumen extracted from tar sands is refined to a marketable hydrocarbon product through a combination of carbon removal in two large hightemperature fluidcoking vessels and by hydrogen addition in hightemperature highpressure hydrocracking vessels these processes remove carbon and sulfur and reformulate the crude into a low viscosity low sulfur highquality synthetic crude oil product in 2004 this upgrading process yielded 0855 barrels of synthetic crude oil per barrel of crude bitumen in 2004 about 46 percent of the synthetic crude oil was processed by edmonton area refineries and the remaining 54 percent was pipelined to refineries in eastern canada and exported primarily to the united states electricity is provided to syncrude by a 270 megawatt electricity generating plant and an 80 megawatt electricity generating plant both located at syncrude the generating plants are owned by the syncrude participants imperial oil limited’s 25 percent share of net investment in plant property and equipment including surface mining facilities transportation equipment and upgrading facilities was about 23 billion at year end 2004 

  

synthetic crude oil reserves 

  

the crude bitumen is contained within the unconsolidated sands of the mcmurray formation ore bodies are buried beneath 50 to 150 feet of overburden have bitumen grades ranging from 4 to 14 weight percent and ore thickness of 115 to 160 feet estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of inplace crude bitumen volume the mining plan historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits the inplace volume depth and grade are established through extensive and closely spaced core drilling proven reserves include the operating base and north mines and the aurora mine in accordance with the approved mining plan there are an estimated 2055 million tons of extractable tar sands in the base and north mines with an average bitumen grade of 106 weight percent in addition at the aurora mine there are an estimated 4470 million tons of extractable tar sands at an average bitumen grade of 111 weight percent after deducting royalties payable to the province of alberta imperial oil limited estimates that its 25 percent net share of proven reserves at year end 2004 was equivalent to 757 million barrels of synthetic crude oil 

  

in 2001 the syncrude owners endorsed a further development of the syncrude resource in the area and expansion of the upgrading facilities the syncrude aurora 2 and upgrader expansion 1 project adds a remote mining train and expands the central processing and upgrading plant this expansion is under way and will lead to total production of about 350 thousand barrels of synthetic crude oil per day gross when completed

factors affecting future results 

  

competitive factors the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy fuel and 

  

index to financial statements chemical needs of industry and individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of various goods or services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes a key component of the corporation’s competitive position particularly given the commoditybased nature of many of its products is its ability to manage expenses successfully which requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency 

  

political factors the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to time in varying degree by political instability and by other political developments and laws and regulations such as forced divestiture of assets restrictions on production imports and exports war or other international conflicts civil unrest and local security concerns that threaten the safe operation of company facilities price controls tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 

  

industry and economic factors the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world are affected by local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil natural gas petroleum products petrochemicals and other exxonmobil products these events or conditions are generally not predictable and include among other things general economic growth rates and the occurrence of economic recessions the development of new supply sources adherence by countries to opec quotas supply disruptions weather including seasonal patterns that affect energy demand and severe weather events that can disrupt operations technological advances including advances in exploration production refining and petrochemical manufacturing technology and advances in technology relating to energy usage changes in demographics including population growth rates and consumer preferences and the competitiveness of alternative hydrocarbon or other energy sources or product substitutes 

  

project factors in addition to the factors cited above the advancement cost and results of particular exxonmobil projects depend on the outcome of negotiations with partners governments suppliers customers or others changes in operating conditions or costs changes in rates of field decline and the occurrence of unforeseen technical difficulties see section 1 of item 2 of this report for discussion of additional factors affecting the timing and ultimate recovery of reserves 

  

market risk factors see pages 37 and 38 of the financial section of this report for discussion of the impact of market risks inflation and other uncertainties

information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows 

  

   

estimated proved reserves are shown on pages 72 and 73 of the financial section of this report no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2003 that 

  

index to financial statements would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date for information on the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves see page 74 of the financial section of this report 

  

the estimation of proved reserves which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines in certain deepwater fields proved reserves are recorded in a limited number of cases before flow tests are conducted because of the safety and cost implications of conducting the tests in those situations other industry accepted analyses are used such as information from well logs a thorough pressure and fluid sampling program conventional core data obtained across the entire reservoir interval and nearby analog data historically proved reserves recorded using these methods have been immaterial when compared to the corporation’s total proved reserves and have also been validated by subsequent flow tests or actual production levels furthermore the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced the timing and ultimate recovery can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects reservoir performance regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections of long term oil and gas price levels 

  

2 estimates of total net proved oil and gas reserves filed with other federal agencies 

  

during 2003 exxonmobil filed proved reserves estimates with the us department of energy on forms eia23 and eia28 the information on form eia28 is presented on the same basis as the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2002 which shows exxonmobil’s net interests in all liquids and gas reserve volumes and changes thereto from both exxonmobiloperated properties and properties operated by others the data on form eia23 although consistent with the data on form eia28 is presented on a different basis and includes 100 percent of the oil and gas volumes from exxonmobiloperated properties only regardless of the company’s net interest in addition form eia23 information does not include gas plant liquids the difference between the oil reserves reported on eia23 and those reported in the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2002 exceeds five percent the difference in gas reserves did not exceed five percent 

  

3 average sales prices and production costs per unit of production 

  

reference is made to page 70 of the financial section of this report average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the corporation’s own production as the divisor average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids ngl production used for this computation are shown in the reserves table on page 72 of the financial section of this report the net production volumes of natural gas available for sale used in this calculation are shown on page 75 of the financial section of this report the volumes of natural gas were converted to oilequivalent barrels based on a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel

under the new mining law effective january 1 2003 exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued license conditions are stipulated in the mining law 

  

exploration and production rights granted prior to january 1 2003 remain subject to their existing terms and differ slightly for onshore and offshore areas 

  

onshore exploration licenses were issued for a period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license was issued production concessions are granted after discoveries have been made under conditions that are negotiated with the government normally they are fieldlife concessions covering an area defined by hydrocarbon occurrences 

  

offshore exploration licenses issued between 1976 and 1996 were for a tenyear period with relinquishment of about 50 percent of the original area required at the end of six years exploration licenses granted after that time were for a period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the permit was issued production licenses are normally issued for a 40year period

syncrude operations 

  

syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of tar sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen and to produce a highquality light 32 degree api sweet synthetic crude oil the syncrude operation located near fort mcmurray alberta canada exploits a portion of the athabasca oil sands deposit the location is readily accessible by public road the produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the syncrude site to edmonton alberta by alberta oil sands pipeline ltd since startup in 1978 syncrude has produced about 15 billion barrels of synthetic crude oil imperial oil limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the jointventure exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited 

  

operating license and leases 

  

syncrude has an operating license issued by the province of alberta which is effective until 2035 this license permits syncrude to mine tar sands and produce synthetic crude oil from approved development areas on tar sands leases syncrude holds eight tar sands leases covering approximately 252000 acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit issued by the province of alberta the leases are automatically renewable as long as tar sands operations are ongoing or the leases are part of an approved development plan syncrude leases 10 12 17 22 and 34 containing proven reserves and leases 29 30 and 31 containing no proven reserves are included within a development plan approved by the province of alberta there were no known previous commercial operations on these leases prior to the startup of operations in 1978 

  

operations plant and equipment 

  

operations at syncrude involve three main processes open pit mining extraction of crude bitumen and upgrading of crude bitumen into synthetic crude oil in the base mine lease 17 the mining and transportation system uses draglines bucketwheel reclaimers and belt conveyors in the north mine leases 17 and 22 and in the aurora mine leases 10 12 and 34 truck shovel and hydrotransport systems are used production from the aurora mine commenced in 2000 the extraction facilities which separates crude bitumen from sand are capable of processing approximately 545000 tons of tar sands a day producing 110 million barrels of crude bitumen a year this represents recovery capability of about 92 percent of the crude bitumen contained in the mined tar sands 

  

crude bitumen extracted from tar sands is refined to a marketable hydrocarbon product through a combination of carbon removal in two large hightemperature fluidcoking vessels and by hydrogen addition in hightemperature highpressure hydrocracking vessels these processes remove carbon 

  

index to financial statements and sulfur and reformulate the crude into a low viscosity low sulfur highquality synthetic crude oil product in 2003 this upgrading process yielded 0860 barrels of synthetic crude oil per barrel of crude bitumen in 2003 about 55 percent of the synthetic crude oil was processed by edmonton area refineries and the remaining 45 percent was pipelined to refineries in eastern canada and the midwestern united states electricity is provided to syncrude by a 270 megawatt electricity generating plant and an 80 megawatt electricity generating plant both located at syncrude the generating plants are owned by the syncrude participants imperial oil limited’s 25 percent share of net investment in plant property and equipment including surface mining facilities transportation equipment and upgrading facilities was about 17 billion at yearend 2003 

  

synthetic crude oil reserves 

  

the crude bitumen is contained within the unconsolidated sands of the mcmurray formation ore bodies are buried beneath 50 to 150 feet of overburden have bitumen grades ranging from 4 to 14 weight percent and ore thickness of 115 to 160 feet estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of inplace crude bitumen volume the mining plan historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits the inplace volume depth and grade are established through extensive and closely spaced core drilling proven reserves include the operating base and north mines and the aurora mine in accordance with the approved mining plan there are an estimated 3295 million tons of extractable tar sands in the base and north mines with an average bitumen grade of 104 weight percent in addition at the aurora mine there are an estimated 4050 million tons of extractable tar sands at an average bitumen grade of 113 weight percent after deducting royalties payable to the province of alberta imperial oil limited estimates that its 25 percent net share of proven reserves at yearend 2003 was equivalent to 781 million barrels of synthetic crude oil 

  

in 2001 the syncrude owners endorsed a further development of the syncrude resource in the area and expansion of the upgrading facilities the syncrude aurora 2 and upgrader expansion 1 project adds a remote mining train and expands the central processing and upgrading plant this expansion is under way and will lead to total production capacity of about 350 thousand barrels of synthetic crude oil per day gross when completed

factors affecting future results 

  

competitive factors the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of various goods or services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes a key component of the corporation’s competitive position particularly given the commoditybased nature of many of its products is its ability to manage operating expenses successfully which requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency 

  

political factors the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to time in varying degree by 

  

political instability and by other political developments and laws and regulations such as forced divestiture of assets restrictions on production imports and exports war or other international conflicts civil unrest and local security concerns that threaten the safe operation of company facilities price controls tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations both the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 

  

industry and economic factors the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout the world are affected by local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil natural gas petroleum products petrochemicals and other exxonmobil products these events or conditions are generally not predictable and include among other things general economic growth rates and the occurrence of economic recessions the development of new supply sources adherence by countries to opec quotas supply disruptions weather including seasonal patterns that affect energy demand and severe weather events that can disrupt operations technological advances including advances in exploration production refining and petrochemical manufacturing technology and advances in technology relating to energy usage changes in demographics including population growth rates and consumer preferences and the competitiveness of alternative hydrocarbon or other energy sources or product substitutes 

  

project factors in addition to the factors cited above the advancement cost and results of particular exxonmobil projects depend on the outcome of negotiations with partners governments suppliers customers or others changes in operating conditions or costs and the occurrence of unforeseen technical difficulties 

  

market risk factors see pages 33 and 34 of the financial section of this report for discussion of the impact of market risks inflation and other uncertainties 

  

projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobil’s plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1 2 7 and 7a of this report are forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report 

  










 item 2 properties 

  

part of the information in response to this item and to the securities exchange act industry guide 2 is contained in the financial section of this report in note 10 which note appears on page 47 and on pages 62 through 67 

  

information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows 

  

   

estimated proved reserves are shown on pages 64 and 65 of the financial section of this report no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since december 31 2002 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date for information on the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves see page 66 of the financial section of this report 

  

  

the estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines in certain deepwater fields proved reserves are occasionally recorded before flow tests are conducted because of the safety and cost implications of conducting the tests in those situations other industry accepted analyses are used such as information from well logs a thorough pressure and fluid sampling program conventional core data obtained across the entire reservoir interval and nearby analog data historically proved reserves recorded using these methods have been immaterial when compared to the corporation’s total proved reserves and have also been validated by subsequent flow tests or actual production levels in addition the corporation records proved reserves in conjunction with significant funding commitments made towards development of the reserves 

  

2 estimates of total net proved oil and gas reserves filed with other federal agencies 

  

during 2002 exxonmobil filed proved reserves estimates with the us department of energy on forms eia23 and eia28 the information on form eia28 is presented on the same basis as the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2001 which shows exxonmobil’s net interests in all liquids and gas reserve volumes and changes thereto from both exxonmobiloperated properties and properties operated by others the data on form eia23 although consistent with the data on form eia28 is presented on a different basis and includes 100 percent of the oil and gas volumes from exxonmobiloperated properties only regardless of the company’s net interest in addition form eia23 information does not include gas plant liquids the difference between the oil and gas reserves reported on eia23 and those reported in the registrant’s annual report on form 10k for 2001 exceeds five percent 

  

3 average sales prices and production costs per unit of production 

  

reference is made to page 62 of the financial section of this report average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from our own production as the divisor average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids ngl production used for this computation are shown in the reserves table on page 64 of the financial section of this report the net production volumes of natural gas available for sale used in this calculation are shown on page 67 of the financial section of this report the volumes of natural gas were converted to oilequivalent barrels based on a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel

information with regard to mining activities follows  

  

syncrude operations 

  

syncrude is a jointventure established to recover shallow deposits of tar sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen and to produce a highquality light 32 degree api sweet synthetic crude oil the syncrude operation located near fort mcmurray alberta canada exploits a portion of the athabasca oil sands deposit the location is readily accessible by public road the produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the syncrude site to edmonton alberta by alberta oil sands pipeline ltd since startup in 1978 syncrude has produced about 14 billion barrels of synthetic crude oil imperial oil limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the jointventure exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial oil limited 

  

operating license and leases 

  

syncrude has an operating license issued by the province of alberta which is effective until 2035 this license permits syncrude to mine tar sands and produce synthetic crude oil from approved development areas on tar sands leases syncrude holds eight tar sands leases covering approximately 252000 acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit issued by the province of alberta the leases are automatically renewable as long as tar sands operations are ongoing or the leases are part of an approved development plan syncrude leases 10 12 17 22 and 34 containing proven reserves and leases 29 30 and 31 containing no proven reserves are included within a development plan approved by the province of alberta’s department of resource development there were no known previous commercial operations on these leases prior to the startup of operations in 1978 

  

operations plant and equipment 

  

operations at syncrude involve three main processes open pit mining extraction of crude bitumen and upgrading of crude bitumen into synthetic crude oil in the base mine lease 17 the mining and transportation system uses draglines bucketwheel reclaimers and belt conveyors in the north mine leases 17 and 22 and in the aurora mine leases 10 12 and 34 truck shovel and hydrotransport systems are used production from the aurora mine commenced in 2000 the extraction facilities which separates crude bitumen from sand are capable of processing approximately 545000 tons of tar sands a day producing 110 million barrels of crude bitumen a year this represents recovery capability of about 92 percent of the crude bitumen contained in the mined tar sands 

  

crude bitumen extracted from tar sands is refined to a marketable hydrocarbon product through a combination of carbon removal in two large hightemperature fluidcoking vessels and by hydrogen addition in hightemperature highpressure hydrocracking vessels these processes remove carbon and sulfur and reformulate the crude into a low viscosity low sulfur highquality synthetic crude oil product in 2002 this upgrading process yielded 0863 barrels of synthetic crude oil per barrel of crude bitumen in 2002 about 60 percent of the synthetic crude oil was processed by edmonton area refineries and the remaining 40 percent was pipelined to refineries in eastern canada and the midwestern united states electricity is provided to syncrude by a 270 megawatt electricity generating plant and an 80 megawatt electricity generating plant both located at syncrude the generating plants 

  

are owned by the syncrude participants imperial oil limited’s 25 percent share of net investment in plant property and equipment including surface mining facilities transportation equipment and upgrading facilities was about 10 billion at year end 2002 

  

synthetic crude oil reserves 

  

the crude bitumen is contained within the unconsolidated sands of the mcmurray formation ore bodies are buried beneath 50 to 150 feet of overburden have bitumen grades ranging from 4 to 14 weight percent and ore thickness of 115 to 160 feet estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of inplace crude bitumen volume the mining plan historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits the inplace volume depth and grade are established through extensive and closely spaced core drilling proven reserves include the operating base and north mines and the aurora mine in accordance with the approved mining plan there are an estimated 3295 million tons of extractable tar sands in the base and north mines with an average bitumen grade of 104 weight percent in addition at the aurora mine there are an estimated 4050 million tons of extractable tar sands at an average bitumen grade of 113 weight percent after deducting royalties payable to the province of alberta imperial oil limited estimates that its 25 percent net share of proven reserves at year end 2002 was equivalent to 800 million barrels of synthetic crude oil 

  

in 2001 the syncrude owners endorsed a further development of the syncrude resource in the area and expansion of the upgrading facilities the syncrude aurora 2 and upgrader expansion 1 project adds a remote mining train and expands the central processing and upgrading plant this expansion will lead to total production of about 370 thousand barrels of synthetic crude oil per day gross when completed

factors affecting future results


   competitive factors  the energy and petrochemical industries are highly
competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other
industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and
individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or
purchase of various goods or services in many national and international
markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate
for such purposes a key component of the corporations competitive position
particularly given the commoditybased nature of many of its products is its
ability to manage operating expenses successfully which requires continuous
management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency

   political factors  the operations and earnings of the corporation and its
affiliates throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected
from time to time in varying degree by political instability and by other
political developments and laws and regulations such as forced divestiture of
assets restrictions on production imports and exports war or other
international conflicts civil unrest and local security concerns that threaten
the safe operation of company facilities price controls tax increases and
retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation of

page

contract rights and environmental regulations both the likelihood of such
occurrences and their overall effect upon the corporation vary greatly from
country to country and are not predictable

   industry and economic factors  the operations and earnings of the
corporation and its affiliates throughout the world are affected by local
regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil
natural gas petroleum products petrochemicals and other exxonmobil products
these events or conditions are generally not predictable and include among
other things general economic growth rates and the occurrence of economic
recessions the development of new supply sources adherence by countries to
opec quotas supply disruptions weather including seasonal patterns that
affect energy demand and severe weather events that can disrupt operations
technological advances including advances in exploration production
refining and petrochemical manufacturing technology and advances in technology
relating to energy usage changes in demographics including population growth
rates and consumer preferences and the competitiveness of alternative energy
sources or product substitutes

   project factors  in addition to the factors cited above the advancement
cost and results of particular exxonmobil projects depend on the outcome of
negotiations with partners governments suppliers customers or others
changes in operating conditions or costs and the occurrence of unforeseen
technical difficulties

   market risk factors  see pages 29 and 30 of the financial section of this
report for discussion of the impact of market risks inflation and other
uncertainties

   projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobils plans and objectives
included or incorporated in items 1 2 7 and 7a of this report are
forwardlooking statements actual future results including project completion
dates production rates capital expenditures costs and business plans could
differ materially due to among other things the factors discussed above and

1  net reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids millions of barrels and
        natural gas billions of cubic feet at yearend 2001

   estimated proved reserves are shown on pages 59 and 60 of the financial
section of this report no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event
has occurred since december 31 2001 that would cause a significant change in
the estimated proved reserves as of that date for information on the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil
and gas reserves see page 61 of the financial section of this report

2  estimates of total net proved oil and gas reserves filed with other federal
agencies

   during 2001 exxonmobil filed proved reserves estimates with the us
department of energy on forms eia23 and eia28 the information on form eia28
is presented on the same basis as the registrants annual report on form 10k
for 2000 which shows exxonmobils net interests in all liquids and gas reserve
volumes and changes thereto from both exxonmobiloperated properties and
properties operated by others the data on form eia23 although consistent
with the data on

                                      2

form eia28 is presented on a different basis and includes 100 percent of the
oil and gas volumes from exxonmobiloperated properties only regardless of the
companys net interest in addition form eia23 information does not include
gas plant liquids the difference between the oil reserves reported on eia23
and those reported in the registrants annual report on form 10k for 2000
exceeds five percent the difference in gas reserves did not exceed five
percent

3  average sales prices and production costs per unit of production

   reference is made to page 57 of the financial section of this report
average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from our
own production as the divisor average production costs have been computed by
using net production quantities for the divisor the volumes of crude oil and
natural gas liquids ngl production used for this computation are shown in the
reserves table on page 59 of the financial section of this report the net
production volumes of natural gas available for sale used in this calculation
are shown on page 62 of the financial section of this report the volumes of
natural gas were converted to oilequivalent barrels based on a conversion
factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel

7  summary of acreage terms in key areas

united states

   oil and gas leases have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years
and a production period that normally remains in effect until production
ceases in some instances a fee interest is acquired where both the surface
and the underlying mineral interests are owned outright

canada

   exploration permits are granted for varying periods of time with renewals
possible production leases are held as long as there is production on the
lease the majority of cold lake leases were taken for an initial 21year term
in 19681969 and renewed for a second 21year term in 19891990 the
exploration acreage in eastern canada is currently held by work commitments of
various amounts

europe

   france

   exploration permits are granted for periods of three to five years and are
renewable up to two times accompanied by substantial acreage relinquishments
50 percent of the acreage at first renewal 25 percent of the remaining acreage
at second renewal a 1994 law requires a bidding process prior to granting of
an exploration permit upon discovery of commercial hydrocarbons a production

   exxonmobils net acreage totaled 04 million acres at yearend 2001 with
17 net exploration and development wells completed during 2001 production
capacity from the tengiz field has increased with the full year impact of the
fifth processing train and the implementation of gas handling debottlenecking
projects development planning to further increase production is ongoing

   the caspian pipeline consortium pipeline for transporting oil from tengiz
and other caspian fields and nearby areas to the russian black sea port of
novorossiysk started up in late 2001 the pipeline will mitigate the high cost
of rail and barge transportation

   appraisal and initial development planning continue for the offshore

   qatar

   production and development activities continued on two major liquefied
natural gas lng projects in qatarqatargas qatar liquefied gas company
limited and rasgas ras laffan liquefied natural gas company ltd the
qatargas lng facilities have three lng trains with a total combined sales
capacity of 74 mta million metric tons per annum of lng plus associated
condensate in october 2001 qatargas awarded engineering procurement and
construction epc contracts for the debottlenecking of the three lng trains
which will increase total sales capacity to 89 mta by 2005 the rasgas lng
facilities have two lng trains with a total combined sales capacity of 66 mta
of lng plus associated condensate in an ongoing effort to expand lng sales
capacity from qatar in april 2001 rasgas awarded an epc contract for a third
lng train with sales capacity of 47 mta of lng plus associated condensate as
part of the rasgas expansion project

   in addition to the two existing lng projects in qatar the enhanced gas
utilization egu project will provide 175 billion cubic feet per day of gas
sales plus associated condensate production and liquefied petroleum gases
lpgs exports from qatars north field engineering and design of the egu gas
production facilities were completed in 2000 with engineering and design of the
associated natural gas liquids fractionation and lpg export facilities
continuing through 2001 gas from the egu project is targeted for domestic use
and interregional sales via pipeline an agreement in principle on key terms
to supply kuwait with qatari gas from the egu project was announced in january
2002 a memorandum of understanding was signed with bahrain for additional
pipeline sales from the egu project

160 net exploration and development wells completed during the year the cerro
negro heavy oil project began production in 1999 and the central processing
facility was completed in the fourth quarter 2000 construction activities on
the upgrader facility at the jose industrial complex were completed mid2001
and the entire project was officially inaugurated in september 2001

worldwide exploration

   at yearend 2001 exploration activities were underway in several areas in
which exxonmobil has no established production operations a total of 258
million net acres were held at yearend 2001 and 68 net exploration wells
were completed during the year

information with regard to mining activities follows


   syncrude operations

   syncrude is a jointventure established to recover shallow deposits of tar
sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen and to
produce a highquality light 32 degree api sweet synthetic crude oil the
syncrude operation located near fort mcmurray alberta canada exploits a
portion of the athabasca oil sands deposit the location is readily accessible
by public road the produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the syncrude
site to edmonton alberta in the alberta oil sands pipeline owned by the
pembina oil sands pipeline limited partnership since startup in 1978
syncrude has produced about 13 billion barrels of synthetic crude oil
imperial oil limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the
jointventure exxon mobil corporation has a 696 percent interest in imperial
oil limited

   operating license and leases

   syncrude has an operating license issued by the province of alberta which is
effective until 2035 this license permits syncrude to mine tar sands and
produce synthetic crude oil from approved development areas on tar sands
leases syncrude holds eight tar sands leases covering approximately 255000
acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit issued by the province of alberta
the leases are automatically renewable as long as tar sands operations are
ongoing or the leases are part of an approved development plan syncrude leases
10 12 17 22 and 34 containing proven reserves and leases 29 30 and 31
containing no proven reserves are included within a development plan approved
by the province of albertas department of resource development there were no
known previous commercial operations on these leases prior to the startup of
operations in 1978

   operations plant and equipment

   operations at syncrude involve three main processes open pit mining
extraction of crude bitumen and upgrading of crude bitumen into synthetic crude
oil in the base mine lease 17 the mining and transportation system uses
draglines bucketwheel reclaimers and belt conveyors in the north mine leases
17 and 22 and in the aurora mine leases 10 12 and 34 truck shovel and
hydrotransport systems are used production from the aurora mine commenced in
2000 the extraction facilities which separate crude bitumen from sand are
capable of processing approximately 545000 tons of tar sands a day producing
110 million barrels of crude bitumen a year this represents recovery
capability of about 92 percent of the crude bitumen contained in the mined tar
sands

   crude bitumen extracted from tar sands is refined to a marketable
hydrocarbon product through a combination of carbon removal in two large
hightemperature fluidcoking vessels and by hydrogen

                                      14

page

addition in hightemperature highpressure hydrocracking vessels these
processes remove carbon and sulfur and reformulate the crude into a low
viscosity low sulfur highquality synthetic crude oil product in 2001 this
upgrading process yielded 0845 barrels of synthetic crude oil per barrel of
crude bitumen about twothirds of the synthetic crude oil is processed by
edmonton area refineries and the remaining onethird is pipelined to refineries
in eastern canada and the midwestern united states electricity is provided to
syncrude by a 270 megawatt electricity generating plant and an 80 megawatt
electricity generating plant both located at syncrude the generating plants
are owned by the syncrude participants imperial oil limiteds 25 percent share
of net investment in plant property and equipment including surface mining
facilities transportation equipment and upgrading facilities was 750 million
at year end 2001

   synthetic crude oil reserves

   the crude bitumen is contained within the unconsolidated sands of the
mcmurray formation ore bodies are buried beneath 50 to 150 feet of overburden
have bitumen grades ranging from 4 to 14 weight percent and ore thickness of
115 to 160 feet estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on
detailed geological and engineering assessments of inplace crude bitumen
volume the mining plan historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield
factors installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits the
inplace volume depth and grade are established through extensive and closely
spaced core drilling proven reserves include the operating base and north
mines and the aurora mine in accordance with the approved mining plan there
are an estimated 3500 million tons of extractable tar sands in the base and
north mines with an average bitumen grade of 104 weight percent in addition
at the aurora mine there are an estimated 4090 million tons of extractable
tar sands at an average bitumen grade of 113 weight percent after deducting
royalties payable to the province of alberta imperial oil limited estimates
that its 25 percent net share of proven reserves at year end 2001 was
equivalent to 821 million barrels of synthetic crude oil

   in 2001 the syncrude owners endorsed a further development of the syncrude
resource in the area and expansion of the upgrading facilities the syncrude
aurora 2 and upgrader expansion 1 project adds a remote mining development and
expands the central processing and upgrading plant this expansion increases
proven syncrude reserves by 230 million barrels and will lead to total
production of about 370 thousand barrels of synthetic crude oil per day gross
when completed

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations

the following discussion and analysis of exxonmobils financial results as well
as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated
financial statements to which they refer are the responsibility of the
management of exxon mobil corporation the corporations accounting and
financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving
the extracting refining and marketing of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbonbased
products the corporations business model involves the production or
purchase manufacture and sale of physical products and all commercial
activities are directly in support of the underlying physical movement of goods

     this straightforward approach extends to the financing of the business in
evaluating business or investment opportunities the corporation views as
economically equivalent any debt obligation whether disclosed on the face of
the consolidated balance sheet or disclosed as other debtlike obligations in
notes to the financial statements such as those summarized in the table on page
26 this consistent conservative approach to financing the capitalintensive
needs of the corporation has helped exxonmobil to sustain the triplea status
of its longterm debt securities for more than eighty years

review of 2001 results

earnings excluding merger effects and special items were 15630 million a
decrease of 1280 million from 2000 net income in 2001 was 15320 million
including 215 million of extraordinary gains and 525 million of merger costs
a decrease of 2400 million from 2000 which benefited from 810 million in net
favorable merger effects including gains from divestments required as a
condition of regulatory approval of the merger upstream exploration and
production earnings in 2001 declined following lower crude oil realizations
which on average were down 18 percent versus 2000 upstream volumes in 2001 on
an oil equivalent basis were up 1 percent excluding the effect of reduced
natural gas production operations in indonesia due to security concerns
downstream refining and marketing earnings improved from 2000 reflecting
stronger us refining margins and improved marketing results outside of the
us chemicals earnings declined versus 2000 as lower product realizations and
weakening demand conditions put significant pressure on commodity margins and
more than offset the 175 million of extraordinary gains associated with asset
management activities prime product sales volumes were 1 percent higher than
2000 reflecting capacity additions in singapore and saudi arabia merger
implementation activities in 2001 reduced earnings by a net 485 million gains
from asset divestitures that were a condition of regulatory approval of the
merger added 40 million to earnings partly offsetting merger implementation
expenses of 525 million revenue for 2001 totaled 213 billion down 8 percent
from 2000

     excluding merger expenses the combined total of operating costs including
operating selling general administrative exploration depreciation and
depletion expenses from the consolidated statement of income and exxonmobils
share of similar costs for equity companies in 2001 was 440 billion up 400
million from 2000 cost increases associated with new operations higher energy
costs and higher pensionrelated expenses were substantially offset by the
favorable impact of continuing efficiency initiatives carried out in all
business lines the impact of these initiatives including the capture of merger
synergies reduced operating costs by 12 billion in 2001 and cumulatively by
4 billion since 1998 interest expense in 2001 was 293 million compared to
589 million in 2000 reflecting lower debt levels and interest rates

upstream

upstream earnings of 10429 million decreased 1940 million or 16 percent
from last years record level primarily due to lower crude oil prices the
impacts of lower crude realizations and higher exploration expenses in future
growth areas were partly offset by higher average natural gas realizations
principally in north america and europe us and canadian natural gas prices
reached historical highs early in 2001 but dropped through the remainder of the
year liquids production in 2001 of 2542 kbd thousands of barrels daily was
down slightly from 2000 as natural field declines in mature areas were largely
offset by new volumes from work programs and new developments in the north sea
us equatorial guinea and kazakhstan some of which have not yet reached full
capacity absent the effect of reduced arun operations in indonesia due to
security concerns worldwide gas production was up about 2 percent with
increases in europe australia canada and qatar including the impact of lower
indonesia volumes fullyear 2001 worldwide natural gas production of 10279
mcfd millions of cubic feet daily compared with 10343 mcfd in 2000 combined
liquids and gas volumes on an oil equivalent basis were up 1 percent excluding
the effect of reduced natural gas production operations in indonesia earnings
from us upstream operations were 3932 million a decrease of 613 million
earnings outside the us were 6497 million 1327 million lower than 2000

downstream

downstream earnings of 4227 million were a record and improved 24 percent over
2000 results benefited from higher refining margins early in the year
particularly in the us improved worldwide refining operations and higher
marketing margins outside the us refining margins in most areas peaked in the
second quarter and declined during the second half of 2001 earnings also
benefited from a planned reduction in inventories as a result of optimizing
operations around the world petroleum product sales of 7971 kbd compared with
7993 kbd in the prior year excluding the effect of the required merger related
divestments in 2000 volumes were up slightly refinery throughput was 5571 kbd
compared with 5642 kbd in 2000 us downstream earnings were 1924 million
up 363 million reflecting stronger refining margins and improved operations
earnings outside the us of 2303 million were 446 million higher than 2000
the improvement was driven by stronger marketing margins partly offset by
weaker european refining margins

chemicals

chemicals earnings totaled 882 million including 175 million of net gains on
asset management activities absent this special item chemicals earnings were
707 million a decrease of 454 million from 2000 most of the reduction
occurred in the us as lower product realizations and weakening demand
conditions put significant pressure on

                                       24

page

commodity margins record prime product sales volumes of 25780 kt thousands of
metric tons were 1 percent above the prior years record level as higher sales
outside the us reflecting capacity additions in singapore and saudi arabia
were partly offset by lower sales in the us reflecting weaker industrial
demand

other operations

earnings from other operating segments totaled 489 million a decrease of 62
million from 2000 reflecting lower copper prices

corporate and financing

corporate and financing expenses decreased 367 million to 222 million
reflecting lower net interest costs due to lower debt levels and higher cash
balances along with favorable foreign exchange and tax effects

review of 2000 results

earnings excluding merger effects and special items were 16910 million an
increase of 8530 million from 1999 net income in 2000 of 17720 million
including net favorable merger effects of 810 million increased 9810 million
from 1999 upstream earnings benefited from higher crude oil and natural gas
realizations which on average were up about 60 percent and 45 percent
respectively versus 1999 excluding the effects of lower entitlements caused by
higher crude prices liquids production was 3 percent higher than 1999
downstream earnings improved from the very depressed results in 1999 driven by
stronger worldwide refining margins and better refining operations however
downstream profitability was restrained by difficulties in recovering the
significant increases in raw material costs that occurred over much of the year
merger implementation activities in 2000 added a net 810 million to net income
reflecting 1730 million of extraordinary gains from asset divestitures that
were a condition of regulatory approval of the merger these gains more than
offset merger implementation expenses of 920 million results in 1999 included
470 million of net charges for special items primarily merger expenses with
other special items essentially offsetting revenue for 2000 totaled 233
billion up 25 percent from 1999 and the cost of crude oil and product
purchases increased by 41 percent both influenced by higher prices

     excluding merger expenses the combined total of operating costs including
operating selling general administrative exploration depreciation and
depletion expenses from the consolidated statement of income and exxonmobils
share of similar costs for equity companies in 2000 was 436 billion down
about 700 million from 1999 the impact of efficiency initiatives including
the capture of merger synergies reduced operating costs by 16 billion
interest expense in 2000 was 589 million compared to 695 million in 1999 as
the effect of lower debt levels was partly offset by higher interest rates

upstream

upstream earnings of 12369 million were a record and increased due to higher
crude oil and natural gas realizations up about 60 percent and 45 percent
respectively liquids production of 2553 kbd increased from 2517 kbd in 1999
excluding the effects of lower entitlements caused by higher crude prices
liquids production was 3 percent higher than 1999 mainly reflecting new
production from fields in the north sea and venezuela and increased production
from eastern canada and alaska these increases more than offset the effects of
natural field declines natural gas production of 10343 mcfd was about the same
as 1999 reflecting higher production in eastern canada europe and qatar offset
by lower production in indonesia excluding entitlement impacts natural gas
production increased about 1 percent lower exploration expenses also benefited
2000 upstream earnings earnings from us upstream operations were 4545
million an increase of 2703 million from 1999 earnings outside the us were
7824 million 3899 million higher than last year excluding a 141 million
deferred tax benefit and a 22 million property writeoff in 1999

downstream

downstream earnings of 3418 million improved over 2 billion from the very
depressed results in 1999 driven by stronger worldwide refining margins and
better refining operations earnings also benefited from a planned reduction in
inventories as a result of merging exxon and mobil operations around the world
petroleum product sales of 7993 kbd compared with 8887 kbd in 1999 the
decrease reflected the effects of the required divestiture of mobils european
fuels joint venture and of us marketing and refining assets as well as lower
supply sales in asiapacific resulting from the low margin environment refinery
throughput was 5642 kbd compared with 5977 kbd in 1999 excluding the effects
of the divestments refinery throughput in 2000 was at the same level as 1999
and petroleum product sales were down about 4 percent earnings from us
downstream operations were 1561 million up 984 million from the depressed
results of 1999 reflecting stronger refining margins and improved operations
partly offset by weaker marketing margins earnings outside the us of 1857
million were 1087 million higher than 1999 after excluding special charges in
1999 in japan of 80 million for nonmerger related restructuring of downstream
operations and a 40 million writeoff associated with the cancellation of a
power project the improvement was driven by stronger european and to a much
lesser extent southeast asian refining margins and improved refining operations
partly offset by weaker marketing margins

chemicals

chemicals earnings totaled 1161 million compared with 1354 million in 1999
prime product sales volumes of 25637 kt were up 354 kt the decline in earnings
was driven by higher feedstock and energy costs and unfavorable foreign exchange
effects

other operations

earnings from other operating segments totaled 551 million an increase of 125
million from 1999 reflecting record copper and coal sales higher copper
prices lower operating expenses and favorable foreign exchange effects partly
offset by lower coal prices

corporate and financing

corporate and financing expenses of 589 million compared with 514 million in
1999 the increase resulted from unfavorable foreign exchange effects and lower
taxrelated benefits partly offset by a reduction in administrative expenses as
a result of combining exxon and mobil headquarters operations the effect of
lower debt levels was partly offset by higher interest rates during the year

operations

liquidity and capital resources

in 2001 cash provided by operating activities totaled 229 billion the same
level as 2000 major sources of funds were net income of 153 billion and
noncash provisions of 79 billion for depreciation and depletion

     cash used in investing activities totaled 82 billion up 49 billion
from 2000 due to lower proceeds from sales of subsidiaries investments and
property plant and equipment resulting from the absence of the asset
divestitures in 2000 that were required as a condition of the regulatory
approval of the merger and due to higher additions to property plant and
equipment

     cash used in financing activities was 150 billion up 09 billion
driven by higher purchases of common shares offset by lower debt reductions
dividend payments on common shares increased from 088 per share to 091 per
share and totaled 63 billion a payout of 41 percent total consolidated
shortterm and longterm debt declined by 26 billion to 108 billion
shareholders equity increased by 24 billion to 732 billion

     during 2001 exxon mobil corporation purchased 139 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of 5721 million these purchases
were to offset shares issued in conjunction with company benefit plans and
programs and to reduce the number of shares outstanding shares outstanding were
reduced from 6930 million at the end of 2000 to 6809 million at the end of
2001 purchases were made in both the open market and through negotiated
transactions and may be discontinued at any time

     in 2000 cash provided by operating activities totaled 229 billion up
79 billion from 1999 major sources of funds were net income of 177 billion
and noncash provisions of 81 billion for depreciation and depletion

     cash used in investing activities totaled 33 billion down 77 billion
from 1999 due to higher proceeds from sales of subsidiaries investments and
property plant and equipment resulting from asset divestitures that were
required as a condition of the regulatory approval of the merger and due to
lower additions to property plant and equipment

     cash used in financing activities was 142 billion up 94 billion
driven by debt reductions in the current year versus debt increases in 1999
along with higher purchases of common shares dividend payments on common shares
increased from 0844 per share to 0880 per share and totaled 61 billion a
payout of 35 percent total consolidated shortterm and longterm debt declined
by 56 billion to 134 billion shareholders equity increased by 73 billion
to 708 billion

     prior to the merger the corporation purchased shares of its common stock
for the treasury consistent with pooling accounting requirements this
repurchase program was terminated effective with the close of the exxonmobil
merger on november 30 1999 on august 1 2000 the corporation announced its
intention to purchase shares of its common stock during 2000 exxon mobil
corporation purchased 54 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at
a gross cost of 2352 million these purchases were to offset shares issued in
conjunction with company benefit plans and programs and to reduce the number of
shares outstanding shares outstanding were reduced from 6955 million at the
end of 1999 to 6930 million at the end of 2000 purchases were made in both the
open market and through negotiated transactions

     although the corporation issues longterm debt from time to time and
maintains a revolving commercial paper program internally generated funds cover
the majority of its financial requirements the management of cash that may be
temporarily available as surplus to the corporations immediate needs is
carefully controlled both to optimize returns on cash balances and to ensure
its secure ready availability to meet the corporations cash requirements as
they arise

longterm contractual obligations and
other commercial commitments

set forth below is information about the corporations longterm contractual
obligations and other commercial commitments outstanding at december 31 2001
it brings together data for easy reference from the consolidated balance sheet
and from individual notes to consolidated financial statements this information
is important in understanding the financial position of the corporation in
considering the economic viablity of investment opportunities the corporation
views any source of financing whether it be operating leases third party
guarantees or equity company debt as being economically equivalent to
consolidated debt of the corporation

pertain to pipeline throughput agreements the present value of these
commitments excluding imputed interest of 733 million totaled 1296 million

6 firm commitments related to capital projects shown on an undiscounted
basis totaled approximately 39 billion at the end of 2001 compared with 46
billion at yearend 2000 the largest single commitment outstanding at yearend
2001 was 21 billion associated with the development of crude oil and natural
gas resources in malaysia the corporation expects to fund the majority of these
commitments through internal cash flow

other commercial commitments

the corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently
liable at december 31 2001 for 3921 million primarily relating to
guarantees for notes loans and performance under contracts note 17 this
included 672 million representing guarantees of nonus excise taxes and
customs duties of other companies entered into as a normal business practice
under reciprocal arrangements also included in this amount were guarantees by
consolidated affiliates of 1641 million representing exxonmobils share of
obligations of certain equity companies

     on december 31 2001 unused credit lines for shortterm financing totaled
approximately 53 billion note 7

     management views the corporations financial strength as evidenced by the
above financial ratios and other similar measures to be a competitive advantage
of strategic importance the corporations sound financial position gives it the
opportunity to access the worlds capital markets in the full range of market
conditions and enables the corporation to take on large longterm capital
commitments in the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value

     in addition to the above commitments the corporation makes limited use of
derivative instruments which are discussed in risk management on page 29 and
note 14 on page 44

litigation and other contingencies

as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements a number of
lawsuits including class actions were brought in various courts against exxon
mobil corporation and certain of its subsidiaries relating to the accidental
release of crude oil from the tanker exxon valdez in 1989 the vast majority of
the claims have been resolved leaving a few compensatory damages cases to be
tried all of the punitive damage claims were consolidated in the civil trial
that began in may 1994

     in that trial on september 24 1996 the united states district court for
the district of alaska entered a judgment in the amount of 5058 billion the
district court awarded approximately 196 million in compensatory damages to
fisher plaintiffs 38 million in prejudgment interest on the compensatory
damages and 5 billion in punitive damages to a class composed of all persons
and entities who asserted claims for punitive damages from the corporation as a
result of the exxon valdez grounding the district court also ordered that these
awards shall bear interest from and after entry of the judgment the district
court stayed execution on the judgment pending appeal based on a 675 billion
letter of credit posted by the corporation exxonmobil appealed the judgment on
november 7 2001 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
vacated the punitive damage award as being excessive under the constitution and
remanded the case to the district court for it to determine the amount of the
punitive damage award consistent with the ninth circuits holding the ninth
circuit upheld the compensatory damage award which has been paid the letter of
credit was terminated on february 1 2002 the ultimate cost to the corporation
from the lawsuits arising from the exxon valdez grounding is not possible to
predict and may not be resolved for a number of years

     on december 19 2000 a jury in montgomery county alabama returned a
verdict against the corporation in a contract dispute over royalties in the
amount of 8769 million in compensatory damages and 342 billion in punitive
damages in the case of exxon corporation v state of alabama et al the verdict
was upheld by the trial court on may 4 2001 exxonmobil has appealed the
judgment and believes it should be set aside or substantially reduced on factual
and constitutional grounds the ultimate outcome is not expected to have a
materially adverse effect upon the corporations operations or financial
condition

     on may 22 2001 a state court jury in new orleans louisiana returned a
verdict against the corporation and three other entities in a case brought by a
landowner claiming damage to his property the property had been leased by the
landowner to a company that performed pipe cleaning and storage services for
customers including the corporation the jury awarded the plaintiff 56 million
in compensatory damages 90 percent to be paid by the corporation and 1
billion in punitive damages all to be paid by the corporation the damage
related to the presence of naturally occurring radioactive material norm on
the site resulting from pipe cleaning operations the award has been upheld at
the trial court exxonmobil will appeal the judgment to the louisiana fourth
circuit court of appeals and believes that the judgment should be set aside or
substantially reduced on factual and constitutional grounds the ultimate
outcome is not expected to have a materially adverse effect upon the
corporations operations or financial condition

     the us tax court has decided the issue with respect to the pricing of
crude oil purchased from saudi arabia for the years 19791981 in favor of the
corporation this decision is subject to appeal certain other issues for the
years 19791993 remain pending before the tax court the ultimate resolution of
these issues and several other tax and legal issues including resolution of tax
issues related to the gas lifting imbalance along the germandutch border is
not expected to have a materially adverse effect upon the corporations
operations or financial condition

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations

     there are no events or uncertainties known to management beyond those
already included in reported financial information that would indicate a
material change in future operating results or financial condition

capital and exploration expenditures

capital and exploration expenditures in 2001 were 123 billion up from 112
billion in 2000 reflecting the corporations active investment program

     upstream spending was up 27 percent to 88 billion in 2001 from 69
billion in 2000 as a result of higher spending on major projects in africa the
north sea and canada and increased drilling activity capital investments in
the downstream totaled 23 billion in 2001 down 03 billion from 2000
primarily reflecting timing of investments in china partly offset by increased
spending in the retail businesses chemicals capital expenditures were 09
billion in 2001 down from 15 billion in 2000 due to the completion of major
projects in singapore and saudi arabia and timing of investment in china

     capital and exploration expenditures in the us totaled 39 billion in
2001 an increase of 06 billion from 2000 reflecting higher spending in both
the upstream and chemicals partly offset by lower spending in the downstream
spending outside the us of 84 billion in 2001 was up 05 billion from 2000
reflecting higher expenditures in the upstream partly offset by lower
expenditures in the downstream and chemicals

merger of exxon corporation and mobil corporation

on november 30 1999 a whollyowned subsidiary of exxon corporation exxon
merged with mobil corporation mobil so that mobil became a whollyowned
subsidiary of exxon the merger at the same time exxon changed its name to
exxon mobil corporation exxonmobil under the terms of the agreement
approximately 10 billion shares of exxonmobil common stock were issued in
exchange for all the outstanding shares of mobil common stock based upon an
exchange ratio of 132015 following the exchange former shareholders of exxon
owned approximately 70 percent of the corporation while former mobil
shareholders owned approximately 30 percent of the corporation each outstanding
share of mobil preferred stock was converted into one share of a new class of
exxonmobil preferred stock

     as a result of the merger the accounts of certain downstream and chemicals
operations jointly controlled by the combining companies have been included in
the consolidated financial statements these operations were previously
accounted for by exxon and mobil as separate companies using the equity method
of accounting

     the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests accordingly the
consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the merger with
all periods presented as if exxon and mobil had always been combined

     as a condition of the approval of the merger the us federal trade
commission and the european commission required that certain property primarily
downstream pipeline and natural gas distribution assets be divested the
carrying value of these assets was approximately 3 billion and beforetax
proceeds were approximately 5 billion net aftertax gains of 40 million and
1730 million were reported in 2001 and 2000 respectively as extraordinary
items consistent with pooling of interests accounting requirements the divested
properties historically earned approximately 200 million per year

merger expenses and reorganization reserves

in association with the merger between exxon and mobil 748 million pretax
525 million aftertax 1406 million pretax 920 million aftertax and
625 million pretax 469 million aftertax of costs were recorded as
mergerrelated expenses in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively charges included
separation expenses related to workforce reductions approximately 8000
employees at yearend 2001 plus implementation and merger closing costs the
separation reserve balance at yearend 2001 of approximately 197 million is
expected to be expended in 2002 mergerrelated expenses are expected to grow to
approximately 29 billion pretax on a cumulative basis by the end of 2002
pretax operating synergies associated with the merger which are on track with
expectations including cost savings efficiency gains and revenue
enhancements are expected to reach approximately 7 billion per year by 2002

     in the first quarter of 1999 the corporation recorded a 120 million
aftertax charge for the nonmerger related reorganization of japanese
downstream operations in its whollyowned esso sekiyu kk and 501 percent
owned general sekiyu kk affiliates the reorganization resulted in the
reduction of approximately 700 administrative financial logistics and
marketing service employee positions the japanese affiliates recorded a
combined charge of 216 million beforetax to selling general and
administrative expenses for the employee related costs substantially all cash
expenditures anticipated in the restructuring provision were paid in 1999
general sekiyu also recorded a 211 million beforetax charge to depreciation
and depletion for the writeoff of costs associated with the cancellation of a
power plant project at the kawasaki terminal workforce reduction savings
associated with this reorganization are approximately 50 million per year

site restoration and other environmental costs

over the years the corporation has accrued provisions for estimated site
restoration costs to be incurred at the end of the operating life of certain of
its facilities and properties in addition the corporation accrues provisions
for environmental liabilities in the many countries in which it does business
when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently
owned or previously disposed

     the corporation has accrued provisions for probable environmental
remediation obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where
exxonmobil has been identified as one of the potentially responsible parties by
the us environmental protection agency the involvement of other financially
responsible companies at these multiparty sites mitigates exxonmobils actual
joint and several liability exposure at present no individual site is expected
to have losses material to exxonmobils operations financial condition or
liquidity

     charges made against income for site restoration and environmental
liabilities were 371 million in 2001 311 million in 2000 and 219 million in
1999 at the end of 2001 accumulated site restoration and environmental
provisions after reduction for amounts paid amounted to 37 billion
exxonmobil believes that any cost in excess of the amounts already provided for
in the financial statements would not have a materially adverse effect upon the
corporations operations financial condition or liquidity

     exxonmobils worldwide environmental costs in 2001 totaled 1782 million
of which 505 million were capital expenditures and 1277 million were
operating costs including the 371 million of site restoration and
environmental provisions noted above these costs were mostly associated with
air and water conservation total costs for such activities are expected to
increase to about 25 billion in both 2002 and 2003 with capital expenditures
representing about 50 percent of the total the projected increase is primarily
for capital projects to implement refining technology to manufacture lowsulfur
motor fuels in many parts of the world

taxes

income excise and all other taxes and duties totaled 666 billion in 2001 a
decrease of 18 billion or 3 percent from 2000 income tax expense both
current and deferred was 90 billion compared to 111 billion in 2000
reflecting lower pretax income in 2001 the effective tax rate of 393 percent
in 2001 compared to 424 percent in 2000 benefiting from a higher level of
favorably resolved taxrelated issues excise and all other taxes and duties
were 576 billion

     income excise and all other taxes and duties totaled 684 billion in
2000 an increase of 69 billion or 11 percent from 1999 income tax expense
both current and deferred was 111 billion compared to 32 billion in 1999
reflecting higher pretax income in 2000 the effective tax rate increased from
318 percent in 1999 to 424 percent in 2000 as a result of a larger share of
total earnings coming from the more highly taxed nonus upstream segment and
lower benefits from resolution of taxrelated issues excise and all other taxes
and duties decreased 10 billion to 573 billion

market risks inflation and other uncertainties

in the past crude natural gas petroleum product and chemical prices have
fluctuated widely in response to changing market forces the impacts of these
price fluctuations on earnings from upstream operations downstream operations
and chemicals operations have been varied tending at times to be offsetting
nonetheless the global energy markets can give rise to extended periods in
which market conditions are adverse to one or more of the corporations
businesses such conditions along with the capital intensive nature of the
industry and very long lead times associated with many of our projects
underscore the importance of maintaining a strong financial position management
views the corporations financial strength including the aaa and aaa ratings of
its longterm debt securities by standard and poors and moodys as a
competitive advantage

     although price levels of crude oil and natural gas will occasionally spike
upwards or drop precipitously industry prices over the long term will continue
to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals accordingly the
corporation tests the viability of its oil and gas operations based on longterm
price projections the corporations assessment is that its operations will
continue to be successful in a variety of market conditions this is the outcome
of disciplined investment and asset management programs investment
opportunities are tested against a variety of market conditions including low
price scenarios as a result investments that would succeed only in highly
favorable price environments are screened out of the investment plan

     the corporation has had an active asset management program in which
underperforming assets are either improved to acceptable levels or considered
for divestment the asset management program involves a disciplined regular
review to ensure that all assets are contributing to the corporations strategic
and financial objectives the result has been the creation of a very efficient
capital base and has meant that the corporation has seldom been required to
writedown the carrying value of assets even during periods of low commodity
prices

risk management

the corporations size geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the
upstream downstream and chemicals businesses mitigate the corporations risk
from changes in interest rates currency rates and commodity prices the
corporation relies on these operating attributes and strengths to reduce
enterprisewide risk as a result the corporation makes limited use of
derivatives to offset exposures arising from existing transactions

     the corporation does not trade in derivatives nor does it use derivatives
with leverage features the corporation maintains a system of controls that
includes a policy covering the authorization reporting and monitoring of
derivative activity the corporations derivative activities pose no material
credit or market risks to exxonmobils operations financial condition or
liquidity interest rate foreign exchange rate and commodity price exposures
arising from derivative contracts undertaken in accordance with the
corporations policies have not been significant

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations

     the fair value of derivatives outstanding and recorded on the balance sheet
at december 31 2001 was 50 million beforetax this is the amount that the
corporation would have had to pay to third parties if these derivatives had been
settled at yearend these derivative fair values were substantially offset by
the fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged during 2001 the
corporation recognized a beforetax gain of 23 million related to derivative
activity this gain included the offsetting amounts from the changes in fair
value of the items being hedged by the derivatives the fair value of
derivatives outstanding at yearend and gains recognized during the year are
immaterial in relation to the corporations yearend cash balance of 65
billion total assets of 1432 billion or net income for the year of 153
billion

debtrelated instruments

the corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result
of its shortterm debt and longterm debt carrying floating interest rates the
corporation makes limited use of interest rate swap agreements to adjust the
ratio of fixed and floating rates in the debt portfolio the impact of a 100
basis point change in interest rates affecting the corporations debt would not
be material to earnings cash flow or fair value

foreign currency exchange rate instruments

the corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to
foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales expenses
financing and investment transactions the impacts of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates on exxonmobils geographically diverse operations are
varied and often offsetting in amount the corporation makes limited use of
currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of adverse foreign currency
movements related to certain foreign currency debt obligations exposure from
market rate fluctuations related to these contracts is not material aggregate
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses included in net income are
discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

commodity instruments

the corporation makes limited use of commodity forwards swaps and futures
contracts of short duration to mitigate the risk of unfavorable price movements
on certain crude natural gas and petroleum product purchases and sales
commodity price exposure related to these contracts is not material

inflation and other uncertainties

the general rate of inflation in most major countries of operation has been
relatively low in recent years and the associated impact on operating costs has
been countered by cost reductions from efficiency and productivity improvements

     the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates
throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to
time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations such
as forced divestiture of assets restrictions on production imports and
exports price controls tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation
of property cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations both
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the corporation
vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable

recently issued statements
of financial accounting standards

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statements of
financial accounting standards no 141 fas 141 business combinations and
no 142 fas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets under fas 141 the
pooling of interests method of accounting is no longer permitted and the
purchase method must be used for business combinations initiated after june 30
2001 under fas 142 which will be effective for the corporation beginning
january 1 2002 goodwill and certain intangibles will no longer be amortized
but will be subject to annual impairment tests the effect of adoption of the
new standards on the corporations financial statements will be negligible

     in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement
of financial accounting standards no 143 fas 143 accounting for asset
retirement obligations fas 143 is required to be adopted by the corporation no
later than january 1 2003 and its primary impact will be to change the method
of accruing for upstream site restoration costs these costs are currently
accrued ratably over the productive lives of the assets at the end of 2001 the
cumulative amount accrued under this policy was approximately 32 billion
under fas 143 the fair value of asset retirement obligations will be recorded
as liabilities when they are incurred which are typically at the time the
assets are installed amounts recorded for the related assets will be increased
by the amount of these obligations over time the liabilities will be accrued
for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs will be
depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets the corporation is
evaluating the impact of adopting fas 143

     in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement
of financial accounting standards no 144 fas 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets fas 144 is required to be adopted
prospectively by the corporation no later than january 1 2002 fas 144
supercedes previous guidance related to the impairment or disposal of longlived
assets for longlived assets to be held and used it resolves certain
implementation issues of the former standards but retains the basic
requirements of recognition and measurement of impairment losses for longlived
assets to be disposed of by sale it broadens the definition of those disposals
that should be reported separately as discontinued operations there is no
impact on the corporation of adopting fas 144 except that future sales of
longlived assets may be required to be presented as discontinued operations
which would be a different presentation than under previous accounting
standards

critical accounting policies

the corporations accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its
straightforward business model involving the extracting refining and marketing
of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbonbased products the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles
gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following summary provides
further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in

principles of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of those significant
subsidiaries that the corporation controls they also include the corporations
undivided interests in upstream assets and liabilities amounts representing the
corporations percentage interest in the underlying net assets of other
significant affiliates that it does not control but exercises significant
influence are included in investments and advances the corporations share
of the net income of these companies is included in the consolidated statement
of income caption earnings from equity interests and other revenue the
accounting for these nonconsolidated companies is referred to as the equity
method of accounting

     additional disclosures of summary balance sheet and income information for
those subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method of accounting can be
found in note 8 on page 41 the corporation believes this to be important
information necessary to a full understanding of the corporations financial
statements

     investments in companies that are partially owned by the corporation are
integral to the corporations operations in some cases they serve to balance
worldwide risks and in others they provide the only available means of entry
into a particular market or area of interest the other parties who also have an
equity interest in these companies are either independent third parties or host
governments that share in the business results according to their percentage
ownership the corporation does not invest in these companies in order to remove
liabilities from its balance sheet in fact the corporation has long been on
record supporting an alternative accounting method that would require each
investor to consolidate its percentage share of all assets and liabilities in
these partially owned companies rather than only the percentage in the net
equity this method of accounting for investments in partially owned companies
is not permitted by gaap except where the investments are in the undivided
interests in upstream assets and liabilities however for purposes of
calculating return on average capital employed which is not covered by gaap
standards the corporation includes its share of debt of these partially owned
companies in the determination of average capital employed

revenue recognition

revenues associated with sales of crude oil natural gas petroleum and chemical
products and all other items are recorded when title passes to the customer

     the corporation does not engage in arrangements whereby the corporation has
ongoing relationships with its buyers that require it to repurchase its products
or provide buyers with the right of return as a result the recognition of
revenues is straightforward

derivative instruments

as discussed on page 29 the corporation makes limited use of derivatives
derivative instruments are not held for trading purposes nor do they have
leverage features the corporations size geographic diversity and the
complementary nature of the upstream downstream and chemicals businesses
mitigate the corporations risk from changes in interest rates currency rates
and commodity prices reducing the corporations need for derivatives to manage
business risk

     because of their limited use accounting policies for derivatives do not
impact information that is significant or critical to an understanding of the
corporations financial condition and results of operations

inventories

crude oil products and merchandise are carried at the lower of current market
value or cost generally determined under the lastin firstout method  lifo

     there are other acceptable methods of accounting for inventory such as
firstin firstout or average cost the corporation uses the lifo method
because it charges each sale with the cost of the most recently purchased
inventory as such the profit recognized on these sales is based on the latest
cost structure and generally results in a better matching of costs and revenues

property plant and equipment

the corporations exploration and production activities are accounted for under
the successful efforts method depreciation depletion and amortization based
on cost less estimated salvage value of the asset are primarily determined
under either the unitofproduction method or the straightline method
unitofproduction rates are based on oil gas and mineral reserves estimated to
be recoverable from existing facilities the straightline method is based on
estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration the service
lives of refinery and chemicals components generally extend to 25 and 20 years
respectively and reflect the corporations longterm commitment to effective
asset optimization

     under the successful efforts method costs are accumulated on a
fieldbyfield basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry
holes being expensed as incurred exploratory wells that find oil and gas in an
area requiring a major capital expenditure before production can begin are
evaluated annually to ensure that commercial quantities of reserves have been
found or that additional exploration work is underway or planned costs of
productive wells and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on the
unitofproduction method for each field the corporation uses this accounting
policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely
accounting of the success or failure of the corporations exploration and
production activities if the full cost method were used all costs would be
capitalized and depreciated on a countrybycountry basis the capitalized costs
would be subject to an impairment test by country the full cost method would
tend to delay the expense recognition of unsuccessful projects

     oil gas and other properties held and used by the corporation are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amounts may not be recoverable the corporation estimates the future
undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability
of carrying amounts in general analyses are based on proved reserves except
in circumstances where it is probable that additional resources will be
developed and contribute to cash flows in the future

     evaluations of oil and gas reserves are important to the effective
management of upstream assets they are integral to making investment decisions
about oil and gas properties such as whether develop

operations

ment should proceed or enhanced recovery methods should be undertaken proved
oil and gas reserve quantities are also used as the basis of calculating the
unitofproduction rates for depreciation and evaluating for impairment these
reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil natural gas and natural gas
liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
economic and operating conditions ie prices and costs as of the date the
estimate is made the estimation of reserves is an ongoing process based on
rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of well information such as
flow rates and reservoir pressure declines

     supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production
activities can be found on pages 57 to 61 included in that section on page 60
is information on canadian tar sands proven reserves this information is shown
separately from the conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves for
internal management purposes the corporation does not view these reserves
separately but instead considers them and their development as an integral part
of total upstream operations refining tar sands reserves produces the same
petroleum products that are produced from refining conventional oil and gas
reserves however us securities and exchange commission regulations define
these tar sands reserves as mining reserves and not a part of conventional oil
and gas reserves

site restoration and environmental conservation costs

site restoration costs that may be incurred by the corporation at the end of the
operating life of certain of its facilities and properties are accrued ratably
over the assets productive life liabilities for environmental conservation are
recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts
can be reasonably estimated

     the necessity of recording liabilities for these costs is prescribed by
gaap estimating the probability of whether obligations have been incurred and
the amounts that should be recorded requires significant management judgment
this judgment is based on extensive cost and engineering studies using the
latest available technology

foreign currency translation

the functional currency for translating the accounts of the majority of
downstream and chemicals operations outside the us is the local currency
local currency is also used for upstream operations that are relatively
selfcontained and integrated within a particular country the us dollar is
used for operations in highly inflationary economies and certain other
countries

     the method of translating the foreign currency financial statements of the
corporations international subsidiaries into us dollars is prescribed by gaap
under these principles it is necessary to select the functional currency of
these subsidiaries the functional currency is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the subsidiary operates management selects the
functional currency after evaluating this economic environment downstream and
chemicals operations normally use the local currency except in highly
inflationary countries primarily latin america as well as in singapore which
uses the us dollar because it predominantly sells into the us dollar export
market upstream operations also use the local currency as the functional
currency except where crude and natural gas production is predominantly sold in
the export market in us dollars these operations which use the us dollar
as their functional currency are in malaysia indonesia nigeria equatorial
guinea and the middle east countries

litigation and other contingencies

claims for substantial amounts have been made against exxonmobil and certain of
its consolidated subsidiaries in pending lawsuits and tax disputes these are
summarized on page 27 with a more extensive discussion included in note 17 on
page 51

     the general guidance provided by gaap requires that liabilities for
contingencies should be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred before the date of the balance sheet and that the amount can be
reasonably estimated significant management judgment is required to comply with
this guidance and it includes management reviews with the corporations
attorneys taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and
circumstances

notes to consolidated financial statements

the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the supporting and
supplemental material are the responsibility of the management of exxon mobil
corporation

the corporations principal business is energy involving the worldwide
exploration production transportation and sale of crude oil and natural gas
upstream and the manufacture transportation and sale of petroleum products
downstream the corporation is also a major worldwide manufacturer and
marketer of petrochemicals and participates in coal and minerals mining and
electric power generation

     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect
the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ
from these estimates

1 summary of accounting policies

principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of those significant subsidiaries owned directly or indirectly with
more than 50 percent of the voting rights held by the corporation and for which
other shareholders do not possess the right to participate in significant
management decisions they also include the corporations share of the undivided
interest in upstream assets and liabilities amounts representing the
corporations percentage interest in the underlying net assets of other
significant subsidiaries and less than majority owned companies in which a
significant equity ownership interest is held are included in investments and
advances the corporations share of the net income of these companies is
included in the consolidated statement of income caption earnings from equity
interests and other revenue

     investments in other companies none of which is significant are generally
included in investments and advances at cost or less dividends from these
companies are included in income as received

revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil natural gas
petroleum and chemical products and all other items are recorded when title
passes to the customer

     revenues from the production of natural gas properties in which the
corporation has an interest with the other producers are recognized on the basis
of the companys net working interest differences between actual production and
net working interest volumes are not significant

derivative instruments the corporation makes limited use of derivatives
derivative instruments are not held for trading purposes nor do they have
leverage features when the corporation does enter into derivative transactions
it is to offset exposures associated with interest rates foreign currency
exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices the gains and losses resulting from the
changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in income except when
the instruments are designated as hedging the currency exposure of net
investments in foreign subsidiaries in which case they are recorded in the
cumulative foreign exchange translation account as part of shareholders equity

     the gains and losses on derivative instruments that are designated as fair
value hedges ie those hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of
an asset or a liability or the changes in the fair value of a firm commitment
are offset by the gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the hedged
items which are also recognized in income most of these designated hedges are
entered into at the same time that the hedged items are transacted they are
fully effective and in combination with the offsetting hedged items they result
in no net impact on income in some situations the corporation has chosen not
to designate certain immaterial derivatives used for hedging economic exposure
as hedges for accounting purposes due to the excessive administrative effort
that would be required to account for these items as hedging transactions these
derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and the gains and
losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in income all
derivatives activity is immaterial

inventories crude oil products and merchandise inventories are carried at the
lower of current market value or cost generally determined under the lastin
firstout method  lifo costs include applicable purchase costs and operating
expenses but not general and administrative expenses or research and development
costs inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less

property plant and equipment depreciation depletion and amortization based
on cost less estimated salvage value of the asset are primarily determined
under either the unitofproduction method or the straightline method
unitofproduction rates are based on oil gas and other mineral reserves
estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities the straightline method
of depreciation is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence
into consideration

     maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred major renewals and
improvements are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired

     the corporations upstream activities are accounted for under the
successful efforts method under this method costs of productive wells and
development dry holes both tangible and intangible as well as productive
acreage are capitalized and amortized on the unitofproduction method costs of
that portion of undeveloped acreage likely to be unproductive based largely on
historical experience are amortized over the period of exploration other
exploratory expenditures including geophysical costs other dry hole costs and
annual lease rentals are expensed as incurred exploratory wells that find oil
and gas in an area requiring a major capital expenditure before production can
begin are evaluated annually to assure that commercial quantities of reserves
have been found or that additional exploration work is underway or planned
exploratory well costs not meeting either of these tests are charged to expense

     oil gas and other properties held and used by the corporation are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amounts may not be recoverable the corporation estimates the future
undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability
of carrying amounts in general analyses are based on proved reserves except
in circumstances where it is probable that additional resources will be
developed and contribute to cash flows in the future

site restoration and environmental conservation costs site restoration costs
that may be incurred by the corporation at the end of the operating life of
certain of its facilities and properties are reserved ratably over the assets
productive life

                                       38

page

     liabilities for environmental conservation are recorded when it is probable
that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated
these liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties and
projected cash expenditures are not discounted

foreign currency translation the functional currency for translating the
accounts of the majority of downstream and chemical operations outside the us
is the local currency local currency is also used for upstream operations that
are relatively selfcontained and integrated within a particular country such
as in canada the united kingdom norway and continental europe the us dollar
is used for operations in highly inflationary economies in singapore which is
predominantly export oriented and for some upstream operations primarily in
malaysia indonesia nigeria equatorial guinea and the middle east countries
for all operations gains or losses on remeasuring foreign currency transactions
into functional currency are included in income

2 extraordinary item and accounting change

net income for 2001 included net aftertax gains from asset management
activities in the chemicals segment and regulatory required asset divestitures
in the amount of 215 million including an income tax credit of 21 million
or 003 per common share net income for 2000 included net aftertax gains from
regulatory required asset divestitures in the amount of 1730 million net 308
million of income taxes or 025 per common share these net aftertax gains
were reported as extraordinary items according to accounting requirements for
business combinations accounted for as pooling of interests

     as of january 1 2001 exxonmobil adopted financial accounting standards
board statement no 133 fas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities as amended by statements no 137 and 138 this statement
requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in
the financial statements and be measured at fair value since the corporation
makes limited use of derivatives the effect of adoption of fas 133 on the
corporations operations or financial condition was negligible

3 merger of exxon corporation and mobil corporation

on november 30 1999 a whollyowned subsidiary of exxon corporation exxon
merged with mobil corporation mobil so that mobil became a whollyowned
subsidiary of exxon the merger at the same time exxon changed its name to
exxon mobil corporation exxonmobil under the terms of the agreement
approximately 10 billion shares of exxonmobil common stock were issued in
exchange for all the outstanding shares of mobil common stock based upon an
exchange ratio of 132015 following the exchange former shareholders of exxon
owned approximately 70 percent of the corporation while former mobil
shareholders owned approximately 30 percent of the corporation each outstanding
share of mobil preferred stock was converted into one share of a new class of
exxonmobil preferred stock

     as a result of the merger the accounts of certain downstream and chemicals
operations jointly controlled by the combining companies have been included in
the consolidated financial statements these operations were previously
accounted for by exxon and mobil as separate companies using the equity method
of accounting

     the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests accordingly the
consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the merger with
all periods presented as if exxon and mobil had always been combined certain
reclassifications have been made to conform the presentation of exxon and mobil

     as a condition of the approval of the merger the us federal trade
commission and the european commission required that certain property 
primarily downstream pipeline and natural gas distribution assets  be
divested the carrying value of these assets was approximately 3 billion and
net aftertax gains of 40 million and 1730 million were reported as
extraordinary items in 2001 and 2000 respectively the divested properties
historically earned approximately 200 million per year

4 merger expenses and reorganization reserves

     in association with the merger 748 million pretax 525 million
aftertax 1406 million pretax 920 million aftertax and 625 million
pretax 469 million aftertax of costs were recorded as mergerrelated
expenses in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively these cumulative charges of
2779 million included separation expenses of approximately 1345 million
related to workforce reductions approximately 8000 employees at yearend
2001 plus implementation costs and merger closing costs the separation
reserve balance at yearend 2001 of approximately 197 million is expected to
be expended in 2002

     in the first quarter of 1999 the corporation recorded a 120 million
aftertax charge for the nonmerger related reorganization of japanese
downstream operations in its whollyowned esso sekiyu kk and 501 percent
owned general sekiyu kk affiliates the reorganization resulted in the
reduction of approximately 700 administrative financial logistics and
marketing service employee positions the japanese affiliates recorded a
combined charge of 216 million beforetax to selling general and
administrative expenses for the employee related costs substantially all cash
expenditures anticipated in the restructuring provision have been paid as of the
end of 1999 general sekiyu also recorded a 211 million beforetax charge to
depreciation and depletion for the writeoff of costs associated with the
cancellation of a power plant project at the kawasaki terminal

     the following table summarizes the activity in the reorganization reserves

years

14 financial instruments and derivatives

the fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various
market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate longterm debt is the
only category of financial instruments whose fair value differs materially from
the recorded book value the estimated fair value of total longterm debt
including capitalized lease obligations at december 31 2001 and 2000 was 79
billion and 80 billion respectively as compared to recorded book values of
71 billion and 73 billion

     the corporations size geographic diversity and the complementary nature
of the upstream downstream and chemicals businesses mitigate the corporations
risk from changes in interest rates currency rates and commodity prices the
corporation relies on these operating attributes and strengths to reduce
enterprisewide risk as a result the corporation makes limited use of
derivatives to offset exposures arising from existing transactions

     the corporation does not trade in derivatives nor does it use derivatives
with leveraged features the corporation maintains a system of controls that
includes a policy covering the authorization reporting and monitoring of
derivative activity the corporations derivative activities pose no material
credit or market risks to exxonmobils operations financial condition or
liquidity interest rate foreign exchange rate and commodity price exposures
arising from derivative contracts undertaken in accordance with the
corporations policies have not been significant

     the fair value of derivatives outstanding and recorded on the balance sheet
at december 31 2001 was 50 million beforetax this is the amount that the
corporation would have had to pay to third parties if these derivatives had been
settled at yearend these derivative fair values were substantially offset by
the fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged during 2001 the
corporation recognized a beforetax gain of 23 million related to derivative
activity this gain included the offsetting amounts from the changes in fair
value of the items being hedged by the derivatives

15 longterm debt

at december 31 2001 longterm debt consisted of 6465 million due in us
dollars and 634 million representing the us dollar equivalent at yearend
exchange rates of amounts payable in foreign currencies these amounts exclude
that portion of longterm debt totaling 339 million which matures within one

maturing together with sinking fund payments required in each of the four
years after december 31 2002 in millions of dollars are 2003  880 2004 
2176 2005  328 and 2006  114 certain of the borrowings described may
from time to time be assigned to other exxonmobil affiliates at december 31
2001 the corporations unused longterm credit lines were not material

the 1993 incentive program provides for grants of stock options stock
appreciation rights sars restricted stock and other forms of award awards
may be granted over a 10year period to eligible employees of the corporation
and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned the number of shares of stock
which may be awarded each year under the 1993 incentive program may not exceed
seven tenths of one percent 07 of the total number of shares of common stock
of the corporation outstanding excluding shares held by the corporation on
december 31 of the preceding year if the total number of shares effectively
granted in any year is less than the maximum number of shares allowable the
balance may be carried over thereafter outstanding awards are subject to
certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument

     options and sars may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of
market value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years most of
the options and sars normally first become exercisable one year following the
date of grant

     on the closing of the merger on november 30 1999 outstanding options and
sars granted by mobil under its 1995 incentive compensation and stock ownership
plan and prior plans were assumed by exxonmobil and converted into rights to
acquire exxonmobil common stock with adjustments to reflect the exchange ratio
no further awards may be granted under the former mobil plans

     shares available for granting under the 1993 incentive program were 133115
thousand at the beginning of 2001 and 98668 thousand at the end of 2001 at
december 31 2000 and 2001 respectively 2438 thousand and 2559 thousand
shares of restricted common stock were outstanding

     statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for
stockbased compensation was implemented in january 1996 as permitted by the
standard exxonmobil retained its prior method of accounting for stock
compensation if the provisions of statement no 123 had been adopted net

been reduced by 285 million or 004 per share in 2001 296 million or 004
per share in 2000 and 149 million or 002 per share in 1999 for the
exxonmobil plan the average fair value of each option granted during 2001 2000
and 1999 was 689 1018 and 985 respectively the fair value was estimated
at the grant date using an optionpricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions for 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively riskfree interest
rates of 46 percent 55 percent and 62 percent expected life of 6 years for
all years volatility of 16 percent 16 percent and 15 percent and a dividend
yield of 25 percent 20 percent and 21 percent for the mobil plans the
average fair value of each mobil option granted during 1999 was 851 the fair
value was estimated at the grant date using an optionpricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions for 1999 riskfree interest rate of 52
percent expected life of 5 years volatility of 20 percent and a dividend yield
of 27 percent

17 litigation and other contingencies

a number of lawsuits including class actions were brought in various courts
against exxon mobil corporation and certain of its subsidiaries relating to the
accidental release of crude oil from the tanker exxon valdez in 1989 the vast
majority of the claims have been resolved leaving a few compensatory damages
cases to be tried all of the punitive damage claims were consolidated in the
civil trial that began in may 1994

     in that trial on september 24 1996 the united states district court for
the district of alaska entered a judgment in the amount of 5058 billion the
district court awarded approximately 196 million in compensatory damages to
fisher plaintiffs 38 million in prejudgment interest on the compensatory
damages and 5 billion in punitive damages to a class composed of all persons
and entities who asserted claims for punitive damages from the corporation as a
result of the exxon valdez grounding the district court also ordered that these
awards shall bear interest from and after entry of the judgment the district
court stayed execution on the judgment pending appeal based on a 675 billion
letter of credit posted by the corporation exxonmobil appealed the judgment on
november 7 2001 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
vacated the punitive damage award as being excessive under the constitution and
remanded the case to the district court for it to determine the amount of the
punitive damage award consistent with the ninth circuits holding the ninth
circuit upheld the compensatory damage award which has been paid the letter of
credit was terminated on february 1 2002

     on january 29 1997 a settlement agreement was concluded resolving all
remaining matters between the corporation and various insurers arising from the
valdez accident under terms of this settlement exxonmobil received 480
million final income statement recognition of this settlement continues to be
deferred in view of uncertainty regarding the ultimate cost to the corporation
of the valdez accident

     the ultimate cost to exxonmobil from the lawsuits arising from the exxon
valdez grounding is not possible to predict and may not be resolved for a number
of years

     under the october 8 1991 civil agreement and consent decrees with the
us and alaska governments the corporation made the final payment of 70
million in the third quarter of 2001 this payment along with prior payments
was charged against the provision that was previously established to cover the
costs of the settlement

     a dispute with a dutch affiliate concerning an overlift of natural gas by a
german affiliate was resolved by payments by the german affiliate pursuant to an
arbitration award the german affiliate had paid royalties on the excess gas and
recovered the royalties in 2001 the only substantive issue remaining is the
taxes payable on the final compensation for the overlift resolution of this
issue will not have a materially adverse effect upon the corporations
operations or financial condition

     on december 19 2000 a jury in montgomery county alabama returned a
verdict against the corporation in a contract dispute over royalties in the
amount of 8769 million in compensatory damages and 342 billion in punitive
damages in the case of exxon corporation v state of alabama et al the verdict
was upheld by the trial court on may 4 2001 exxonmobil has appealed the
judgment and believes that it should be set aside or substantially reduced on
factual and constitutional grounds the ultimate outcome is not expected to have
a materially adverse effect upon the corporations operations or financial
condition

     on may 22 2001 a state court jury in new orleans louisiana returned a
verdict against the corporation and three other entities in a case brought by a
landowner claiming damage to his property the property had been leased by the
landowner to a company that performed pipe cleaning and storage services for
customers including the corporation the jury awarded the plaintiff 56 million
in compensatory damages 90 percent to be paid by the corporation and 1
billion in punitive damages all to be paid by the corporation the damage
related to the presence of naturally occurring radioactive material norm on
the site resulting from pipe cleaning operations the award has been upheld at
the trial court exxonmobil will appeal the judgment to the louisiana fourth
circuit court of appeals and believes that the judgment should be set aside or
substantially reduced on factual and constitutional grounds the ultimate
outcome is not expected to have a materially adverse effect upon the
corporations operations or financial condition

     the us tax court has decided the issue with respect to the pricing of
crude oil purchased from saudi arabia for the years 19791981 in favor of the
corporation this decision is subject to appeal certain other issues for the
years 19791993 remain pending before the tax court the ultimate resolution of
these issues is not expected to have a materially adverse effect upon the
corporations operations or financial condition

     claims for substantial amounts have been made against exxonmobil and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in other pending lawsuits the outcome
of which is not expected to have a materially adverse effect upon the
corporations operations or financial condition

     the corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were
contingently liable at december 31 2001 for 3921 million primarily relating
to guarantees for notes loans and performance under contracts this included
672 million representing guarantees of nonus excise taxes and customs duties
of other companies entered into as a normal business practice under reciprocal
arrangements also included in this amount were guarantees by consolidated
affiliates of 1641 million representing exxonmobils share of obligations of
certain equity companies

     additionally the corporation and its affiliates have numerous longterm
sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities all of
which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the
corporations operations or financial condition the present value of
unconditional purchase obligations was 1296 million at december 31 2001 on
an undiscounted basis including imputed interest of 733 million these
commitments totaled 2029 million unconditional purchase obligations as
defined by accounting standards are those longterm commitments that are
noncancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions and that third
parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the
contracted goods or services

     the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates
throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to
time in varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations such
as forced divestiture of assets restrictions on production imports and
exports price controls tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation
of property cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations both
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the corporation
vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable

the preceding data conform with current accounting standards that specify use of
a discount rate at which postretirement liabilities could be effectively
settled the discount rate for calculating yearend postretirement liabilities
is based on the yearend rate of interest on high quality bonds the return on
the annuity funds actual portfolio of assets has historically been higher than
bonds as the majority of pension assets are invested in equities the actual
rate earned in the us over the past decade has been 12 percent all funded
us plans are fully funded in 2001 under the standards set by the department of
labor and the internal revenue service the corporation will continue to make
contributions as necessary to maintain the fully funded status of these plans
according to those standards certain smaller us plans and a number of
nonus plans are not funded because local tax conventions and regulatory
practices do not encourage funding of these plans book reserves have been
established for these plans to provide for future benefit payments all defined
benefit pension obligations regardless of the funding status of the underlying
plans are fully supported by the financial strength of the corporation or the
respective sponsoring affiliate

the amounts shown for net capitalized costs of consolidated subsidiaries are
5212 million less at yearend 2001 and 4852 million less at yearend 2000
than the amounts reported as investments in property plant and equipment for
the upstream in note 10 this is due to the exclusion from capitalized costs of
certain transportation and research assets and assets relating to the tar sands
and lng operations and to the inclusion of accumulated provisions for site
restoration costs all as required in statement of financial accounting
standards no 19

     the amounts reported as costs incurred include both capitalized costs and
costs charged to expense during the year total worldwide costs incurred in 2001
were 7803 million up 1740 million from 2000 due primarily to higher
development costs 2000 costs were 6063 million down 1696 million from
1999 due primarily to lower development costs

oil and gas reserves

the following information describes changes during the years and balances of
proved oil and gas reserves at yearend 1999 2000 and 2001

     the definitions used are in accordance with applicable securities and
exchange commission regulations

     proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil
natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from
known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions ie prices
and costs as of the date the estimate is made prices include consideration of
changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not on
escalations based upon future conditions in some cases substantial new
investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to
recover these proved reserves

     proved reserves include 100 percent of each majority owned affiliates
participation in proved reserves and exxonmobils ownership percentage of the
proved reserves of equity companies but exclude royalties and quantities due
others gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be
removed from the gas on leases at field facilities and at gas processing
plants these liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and
natural gas liquids

supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities

     net proved developed reserves are those volumes which are expected to be
recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods
undeveloped reserves are those volumes which are expected to be recovered as a
result of future investments to drill new wells to recomplete existing wells
andor to install facilities to collect and deliver the production from existing
and future wells

     reserves attributable to certain oil and gas discoveries were not
considered proved as of yearend 2001 due to geological technological or
economic uncertainties and therefore are not included in the tabulation

     crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas production quantities
shown are the net volumes withdrawn from exxonmobils oil and gas reserves the
natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of gas delivered for sale by
the producing function as reported on page 62 due to volumes consumed or flared
and inventory changes such quantities amounted to approximately 391 billion
cubic feet in 1999 392 billion cubic feet in 2000 and 406 billion cubic feet in
2001

information on canadian tar sands proven reserves not included above

in addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves exxonmobil
has significant interests in proven tar sands reserves in canada associated with
the syncrude project for internal management purposes exxonmobil views these
reserves and their development as an integral part of total upstream operations
however us securities and exchange commission regulations define these
reserves as mining related and not a part of conventional oil and gas reserves

     the tar sands reserves are not considered in the standardized measure of
discounted future cash flows for conventional oil and gas reserves which is
found on page 61

standardized measure of discounted future cash flows

as required by the financial accounting standards board the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed by applying yearend
prices costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10 percent to
net proved reserves the corporation believes the standardized measure is not
meaningful and may be misleading due to a number of factors including
significant variability in cash flows due to changes in yearend prices

factors affecting future results


competitive factors the energy and petrochemical industries are highly
competitive there is competition within the industries and also with other
industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and
individual consumers the corporation competes with other firms in the sale or
purchase of various goods or services in many national and international
markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and
appropriate for such purposes

political factors the operations and earnings of the corporation and its
affiliates throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected
from time to time in varying degree by political instability and by other
political developments and laws and regulations such as forced divestiture of

                                       1
page

assets restrictions on production imports and exports price controls tax
increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of property cancellation
of contract rights and environmental regulations both the likelihood of such
occurrences and their overall effect upon the corporation vary greatly from
country to country and are not predictable

industry and economic factors the operations and earnings of the corporation
and its affiliates throughout the world are also affected by local regional
and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil natural
gas petroleum products petrochemicals and other exxonmobil products these
events or conditions are generally not predictable and include among other
things the development of new supply sources supply disruptions weather
international political events technological advances changes in
demographics and consumer preferences and the competitiveness of alternative
energy sources or product substitutes

project factors the advancement cost and results of particular exxonmobil
projects also depend on the outcome of negotiations with partners
governments suppliers customers or others changes in operating conditions
or costs and the occurrence of unforeseen technical difficulties

mergerrelated factors realization of the benefits of the merger will depend
among other things upon managements ability to integrate the businesses of
exxon and mobil successfully and on schedule future results could also be
affected by the diversion of managements focus and resources from other
strategic opportunities during the merger integration process

market risk factors see also page 23 and 24 of the financial section of this
report for discussion of the impact of market risks inflation and other
uncertainties

  projections estimates and descriptions of exxonmobils plans and objectives
included or incorporated in items 1 2 7 and 7a of this report are forward

exchange act industry guide 2 is contained in the financial section of this
report in note 10 which note appears on page 36 and on pages 51 through 55
and 57

information with regard to oil and gas producing activities follows


1 net reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids millions of barrels and
   natural gas billions of cubic feet at yearend 2000

  estimated proved reserves are shown on pages 53 and 54 of the financial
section of this report no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event
has occurred since december 31 2000 that would cause a significant change in
the estimated proved reserves as of that date for information on the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved
oil and gas reserves see page 55 of the financial section of this report

2 estimates of total net proved oil and gas reserves filed with other federal
   agencies

  during 2000 exxonmobil filed proved reserves estimates with the us
department of energy on forms eia23 and eia28 the information is consistent
with the exxonmobil 1999 annual report to shareholders with the exception of
eia23 which covered total oil and gas reserves from

plant liquids the differences between the oil reserves and gas reserves
reported on eia23 and those reported in the 1999 annual report exceed five
percent

3 average sales prices and production costs per unit of production

  reference is made to page 51 of the financial section of this report
average sales prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from our
own production as the divisor average production costs have been computed by
using net production quantities for the divisor the volumes of crude oil and
natural gas liquids ngl production used for this computation are shown in
the reserves table on page 53 of the financial section of this report the net
production volumes of natural gas available for sale by the producing function
used in this calculation are shown on page 57 of the financial section of this
report the volumes of natural gas were converted to oilequivalent barrels
based on a conversion factor of six thousand cubic feet per barrel

  exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are
typically governed by production sharing contracts pscs with the national
oil company the national oil company holds the underlying oil prospecting
license opl and any resulting oil mining lease oml the terms of the pscs
are generally 30 years including a tenyear exploration period sixyear
initial exploration phase plus a fouryear optional period with no required
relinquishment after the initial phase a 50 percent relinquishment
requirement after the second phase and a 20year production period that may be
extended

  some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by joint ventures
with indigenous companies as direct participants in an opl opls in deepwater
offshore areas are valid for ten years and are nonrenewable while in all
other areas opls are for five years and also are nonrenewable demonstrating
a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion of an opl to an oml

  omls granted prior to the 1969 petroleum act ie under the minerals oils
act 1914 repealed by the 1969 petroleum act were for 30 years onshore and 40
years in offshore areas and are renewable upon 12 months written notice for

information with regard to mining activities follows


  syncrude operations

  syncrude is a jointventure established to recover shallow deposits of tar
sands using openpit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen and to
produce a highquality light 32 degree api sweet synthetic crude oil the
syncrude operation located near fort mcmurray alberta canada exploits a
portion of the athabasca oil sands deposit the location is readily accessible
by public road the produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the syncrude
site to edmonton alberta in the alberta oil sands pipeline owned by the
alberta energy company ltd since startup in 1978 syncrude has produced 12
billion barrels of synthetic crude oil imperial oil limited is the owner of a
25 percent interest in the jointventure exxon mobil corporation has a 696
percent interest in imperial oil limited

  operating license and leases

  syncrude has an operating license issued by the province of alberta which is
effective until 2035 this license permits syncrude to mine tar sands and
produce synthetic crude oil from approved development areas on tar sands
leases syncrude holds eight tar sands leases covering approximately 255000
acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit issued by the province of alberta
the leases are automatically renewable as long as tar sands operations are
ongoing or the leases are part of an approved development plan syncrude
leases 10 12 17 22 and 34 containing proven reserves and leases 29 30
and 31 containing no proven reserves are included within a development plan
approved by the province of albertas department of resource development
there were no known previous commercial operations on these leases prior to
the startup of operations in 1978

  operations plant and equipment

  operations at syncrude involve three main processes open pit mining
extraction of crude bitumen and upgrading of crude bitumen into synthetic
crude oil in the base mine lease 17 the mining and transportation system
uses draglines bucketwheel reclaimers and belt conveyors in the north mine
leases 17 and 22 and in the aurora mine leases 10 12 and 34 a truck
shovel and hydrotransport system is used production from the aurora mine
commenced in 2000 the extraction facilities which separate crude bitumen
from sand are capable of processing approximately 545000 tons of tar sands a
day producing 110 million barrels of crude bitumen a year this represents
recovery capability of about 92 percent of the crude bitumen contained in the
mined tar sands

  crude bitumen extracted from tar sands is refined to a marketable
hydrocarbon product through a combination of carbon removal in two large
hightemperature fluidcoking vessels and by hydrogen addition in high
temperature highpressure hydrocracking vessels these processes remove
carbon and sulfur and reformulate the crude into a low viscosity low sulfur
highquality synthetic crude oil product in 2000 this upgrading process
yielded 0843 barrels of synthetic crude oil per barrel of crude bitumen
about twothirds of the synthetic crude oil is processed by edmonton area
refineries and the remaining onethird is pipelined to refineries in eastern
canada and the midwestern united states electricity is provided to syncrude
by a 270 megawatt electricity generating plant and an 80 megawatt electricity
generating plant both located at syncrude the generating plants are owned by
the syncrude participants imperial oil limiteds 25 percent share of net
investment in plant property and equipment including surface mining
facilities transportation equipment and upgrading facilities is 690 million

  synthetic crude oil reserves

  the crude bitumen is contained within the unconsolidated sands of the
mcmurray formation ore bodies are buried beneath 50 to 150 feet of
overburden have bitumen grades ranging from 4 to 14 weight percent and ore
thickness of 115 to 160 feet estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are
based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of inplace crude
bitumen volume the mining plan historical extraction recovery and upgrading
yield factors installed plant operating capacity and operating approval
limits the inplace volume depth and grade are established through extensive
and closely spaced core drilling proven reserves include the operating base
and north mines and the aurora mine in accordance with the approved mining
plan there are an estimated 3535 million tons of extractable tar sands in
the base and north mines with an average bitumen grade of 104 weight
percent in addition at the aurora mine there are an estimated 1645 million
tons of extractable tar sands at an average bitumen grade of 113 weight
percent after deducting royalties payable to the province of alberta
imperial oil limited estimates its 25 percent net share of proven reserves is
equivalent to 610 million barrels of synthetic crude oil

review of 2000 results

earnings excluding merger effects and special items were 16910 million an
increase of 8530 million from 1999 net income in 2000 of 17720 million
including net favorable merger effects of 810 million increased 9810 million
from 1999 upstream exploration and production earnings benefited from higher
crude oil and natural gas realizations which on average were up about 60
percent and 45 percent respectively versus 1999 excluding the effects of
lower entitlements caused by higher crude prices liquids production was 3
percent higher than 1999 downstream refining and marketing earnings improved
from the very depressed results in 1999 driven by stronger worldwide refining
margins and better refining operations however downstream profitability was
restrained by difficulties in recovering the significant increases in raw
material costs that occurred over much of the year merger implementation
activities in 2000 added a net 810 million to net income reflecting 1730
million of gains from asset divestitures that were a condition of regulatory
approval of the merger these gains more than offset merger implementation
expenses of 920 million results in 1999 included 470 million of net charges
for special items primarily merger expenses with other special items
essentially offsetting revenue for 2000 totaled 233 billion up 25 percent
from 1999 and the cost of crude oil and product purchases increased by 41
percent both influenced by higher prices

  excluding merger expenses the combined total of operating costs including
operating selling general administrative exploration depreciation and
depletion expenses from the consolidated statement of income and exxonmobils
share of similar costs for equity companies in 2000 were 436 billion down
about 700 million from 1999 the impact of efficiency initiatives including
the capture of merger synergies reduced operating costs by 16 billion
interest expense in 2000 was 589 million compared to 695 million in 1999 as
the effect of lower debt levels was partly offset by higher interest rates

upstream

upstream earnings of 12369 million increased due to higher crude oil and
natural gas realizations up about 60 percent and 45 percent respectively
liquids production of 2553 kbd thousands of barrels daily increased from
2517 kbd in 1999 excluding the effects of lower entitlements caused by higher
crude prices liquids production was 3 percent higher than 1999 mainly
reflecting new production from fields in the north sea and venezuela and
increased production from eastern canada and alaska these increases more than
offset the effects of natural field declines natural gas production of 10343
mcfd millions of cubic feet daily was about the same as 1999 reflecting higher
production in eastern canada europe and qatar offset by lower production in
indonesia excluding entitlement impacts natural gas production increased about
1 percent lower exploration expenses also benefited 2000 upstream earnings
earnings from us upstream operations were 4545 million an increase of
2703 million from 1999 earnings outside the us were 7824 million 3899
million higher than last year excluding a 141 million deferred tax benefit and
a 22 million property writeoff in 1999

downstream

downstream earnings of 3418 million improved over 2 billion from the very
depressed results in 1999 driven by stronger worldwide refining margins and
better refining operations earnings also benefited from a planned reduction in
inventories as a result of merging exxon and mobil operations around the world
petroleum product sales of 7993 kbd compared with 8887 kbd in 1999 the
decrease reflected the effects of the required divestiture of mobils european
fuels joint venture and of us marketing and refining assets as well as lower
supply sales in asiapacific resulting from the low margin environment refinery
throughput was 5642 kbd compared with 5977 kbd in 1999 excluding the effects
of the divestments refinery throughput in 2000 was at the same level as 1999
and petroleum product sales were down about 4 percent earnings from us
downstream operations were 1561 million up 984 million from the depressed
results of 1999 reflecting stronger refining margins and improved operations
partly offset by weaker marketing margins earnings outside the us of 1857
million were 1087 million higher than 1999 after excluding special charges in
1999 in japan of 80 million for nonmerger related restructuring of downstream
operations and a 40 million writeoff associated with the cancellation of a
power project the improvement was driven by stronger european and to a much
lesser extent southeast asian refining margins and improved refining operations
partly offset by weaker marketing margins

chemicals

chemicals earnings totaled 1161 million compared with 1354 million in 1999
record prime product sales volumes of 25637 kt thousands of metric tons were
up 354 kt the decline in earnings was driven by higher feedstock and energy
costs and unfavorable foreign exchange effects

other operations

earnings from other operating segments totaled 551 million an increase of 125
million from 1999 reflecting record copper coal and electricity sales higher
copper prices lower operating expenses and favorable foreign exchange effects
partly offset by lower coal prices

corporate and financing

corporate and financing expenses of 589 million compared with 514 million in
1999 the increase resulted from unfavorable foreign

exchange effects and lower taxrelated benefits partly offsetting was a
reduction in administrative expenses as a result of combining exxon and mobil

higher interest rates during the year

review of 1999 results

earnings excluding merger expenses and special items were 8380 million down
426 million or 5 percent from 1998 net income was 7910 million down from
8074 million in 1998 the decline was primarily in the downstream where
steeply rising crude oil costs could not be recovered in the marketplace crude
oil prices rose about 14 per barrel from january to december 1999 depressing
downstream margins in all geographic areas weaker chemicals margins and lower
coal prices also adversely affected earnings however upstream results
benefited from the increase in crude oil prices and partly offset the weakness
in downstream business conditions record chemicals coal and copper volumes and
reduced expenses in every operating segment also benefited earnings results in
1999 included 470 million of net charges for special items  469 million of
merger expenses with other special items essentially offsetting results in 1998
included 732 million of net special charges revenue for 1999 totaled 186
billion up 9 percent from 1998 and the cost of crude oil and product purchases
increased 24 percent

  excluding merger expenses the combined total of operating costs including
operating selling general administrative exploration depreciation and
depletion expenses from the consolidated statement of income and exxonmobils
share of similar costs for equity companies in 1999 was 443 billion down
about 400 million from 1998 the impact of efficiency initiatives including
the capture of early merger synergies reduced operating costs by 12 billion
interest expense in 1999 was 695 million 127 million higher than 1998
mainly due to a higher debt level and unfavorable foreign exchange effects

upstream

upstream earnings of 5886 million increased significantly from 1998 reflecting
higher average crude oil prices up over 5 per barrel from 1998 average us
natural gas prices were 9 percent higher than the prior year while european gas
prices which are tied to petroleum product prices on a lagged basis were about
17 percent lower liquids production of 2517 kbd was up 1 percent from 2502
kbd in 1998 as production from new developments in the north sea the gulf of
mexico west africa and the caspian offset natural field declines in north
america and lower liftings in indonesia and malaysia natural gas production of
10308 mcfd compared with 10617 mcfd in 1998 upstream expenses were reduced
from 1998 levels earnings from the us upstream were 1842 million up 807
million after excluding 185 million of special charges related mainly to
property writedowns in 1998 outside the us upstream earnings were 3925
million up 1247 million after excluding a 141 million deferred tax benefit
and a 22 million property writeoff in 1999 and 176 million of other net
special charges in 1998

downstream

downstream earnings of 1227 million declined from 1998s strong results
primarily reflecting escalating crude oil costs and weaker downstream margins in
all geographic areas unfavorable foreign exchange and inventory effects also
reduced earnings higher volumes mainly in the us and lower operating
expenses provided a partial offset petroleum product sales were 8887 kbd
compared with 8873 kbd in 1998 refinery throughput was 5977 kbd compared with
6093 kbd in 1998 in the us downstream earnings were 577 million down 614
million from 1998 after excluding 8 million of special credits related to
inventory adjustments in 1998 downstream operations outside of the us earned
770 million down 1917 million from 1998 after excluding special charges from
both years results in 1999 included 80 million of charges for nonmerger
related restructuring of japanese downstream operations and a 40 million write
off associated with the cancellation of a power project in japan while 1998
results included 412 million of special charges largely related to the impact
of lower prices on inventories and mobilbritish petroleum bp alliance
implementation costs

chemicals

earnings from chemicals operations totaled 1354 million down 40 million or 3
percent from 1998 industry margins declined due to lower product prices and
higher feedstock costs prime product sales volumes of 25283 kt were a record
earnings also benefited from lower operating expenses chemicals results
included 9 million of special charges related to the impact of lower prices on
inventories in 1998

other operations

earnings from other operating segments totaled 426 million an increase of 42
million from 1998 the increase reflects record copper and coal production
lower operating expenses and favorable foreign exchange effects partly offset
by depressed coal prices

corporate and financing

corporate and financing expenses were 514 million 54 million higher than 1998
which included a net special credit of 112 million related to settlement of
prior years tax disputes excluding special items expenses were 58 million
lower reflecting lower taxrelated charges

merger of exxon corporation and mobil corporation

on november 30 1999 a whollyowned subsidiary of exxon corporation exxon
merged with mobil corporation mobil so that mobil became a whollyowned
subsidiary of exxon the merger at the same time exxon changed its name to
exxon mobil corporation exxonmobil under the terms of the agreement
approximately 10 billion shares of exxonmobil common stock were issued in
exchange for all the outstanding shares of mobil common stock based upon an
exchange ratio of 132015 following the exchange former shareholders of exxon
owned approximately 70 percent of the corporation while former mobil
shareholders owned approximately 30 percent of the corporation each outstanding
share of mobil preferred stock was converted into one share of a new class of
exxonmobil preferred stock

  as a result of the merger the accounts of certain downstream and chemicals
operations jointly controlled by the combining companies have been included in
the consolidated financial statements these operations were previously
accounted for by exxon and mobil as separate companies using the equity method
of accounting

                                       22
page

  the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests accordingly the
consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the merger with
all periods presented as if exxon and mobil had always been combined

  as a condition of the approval of the merger the us federal trade
commission and the european commission required that certain property 
primarily downstream pipeline and natural gas distribution assets  be
divested these assets with a carrying value of approximately 3 billion were
sold in the year 2000 beforetax proceeds for these assets were approximately
5 billion the net aftertax gain of 1730 million was reported as an
extraordinary item consistent with pooling of interests accounting
requirements the properties have historically earned approximately 200
million per year

reorganization costs

in association with the merger between exxon and mobil 1406 million pretax
920 million aftertax and 625 million pretax 469 million aftertax of
costs were recorded as merger related expenses in 2000 and 1999 respectively
cumulative charges included separation expenses related to workforce reductions
approximately 6000 employees at yearend 2000 and merger closing and
implementation costs the separation reserve balance at yearend 2000 of
approximately 320 million is expected to be expended in 2001 merger related
expenses are expected to grow to approximately 25 billion pretax on a
cumulative basis by 2002 pretax operating synergies associated with the
merger which are on track with expectations including cost savings efficiency
gains and revenue enhancements are expected to reach 46 billion per year by
2002

  in the first quarter of 1999 the corporation recorded a 120 million after
tax charge for the reorganization of japanese downstream operations in its
whollyowned esso sekiyu kk and 501 percent owned general sekiyu kk
affiliates the reorganization resulted in the reduction of approximately 700
administrative financial logistics and marketing service employee positions
the japanese affiliates recorded a combined charge of 216 million beforetax
to selling general and administrative expenses for the employee related costs
substantially all cash expenditures anticipated in the restructuring provision
have been paid as of the end of 1999 general sekiyu also recorded a 211
million beforetax charge to depreciation and depletion for the writeoff of
costs associated with the cancellation of a power plant project at the kawasaki
terminal manpower reduction savings associated with this reorganization are
approximately 50 million per year aftertax in 2000

  as indicated in note 4 during 1998 mobil implemented reorganization programs
in australia new zealand and latin america to integrate regional fuels and
lubes operations in 1997 mobil and bp announced that their european
downstream alliance would implement a major reorganization of its lubricant
base oil refining business also in 1997 mobil commenced two major cost
savings initiatives in asiapacific one in japan in response to the
deregulated business environment and the other in australia aftertax costs
for programs initiated in 1998 were 41 million and for the 1997 programs were
189 million benefits associated with these undertakings are estimated at 140
million per year aftertax

capital and exploration expenditures

capital and exploration expenditures in 2000 were 112 billion down from 133
billion in 1999 primarily reflecting timing of completion of major project
expenditures

  upstream spending was down 18 percent to 69 billion in 2000 from 84
billion in 1999 as a result of the completion of major projects in the north
sea canada and south america and lower exploration expenses capital
investments in the downstream totaled 26 billion in 2000 up 02 billion
from 1999 primarily reflecting increased investments in china and higher
spending at us refineries the increase was largely offset by lower spending
in the european fuels joint venture with bp which was divested in 2000 as a
condition of regulatory approval of the merger and lower spending in the
retail businesses chemicals capital expenditures were 15 billion in 2000
down from 22 billion in 1999 due to the completion of major projects in the
united states singapore saudi arabia and thailand

  capital and exploration expenditures in the us totaled 33 billion in
2000 a decrease of 01 billion from 1999 reflecting higher spending in both
the upstream and downstream offset by lower spending in chemicals spending
outside the us of 79 billion in 2000 compared with 99 billion in 1999
reflecting lower expenditures in the upstream and chemicals

  firm commitments related to capital projects totaled approximately 46
billion at the end of 2000 the same as at yearend 1999 the largest single
commitment in 2000 was 23 billion associated with the development of crude
oil and natural gas resources in malaysia the corporation expects to fund the
majority of these commitments through internally generated funds

market risks inflation and other uncertainties

in the past crude product and chemical prices have fluctuated widely in
response to changing market forces the impacts of these price fluctuations on
earnings from upstream operations downstream operations and chemical operations
have been varied tending at times to be offsetting

  the markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price
volatility although prices will occasionally drop precipitously industry
prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and
demand fundamentals accordingly the corporation tests the viability of its
oil and gas operations based on longterm price projections the corporations
assessment is that its operations will

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations

continue to be successful in a variety of market conditions this is the
outcome of disciplined investment and asset management programs

  investment opportunities are tested against a variety of market conditions
including low price scenarios as a result investments that would succeed only
in highly favorable price environments are screened out of the investment plan
in addition the corporation has had an aggressive asset management program in
which underperforming assets are either improved to acceptable levels or
considered for divestment the asset management program involves a disciplined
regular review to ensure that all assets are contributing to the corporations
strategic and financial objectives the result has been the creation of a very
efficient capital base

risk management

the corporations size geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the
upstream downstream and chemicals businesses mitigate the corporations risk
from changes in interest rates currency rates and commodity prices as a
result the corporation makes limited use of derivatives to offset exposures
arising from existing transactions

  interest rate foreign exchange rate and commodity price exposures from the
contracts undertaken in accordance with the corporations policies have not
been significant derivative instruments are not held for trading purposes nor
do they have leveraged features

debtrelated instruments

the corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result
of its shortterm and longterm debt with both fixed and floating interest
rates the corporation makes limited use of interest rate swap agreements to
adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in the debt portfolio the impact
of a 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting the corporations debt
would not be material to earnings cash flow or fair value

foreign currency exchange rate instruments

the corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to
foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales expenses
financing and investment transactions the impacts of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates on exxonmobils geographically diverse operations are
varied and often offsetting in amount the corporation makes limited use of
currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of adverse foreign currency
movements related to certain foreign currency debt obligations exposure from
market rate fluctuations related to these contracts is not material aggregate
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses included in net income are
discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

commodity instruments

the corporation makes limited use of commodity forwards swaps and futures
contracts of short duration to mitigate the risk of unfavorable price movements
on certain crude natural gas and petroleum product purchases and sales
commodity price exposure related to these contracts is not material

inflation and other uncertainties

the general rate of inflation in most major countries of operation has been
relatively low in recent years and the associated impact on operating costs has
been countered by cost reductions from efficiency and productivity improvements

  the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout
the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to time in
varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations such as
forced divestiture of assets restrictions on production imports and exports
price controls tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of
property cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations both
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the
corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable

recently issued statements
of financial accounting standards

in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board released statement no
133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement
no 133 as amended by statements no 137 and 138 must be adopted by the
corporation no later than january 1 2001 the statement establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments it requires that all
derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the financial
statements and measured at fair value it establishes the accounting for changes
in the fair value of the derivatives depending on their intended use since the
corporation makes very limited use of derivatives the effect of adoption on the
corporations operations or financial condition will be negligible

site restoration and other environmental costs

over the years the corporation has accrued provisions for estimated site
restoration costs to be incurred at the end of the operating life of certain of
its facilities and properties in addition the corporation accrues provisions
for environmental liabilities in the many countries in which it does business
when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated this policy applies to assets or businesses currently
owned or previously disposed

  the corporation has accrued provisions for probable environmental remediation
obligations at various sites including multiparty sites where exxonmobil has
been identified as one of the potentially responsible parties by the us
environmental protection agency the involvement of other financially
responsible companies at these multiparty sites mitigates exxonmobils actual
joint and several liability exposure at present no individual site is
expected to have losses material to exxonmobils operations financial
condition or liquidity

  charges made against income for site restoration and environmental
liabilities were 311 million in 2000 219 million in 1999 and 240 million in
1998 at the end of 2000 accumulated site restoration and environmental
provisions after reduction for amounts paid amounted to 37 billion
exxonmobil believes that any cost in excess of the amounts already provided for
in the financial statements would not have a materially adverse effect upon the
corporations operations financial condition or liquidity

                                       24
page

  in 2000 the corporation spent 1529 million of which 393 million were
capital expenditures on environmental projects and expenses worldwide mostly
dealing with air and water conservation total expenditures for such activities
are expected to be about 18 billion in both 2001 and 2002 with capital
expenditures representing about 25 percent of the total

taxes

income excise and all other taxes and duties totaled 684 billion in 2000 an
increase of 69 billion or 11 percent from 1999 income tax expense both
current and deferred was 111 billion compared to 32 billion in 1999
reflecting higher pretax income in 2000 the effective tax rate increased from
318 percent in 1999 to 424 percent in 2000 as a result of a larger share of
total earnings coming from the more highly taxed nonus upstream segment and
lower benefits from resolution of taxrelated issues excise and all other taxes
and duties decreased 10 billion to 573 billion

  income excise and all other taxes and duties totaled 615 billion in 1999
an increase of 16 billion or 3 percent from 1998 income tax expense both
current and deferred was 32 billion compared to 39 billion in 1998
reflecting lower pretax income in 1999 the impact of lower foreign tax rates
and favorable resolution of taxrelated issues the effective tax rate was 318
percent in 1999 versus 352 percent in 1998 excise and all other taxes and
duties increased 23 billion to 583 billion reflecting higher prices

liquidity and capital resources

in 2000 cash provided by operating activities totaled 229 billion up 79
billion from 1999 major sources of funds were net income of 177 billion and
noncash provisions of 81 billion for depreciation and depletion

  cash used in investing activities totaled 33 billion down 77 billion
from 1999 due to higher proceeds from sales of subsidiaries investments and
property plant and equipment resulting from asset divestitures that were
required as a condition of the regulatory approval of the merger and due to
lower additions to property plant and equipment

  cash used in financing activities was 142 billion up 94 billion driven
by debt reductions in the current year versus debt increases in 1999 along
with higher purchases of common shares dividend payments on common shares
increased from 1687 per share to 1760 per share and totaled 61 billion a
payout of 35 percent total consolidated debt declined by 56 billion to 134
billion

  shareholders equity increased by 73 billion to 708 billion the ratio of
debt to capital decreased to 15 percent reflecting lower debt levels and the
higher shareholders equity balance

  prior to the merger the corporation purchased shares of its common stock for
the treasury consistent with pooling accounting requirements this repurchase
program was terminated effective with the close of the exxonmobil merger on
november 30 1999 on august 1 2000 the corporation announced its intention
to purchase shares of its common stock during 2000 exxon mobil corporation
purchased 270 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross
cost of 2352 million these purchases were to offset shares issued in
conjunction with company benefit plans and programs and to reduce the number of
shares outstanding shares outstanding were reduced from 3477 million at the
end of 1999 to 3465 million at the end of 2000 purchases were made in both
the open market and through negotiated transactions and may be discontinued at
any time

  in 1999 cash provided by operating activities totaled 150 billion down
14 billion from 1998 major sources of funds were net income of 79 billion
and noncash provisions of 83 billion for depreciation and depletion

  cash used in investing activities totaled 110 billion down 10 billion
from 1998 primarily as a result of lower additions to property plant and
equipment partly offset by lower sales of subsidiaries and property plant and
equipment

  cash used in financing activities was 48 billion down 24 billion
primarily due to fewer common share purchases dividend payments on common
shares increased from 1666 per share to 1687 per share and totaled 58
billion a payout of 74 percent total consolidated debt increased by 20
billion to 190 billion

  shareholders equity increased by 13 billion to 635 billion the ratio of
debt to capital increased to 22 percent reflecting higher debt levels during
1999 exxon purchased 83 million shares of its common stock for the treasury
at a cost of 648 million these purchases were used to offset shares issued in
conjunction with the companys benefit plans and programs purchases were made
both in the open market and through negotiated transactions consistent with
pooling of interest accounting requirements these repurchases were terminated
effective with the close of the exxonmobil merger on november 30 1999
previously as a consequence of the then proposed merger of exxon and mobil
announced on december 1 1998 both companies repurchase programs to reduce
the number of shares outstanding were discontinued

  although the corporation issues longterm debt from time to time and
maintains a revolving commercial paper program internally generated funds
cover the majority of its financial requirements

  as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements the
corporations financial derivative activities are limited to simple risk
management strategies the corporation does not trade in financial derivatives
nor does it use financial derivatives with leveraged features the corporation
maintains a system of controls that includes a policy covering the
authorization reporting and monitoring of derivative activity the
corporations derivative activities pose no material credit or market risks to
exxonmobils operations financial condition or liquidity

litigation and other contingencies

  as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements a number of
lawsuits including class actions were brought in various courts against exxon
mobil corporation and certain of its subsidiaries relating to the accidental

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations

  on september 24 1996 the united states district court for the district of
alaska entered a judgment in the amount of 5058 billion in the exxon valdez
civil trial that began in may 1994 the district court awarded approximately
196 million in compensatory damages to fisher plaintiffs 38 million in
prejudgment interest on the compensatory damages and 5 billion in punitive
damages to a class composed of all persons and entities who asserted claims for
punitive damages from the corporation as a result of the exxon valdez grounding
the district court also ordered that these awards shall bear interest from and
after entry of the judgment the district court stayed execution on the judgment
pending appeal based on a 675 billion letter of credit posted by the
corporation exxonmobil has appealed the judgment the united states court of
appeals for the ninth circuit heard oral arguments on the appeal on may 3 1999
the corporation continues to believe that the punitive damages in this case are
unwarranted and that the judgment should be set aside or substantially reduced
by the appellate courts the ultimate cost to the corporation from the lawsuits
arising from the exxon valdez grounding is not possible to predict and may not
be resolved for a number of years

  on december 19 2000 a jury in montgomery county alabama returned a
verdict against the corporation in a contract dispute over royalties in the
amount of 8769 million in compensatory damages and 342 billion in punitive
damages in the case of exxon corporation v state of alabama et al exxonmobil
will challenge the verdict and believes that the verdict is unwarranted and
that the judgment should be set aside or substantially reduced the ultimate
outcome is not expected to have a materially adverse effect upon the
corporations operations or financial condition

  the us tax court has decided the issue with respect to the pricing of crude
oil purchased from saudi arabia for the years 19791981 in favor of the
corporation this decision is subject to appeal certain other issues for the
years 19791993 remain pending before the tax court ultimate resolution of
these issues and several other tax and legal issues notably final resolution
of royalty recovery and tax issues related to the gas lifting imbalance in the
common area along the germandutch border is not expected to have a
materially adverse effect upon the corporations operations financial
condition or liquidity

  there are no events or uncertainties known to management beyond those already
included in reported financial information that would indicate a material
change in future operating results or financial condition

participating countries will issue eurodenominated bills and coins by july 1
2002 each country will withdraw its sovereign currency and transactions
thereafter will be conducted solely in euros based on work to date the
conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material effect on the
corporations operations financial condition or liquidity

notes to consolidated financial statements

the corporations principal business is energy involving the worldwide
exploration production transportation and sale of crude oil and natural gas
upstream and the manufacture transportation and sale of petroleum products
downstream the corporation is also a major worldwide manufacturer and
marketer of petrochemicals and participates in coal and minerals mining and
electric power generation

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the
reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ
from these estimates

  the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the supporting and
supplemental material are the responsibility of the management of exxon mobil
corporation

1 summary of accounting policies

principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of those significant subsidiaries owned directly or indirectly with
more than 50 percent of the voting rights held by the corporation and for
which other shareholders do not possess the right to participate in significant
management decisions amounts representing the corporations percentage
interest in the underlying net assets of other significant subsidiaries and
less than majority owned companies in which a significant equity ownership
interest is held are included in investments and advances the corporations
share of the net income of these companies is included in the consolidated
statement of income caption earnings from equity interests and other revenue

  investments in other companies none of which is significant are generally
included in investments and advances at cost or less dividends from these
companies are included in income as received

revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil natural gas
petroleum and chemical products and all other items are recorded when title
passes to the customer

  revenues from the production of natural gas properties in which the
corporation has an interest with the other producers are recognized on the
basis of the companys net working interest differences between actual
production and net working interest volumes are not significant

derivative instruments as discussed in footnote 14 the corporation makes
limited use of derivative instruments to hedge its exposures associated with
interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices gains
and losses on hedging contracts are recognized concurrent with the recognition
of the economic impact of the underlying exposures using either the accrual or
deferral method of accounting in order to qualify for hedge accounting the
derivative instrument must be designated and effective as a hedge

  the accrual method is used for interest rate swaps crosscurrency interest
rate swaps and commodity swaps under the accrual method differentials in the
swapped amounts are recorded as adjustments of the underlying periodic cash
flows that are being hedged if these swaps are terminated the gains and
losses are amortized over the original lives of such contracts the deferral
method is used for futures exchange contracts forward contracts and commodity
swaps gains and losses resulting from changes in value of derivative
instruments are deferred and recognized in the same period as the gains and
losses of the items being hedged

  cash flow from derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting is
included in the same category for cash flow purposes as the item being hedged

inventories crude oil products and merchandise inventories are carried at the
lower of current market value or cost generally determined under the lastin
firstout method  lifo costs include applicable purchase costs and operating
expenses but not general and administrative expenses or research and
development costs inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or
less

property plant and equipment depreciation depletion and amortization based
on cost less estimated salvage value of the asset are primarily determined
under either the unitofproduction method or the straightline method unit
ofproduction rates are based on oil gas and other mineral reserves estimated
to be recoverable from existing facilities the straightline method of
depreciation is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into
consideration

  maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred major renewals and
improvements are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired

  the corporations upstream activities are accounted for under the successful
efforts method under this method costs of productive wells and development
dry holes both tangible and intangible as well as productive acreage are
capitalized and amortized on the unitofproduction method costs of that
portion of undeveloped acreage likely to be unproductive based largely on
historical experience are amortized over the period of exploration other
exploratory expenditures including geophysical costs other dry hole costs and
annual lease rentals are expensed as incurred exploratory wells that find oil
and gas in an area requiring a major capital expenditure before production
could begin are evaluated annually to assure that commercial quantities of
reserves have been found or that additional exploration work is underway or
planned exploratory well costs not meeting either of these tests are charged
to expense

  oil gas and other properties held and used by the corporation are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amounts may not be recoverable the corporation estimates the future
undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability
of carrying amounts in general analyses are based on proved reserves except
in circumstances where it is probable that additional resources will be
developed and contribute to cash flows in the future

environmental conservation and site restoration costs liabilities for
environmental conservation are recorded when it is probable that obligations
have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated these
liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties and
projected cash expenditures are not discounted

  site restoration costs that may be incurred by the corporation at the end of
the operating life of certain of its facilities and properties are reserved
ratably over the assets productive life

foreign currency translation the functional currency for translating the
accounts of the majority of downstream and chemical operations outside the us
is the local currency local currency is also used for upstream operations that
are relatively selfcontained and integrated within a particular country such
as in canada the united kingdom norway and continental europe the us
dollar is used for operations in highly inflationary economies in singapore
which is predominantly export oriented and for some upstream operations
primarily in malaysia indonesia nigeria equatorial guinea and the middle
east for all operations gains or losses on remeasuring foreign currency
transactions into functional currency are included in income

2 extraordinary item and accounting change

net income for 2000 included a net aftertax gain of 1730 million net of 308
million of income taxes or 049 per common share  assuming dilution from
asset divestments that were required as a condition of the regulatory approval
of the merger the net aftertax gain on required divestments was reported as an
extraordinary item according to accounting requirements for business
combinations accounted for as a pooling of interests

  effective as of january 1 1998 the corporation adopted the american
institute of certified public accountants statement of position 985
reporting on the costs of startup activities this statement requires that
costs of startup activities and organizational costs be expensed as incurred
the cumulative effect of this accounting change on years prior to 1998 was a
charge of 70 million net of 70 million income tax effect or 002 per
common share

3 merger of exxon corporation and mobil corporation

on november 30 1999 a whollyowned subsidiary of exxon corporation exxon
merged with mobil corporation mobil so that mobil became a whollyowned
subsidiary of exxon the merger at the same time exxon changed its name to
exxon mobil corporation exxonmobil under the terms of the agreement
approximately 10 billion shares of exxonmobil common stock were issued in
exchange for all the outstanding shares of mobil common stock based upon an
exchange ratio of 132015 following the exchange former shareholders of exxon
owned approximately 70 percent of the corporation while former mobil
shareholders owned approximately 30 percent of the corporation each outstanding
share of mobil preferred stock was converted into one share of a new class of
exxonmobil preferred stock

  as a result of the merger the accounts of certain downstream and chemicals
operations jointly controlled by the combining companies have been included in
the consolidated financial statements these operations were previously
accounted for by exxon and mobil as separate companies using the equity method
of accounting

  the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests accordingly the
consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the merger with
all periods presented as if exxon and mobil had always been combined certain
reclassifications have been made to conform the presentation of exxon and
mobil

the following table sets forth summary data for the separate companies and the
combined amounts for periods prior to the merger

and the european commission required that certain property  primarily
downstream pipeline and natural gas distribution assets  be divested these
assets with a carrying value of approximately 3 billion were sold in the year

item the properties have historically earned approximately 200 million per
year

depreciation and depletion for the writeoff of costs associated with the
cancellation of a power plant project at the kawasaki terminal

  in 1998 mobil implemented new reorganization programs in australia and new
zealand and in latin america to integrate regional fuels and lubes operations
these programs resulted in the elimination of approximately 500 positions as
well as asset writedowns in australia and new zealand a provision of 50
million 41 million aftertax was recorded in selling general and
administrative expenses and depreciation and depletion for these programs in
1998 and 1999 a combination of cash for employee separation benefits and exit
costs and noncash costs for the closure of facilities essentially depleted the
reserve

13 employee stock ownership plans

in 1989 the exxon leveraged employee stock ownership plan exxon lesop trust
borrowed 1000 million under the terms of notes guaranteed by exxon maturing
between 1990 and 1999 as further described in note 12 the exxon lesop trust
used the proceeds of the borrowing to purchase shares of exxons convertible
class a preferred stock the final exxon lesop note matured in 1999 with the
final principal payment of the outstanding debt all remaining shares of exxon
class a preferred stock were converted to exxonmobil common shares

  in 1989 the mobil oil corporation employee stock ownership plan mobil esop
trust borrowed 800 million under the terms of notes and debentures guaranteed
by mobil as further described in note 12 the trust used the proceeds of the
borrowing to purchase shares of mobils series b convertible preferred stock
which upon the merger were converted into shares of exxonmobil class b
preferred stock with similar terms by yearend 1999 all outstanding shares of
class b preferred stock were converted to exxonmobil common shares

  the exxon lesop and mobil esop were merged in late 1999 to create the
exxonmobil esop employees eligible to participate in exxonmobils savings plan
may elect to participate in the exxonmobil esop corporate contributions to the
plan and dividends are used to make principal and interest payments on the
notes and debentures as contributions and dividends are credited common
shares are allocated to participants accounts when debt service exceeded
dividends exxonmobil funded the excess the excess for the exxonmobil esop was
15 million 19 million and 15 million in 2000 1999 and 1998
respectively

  accounting for the plans has followed the principles which were in effect for
the respective plans when they were established the amount of compensation
expense related to the plans and recorded by the corporation during the periods
was not significant the exxonmobil esop trust held 599 million shares of
exxonmobil common stock at the end of 1999 and 546 million shares at the end
of 2000

14 financial instruments

the fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various
market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate longterm debt is
the only category of financial instruments whose fair value differs materially
from the recorded book value the estimated fair value of total longterm debt
including capitalized lease obligations at december 31 2000 and 1999 was
80 billion and 89 billion respectively as compared to recorded book
values of 73 billion and 84 billion

  the corporations size geographic diversity and the complementary nature of
the upstream downstream and chemicals businesses mitigate the corporations
risk from changes in interest rate foreign currency rate and commodity prices
as a result the corporation makes limited use of derivatives to offset
exposures arising from existing transactions derivative instruments are not
held for trading purposes nor do they have leveraged features in addition
they are either purchased or sold over authorized exchanges or with
counterparties of high credit standing as a result of the above factors the
corporations exposure to credit risks and market risks from derivative
activities is negligible

the notional principal amounts of derivative financial instruments at december
31 are as follows

16 incentive program

the 1993 incentive program provides for grants of stock options stock
appreciation rights sars restricted stock and other forms of award awards
may be granted over a 10year period to eligible employees of the corporation
and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned the number of shares of stock
which may be awarded each year under the 1993 incentive program may not exceed
seven tenths of one percent 07 of the total number of shares of common
stock of the corporation outstanding excluding shares held by the corporation
on december 31 of the preceding year if the total number of shares effectively
granted in any year is less than the maximum number of shares allowable the
balance may be carried over thereafter outstanding awards are subject to
certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument

  options and sars may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of
market value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years most of
the options and sars normally first become exercisable one year following the
date of grant

  on the closing of the merger on november 30 1999 outstanding options and
sars granted by mobil under its 1995 incentive compensation and stock
ownership plan and prior plans were assumed by exxonmobil and converted into
rights to acquire exxonmobil common stock with adjustments to reflect the
exchange ratio no further awards may be granted under the former mobil plans

  shares available for granting under the 1993 incentive program were 59536
thousand at the beginning of 2000 and 42303 thousand at the end of 2000 at
december 31 1999 and 2000 respectively 1077 thousand and 1219 thousand
shares of restricted common stock were outstanding

  statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stock
based compensation was implemented in january 1996 as permitted by the
standard exxonmobil retained its prior method of accounting for stock
compensation if the provisions of statement no 123 had been adopted net

been reduced by 296 million or 008 per share in 2000 149 million or
004 per share in 1999 and 134 million or 004 per share in 1998 for the
exxonmobil plan the average fair value of each option granted during 2000
1999 and 1998 was 2036 1970 and 1280 respectively the fair value was
estimated at the grant date using an optionpricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions for 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively riskfree
interest rates of 55 percent 62 percent and 48 percent expected life of 6
years for all years volatility of 16 percent 15 percent and 13 percent and a
dividend yield of 20 percent 21 percent and 23 percent for the mobil
plans the average fair value of each mobil option granted during 1999 and
1998 was 1702 and 1305 respectively the fair value was estimated at the
grant date using an optionpricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions for 1999 and 1998 respectively riskfree interest rates of 52
percent and 57 percent expected life of 5 years for both years volatility
of 20 percent and 18 percent and a dividend yield of 27 percent and 32

notes to consolidated financial statements

17 litigation and other contingencies

a number of lawsuits including class actions were brought in various courts
against exxon mobil corporation and certain of its subsidiaries relating to the
accidental release of crude oil from the tanker exxon valdez in 1989
essentially all of these lawsuits have now been resolved or are subject to
appeal

  on september 24 1996 the united states district court for the district of
alaska entered a judgment in the amount of 5058 billion in the exxon valdez
civil trial that began in may 1994 the district court awarded approximately
196 million in compensatory damages to fisher plaintiffs 38 million in
prejudgment interest on the compensatory damages and 5 billion in punitive
damages to a class composed of all persons and entities who asserted claims for
punitive damages from the corporation as a result of the exxon valdez
grounding the district court also ordered that these awards shall bear
interest from and after entry of the judgment the district court stayed
execution on the judgment pending appeal based on a 675 billion letter of
credit posted by the corporation exxonmobil has appealed the judgment the
united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit heard oral arguments on
the appeal on may 3 1999 the corporation continues to believe that the
punitive damages in this case are unwarranted and that the judgment should be
set aside or substantially reduced by the appellate courts

  on january 29 1997 a settlement agreement was concluded resolving all
remaining matters between the corporation and various insurers arising from the
valdez accident under terms of this settlement exxonmobil received 480
million final income statement recognition of this settlement continues to be
deferred in view of uncertainty regarding the ultimate cost to the corporation
of the valdez accident

  the ultimate cost to exxonmobil from the lawsuits arising from the exxon
valdez grounding is not possible to predict and may not be resolved for a
number of years

  under the october 8 1991 civil agreement and consent decrees with the us
and alaska governments the corporation will make a final payment of 70
million in 2001 this payment along with prior payments will be charged
against the provision that was previously established to cover the costs of the
settlement

  german and dutch affiliated companies are the concessionaires of a natural
gas field subject to a treaty between the governments of germany and the
netherlands under which the gas reserves in an undefined border or common area
are to be shared equally entitlement to the reserves is determined by
calculating the amount of gas which can be recovered from this area based on
the final reserve determination the german affiliate has received more gas
than its entitlement arbitration proceedings as provided in the agreements
were conducted to resolve issues concerning the compensation for the overlifted
gas

  by final award dated july 2 1999 preceded by an interim award in 1996 an
arbitral tribunal established the full amount of the compensation for the
excess gas this amount has now been paid and a petition to set the award aside
has now been dismissed rendering the award final in all respects other
substantive matters remain outstanding including recovery of royalties paid on
such excess gas and the taxes payable on the final compensation amount the net
financial impact on the corporation is not possible to predict at this time
however the ultimate outcome is not expected to have a materially adverse
effect upon the corporations operations or financial condition

  on december 19 2000 a jury in montgomery county alabama returned a
verdict against the corporation in a contract dispute over royalties in the
amount of 8769 million in compensatory damages and 342 billion in punitive
damages in the case of exxon corporation v state of alabama et al exxonmobil
will challenge the verdict and believes that the verdict is unwarranted and
that the judgement should be set aside or substantially reduced the ultimate
outcome is not expected to have a materially adverse effect upon the
corporations operations or financial condition

  the us tax court has decided the issue with respect to the pricing of crude
oil purchased from saudi arabia for the years 19791981 in favor of the
corporation this decision is subject to appeal certain other issues for the
years 19791993 remain pending before the tax court the ultimate resolution of
these issues is not expected to have a materially adverse effect upon the
corporations operations or financial condition

  claims for substantial amounts have been made against exxonmobil and certain
of its consolidated subsidiaries in other pending lawsuits the outcome of
which is not expected to have a materially adverse effect upon the
corporations operations or financial condition

  the corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were
contingently liable at december 31 2000 for 2184 million primarily
relating to guarantees for notes loans and performance under contracts this
includes 770 million representing guarantees of nonus excise taxes and
customs duties of other companies entered into as a normal business practice
under reciprocal arrangements not included in this figure are guarantees by
consolidated affiliates of 1715 million representing exxonmobils share of
obligations of certain equity companies

  additionally the corporation and its affiliates have numerous longterm
sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities all of
which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the
corporations operations or financial condition

  the operations and earnings of the corporation and its affiliates throughout
the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to time in
varying degree by political developments and laws and regulations such as
forced divestiture of assets restrictions on production imports and exports
price controls tax increases and retroactive tax claims expropriation of
property cancellation of contract rights and environmental regulations both
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect upon the
corporation vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable

notes to consolidated financial statements

the data shown on the previous page are reported as required by current
accounting standards which specify use of a discount rate at which
postretirement liabilities could be effectively settled the discount rate
stipulated for use in calculating yearend postretirement liabilities is based
on the yearend rate of interest on high quality bonds for determining the
funding requirements of us annuity plans in accordance with applicable
federal government regulations exxonmobil uses the expected longterm rate of
return of the annuity funds actual portfolio as the discount rate this rate
has historically been higher than bonds as the majority of pension assets are
invested in equities in fact the actual rate earned over the past decade has
been 15 percent on this basis all funded us plans meet the full funding
requirements of the department of labor and the internal revenue service as
detailed in the table below certain smaller us plans and a number of non
us plans are not funded because of local tax conventions and regulatory
practices which do not encourage funding of these plans book reserves have
been established for these plans to provide for future benefit payments

4852 million less at yearend 2000 and 4593 million less at yearend 1999
than the amounts reported as investments in property plant and equipment for
the upstream in note 10 this is due to the exclusion from capitalized costs of
certain transportation and research assets and assets relating to the tar sands
and lng operations and to the inclusion of accumulated provisions for site
restoration costs all as required in statement of financial accounting
standards no 19

costs charged to expense during the year total worldwide costs incurred in

oil and gas reserves

the following information describes changes during the years and balances of
proved oil and gas reserves at yearend 1998 1999 and 2000

  the definitions used are in accordance with applicable securities and
exchange commission regulations

  proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil
natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from
known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions ie prices
and costs as of the date the estimate is made prices include consideration of
changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not
on escalations based upon future conditions in some cases substantial new
investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to
recover these proved reserves

  proved reserves include 100 percent of each majority owned affiliates
participation in proved reserves and exxonmobils ownership percentage of the
proved reserves of equity companies but exclude royalties and quantities due
others gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be
removed from the gas on leases at field facilities and at gas processing
plants these liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and
natural gas liquids

 supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities

  net proved developed reserves are those volumes which are expected to be
recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods
undeveloped reserves are those volumes which are expected to be recovered as a
result of future investments to drill new wells to recomplete existing wells
andor to install facilities to collect and deliver the production from
existing and future wells

  reserves attributable to certain oil and gas discoveries were not considered
proved as of yearend 2000 due to geological technological or economic
uncertainties and therefore are not included in the tabulation

  crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas production quantities shown
are the net volumes withdrawn from exxonmobils oil and gas reserves the
natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of gas delivered for sale by
the producing function as reported on page 57 due to volumes consumed or flared
and inventory changes such quantities amounted to approximately 242 billion
cubic feet in 1998 391 billion cubic feet in 1999 and 392 billion cubic feet
in 2000

information on canadian tar sands proven reserves not included above

in addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves exxonmobil
has significant interests in proven tar sands reserves in canada associated with
the syncrude project for internal management purposes exxonmobil views these
reserves and their development as an integral part of total upstream operations
however us securities and exchange commission regulations define these
reserves as mining related and not a part of conventional oil and gas reserves

  the tar sands reserves are not considered in the standardized measure of
discounted future cash flows for conventional oil and gas reserves which is
found on page 55

standardized measure of discounted future cash flows

as required by the financial accounting standards board the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed by applying yearend
prices costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10 percent to
net proved reserves the corporation believes the standardized measure is not
meaningful and may be misleading
